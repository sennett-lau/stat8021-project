In March 2009, American Scott Parazynski – a veteran of five Nasa space shuttle missions, including seven spacewalks, who had racked up more than 23 million miles (37 million km) – hung up his spacesuit.
“I could have flown once, maybe twice more, but I was keen to stretch my wings as an inventor and entrepreneur,” says the 63-year-old.
Undeterred, he tried again the following year, and this time succeeded in conquering Earth’s highest mountain above sea level. He reached the top at 4am on May 20, 2009, making him the first person to have flown in space and summited the world’s highest peak.
Parazynski is a doctor by training – he was the personal doctor to his hero John Glenn aboard the Discovery shuttle on the then-US senator’s return to space in 1998.
HIs other adventurous feats include scuba diving deep into a volcanic lake in the Andes mountains of South America, making the first descent into Nicaragua’s Masaya volcano and visiting Antarctica, where he oversaw the medical care of staff of the US government’s Antarctic programme."

A Hong Kong district councillor has been struck by a falling piece of concrete while moving supplies with a care team in a public housing estate.
Police received a report shortly after noon on Saturday that a woman had been hit on the head by a falling piece of concrete at Yiu Tung Estate in Shau Kei Wan.
“The woman was conscious and was subsequently sent to the Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital [in Chai Wan],” a force spokesman said.
The Post has learned that district councillor Ng Ching-ching was the victim. She was handling supplies with care team members at Yiu Wa House, a building in the estate, when the accident happened.
Lawmaker Aron Kwok Wai-keung of the Federation of Trade Unions in Hong Kong, of which Ng was also a member, told the Post on Sunday that the district councillor needed rest.
“The entire party is very concerned about Ng, but the severity of her injuries can only be confirmed after medical checks. Ng is known to be a hardworking district councillor, this incident will not hinder FTU members’ dedication to serve communities,” Kwok said."

A feted left-wing French theatre company based in a park outside Paris is soul-searching after accusations it has left underage volunteers vulnerable to sexual abuse.
The Theatre du Soleil, a collective based since 1970 in a disused munitions factory in the Bois de Vincennes park east of the capital, is famed for its critically acclaimed plays.
It is also known for paying all its members the same salary, and until recently demanded that even lead actors help out in the kitchen.
But the troupe says it has been in shock since a former volunteer last month alleged “attempted rape” at the theatre in 2010 as part of a parliamentary inquiry examining sexual abuse in the arts.
The probe’s final report – a major achievement in France’s #Metoo movement – on Wednesday called on the creative industry to stamp out what it called “endemic” mistreatment of performers.
As part of the probe, actress Agathe Pujol, in her early thirties, told a parliamentary inquiry that a 39-year-old actor attempted to rape her in front of “several witnesses” at a party at the Theatre du Soleil in December 2010."

A significant number of ferry trips from Hong Kong to the mainland have been cancelled due to expected thunderstorms hitting the city on Saturday afternoon.
The Hong Kong Observatory reported that a cold front moving southward from northern Guangdong province was bringing showers and squally thunderstorms closer to the Pearl River Estuary.
They warned that the rain would be heavy in some areas, with potentially violent gusts later in the afternoon and into the evening.
“Showers would be heavier in some areas and there might also be violent gusts later in the afternoon to around the evening,” the Hong Kong Observatory said.
“Winds will strengthen significantly, occasionally reaching gale force offshore and on high ground,” it added.
As the cold front moves across coastal areas, local winds will shift to northerly, causing a significant drop in temperature. The forecaster noted that it was “relatively rare” for the northeast monsoon to be this strong in April."

When Samsung Electronics chairman Jay Y. Lee met Vietnam’s prime minister in July, he had a simple message to convey. “Vietnam’s success is Samsung’s success, and Vietnam’s development is Samsung’s development,” Lee told Pham Minh Chinh, pledging long-term investment to make the country its biggest manufacturing base for display products.
Since the South Korean conglomerate entered Vietnam in 1989, it has poured billions of dollars into expanding its global manufacturing footprint beyond China. Many of its peers followed after US President Donald Trump placed tariffs on Chinese goods in his first term.
The pioneering move has made Samsung Vietnam’s biggest foreign investor and exporter. About 60 per cent of the 220 million phones Samsung sells each year globally are made in Vietnam, and many are destined for the United States, where Samsung is the No 2 smartphone vendor, according to research firm Counterpoint.
Now, that reliance on Vietnam threatens to backfire as Hanoi is racing to negotiate with the Trump administration to lower a punishing potential 46 per cent tariff that has exposed the vulnerability of the Southeast Asian country’s export model.
While Vietnam and Samsung won a reprieve this week after Trump paused the rate at 10 per cent for 90 days, Reuters interviews with more than a dozen people, including at Samsung and its suppliers, show the company would be a primary victim should higher US tariffs take effect in July."

Vultures have an image crisis. Seen as ugly and associated with death, they are among the least loved animals in the world. But conservationists in Africa are trying to change that.
They have launched an effort to save endangered vultures by trying to put a dollar figure on their incredible value.
A recent report by the BirdLife International conservation organisation has estimated that vultures are worth US$1.8 billion a year to certain ecosystems in southern Africa, which might surprise anyone not familiar with the clean-up, pest control and anti-poaching work performed by one of the most efficient scavengers on the planet.
“They are not up there on the pretty scale. And they are not popular. But we know they are very useful,” said Fadzai Matsvimbo, an extinction prevention coordinator at BirdLife International.
The report comes at an important time for Africa’s vultures; six of the 11 species found on the continent are listed as endangered or critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which says vultures are highly threatened in many parts of the world. In Africa, some species have declined by nearly 90 per cent, according to Matsvimbo.
Conservationists hope the report will make authorities and the public more aware of the positive impact of vultures."

The bidding for three pilot areas in a Hong Kong megaproject near the border will be successful despite rising economic uncertainties caused by escalating tensions between the United States and China, the development chief has said.
Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn Hon-ho also said on Saturday that two of the projects within the Northern Metropolis would be tendered this year with initial construction results delivered and completed within two years.
Linn dismissed the possibility of a failed tender for the first three developments. She said the government would formulate tender conditions acceptable to the market to attract investors, following the expression of interest by potential bidders.
“We hope to complete tendering for at least one or two projects within the second half of the year. For the tendering of the San Tin Technopole, we will have until next year at the earliest for the government to acquire land by resumption,” she told a radio programme.
“Having collected two rounds of expressions of interest, we can draft precise tender terms to cater to their needs. I am confident that we can successfully tender out the projects.”
Linn said that she expected developers to deliver some results within two years after the commencement of their projects, with a total time frame of six to seven years for completion."

Beijing has been hit by its strongest winds in decades, causing flights and public transport to be suspended while millions of residents in the Chinese capital were told to stay at home on Saturday.
The winds, caused by a cold vortex sweeping in from Mongolia, prompted the meteorological bureau to issue an orange-level warning – the second highest in a four-tier system – for strong winds on Friday afternoon.
The winds, which battered much of northern China, including Tianjin and Hebei province, were also predicted to bring sandstorms with dust reaching as far as Shanghai.
The extreme weather also saw thunderstorms and darkened skies across large areas. Residents in some areas were sealing their windows to stop them falling in and multiple trees were reported to have fallen in Beijing.
Most weather stations in the city reported winds of Force 7 or above from Friday afternoon, with some reaching Force 14 – with some forecasters predicting the strongest April winds in the capital since 1951.
The highest recorded wind speed, in the Gaoshan Rose Garden in Mentogou district, was 162km/h."

United States President Donald Trump has unleashed a trade war by imposing “reciprocal tariffs” on about 90 countries across the globe.
After temporarily dropping the new tariffs to 10 per cent for 90 days on April 9 to allow trade negotiations with those countries, he hit China harder and raised the levy on Chinese imports to a whopping 145 per cent. Beijing vowed to “fight to the end” and slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on American goods in retaliation.
Despite being a free port, Hong Kong has not been spared from the crossfire. The Post examines the central and local governments’ strategies to mitigate the impact of the trade war and support businesses.
The United States is the city’s second-largest export market, accounting for US$37.9 billion in merchandise in 2024, with telecommunications equipment and parts taking up the greatest share, followed by computers, precious stones, jewellery, semiconductors and electronic valves and tubes.
The levies under Trump’s executive order issued on April 2 to impose an additional 34 per cent tariffs on China will also apply to Hong Kong. But the extra tariffs have now hit 145 per cent, bringing the effective tariff rate to about 156 per cent, after repeated salvoes between Beijing and Washington.
Economics professor Terence Chong Tai-leung, executive director of the Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance at Chinese University of Hong Kong, warned local companies which exported its products mainly to the US market would bear the brunt of the tariffs."

Bah is currently with Tai Po, after the Hong Kong Premier League leaders were impressed by the midfielder’s succession of dynamic early-season performances for Football Club.
The 29-year-old called the January move an opportunity to grow as “a player and as man”, although he has been doing that since he left his native Guinea at the age of 18.
Bah lost both of his parents in 2007, when he was 11, before living with an aunt and uncle.
“It was a very tough life as a child,” Bah said. “But there were so many nice people outside the family who loved me because of my football. I spent most of my childhood outside the house. I was a street boy.”
A family issue ultimately led to Bah leaving his home country for Malaysia, with the aid of a friend."

A Chinese CEO and influencer, who became popular in Japan after taking part in a reality dating show, has ignited a flurry of online reactions after defending unruly Chinese tourists and expressing a desire to correct stereotypes.
The controversy emerged recently when Chinese entrepreneur Huang Hao was confronted with a challenge from a Japanese netizen who said: “It is really annoying to see a bunch of rude Chinese people.”
Born in Shanghai and educated in Japan, Huang is an alumnus of the prestigious Waseda University and launched his own business. He currently has almost 220,000 followers on one social media platform.
He rose to popularity in Japan after appearing on the hit dating reality show The Bachelor Japan, where he was the bachelor in Season 4 in 2021, and had to choose from 15 women vying for his affection.
Huang was challenged by an online commenter who said: “Seeing a group of rude Chinese tourists really annoys me. Are there not any polite Chinese people like your father? Or is it that polite Chinese people just do not come to Japan?”
He responded by saying: “These words are from my heart. To be honest, I sometimes find it annoying too.”"

Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto has said the Gaza war is undermining the foundations of a Western-backed, rules-based international order and humanitarian ideology in light of the relentless loss of civilian lives.
Prabowo, who was the only Southeast Asian head of state to speak at the three-day Antalya Diplomacy Forum in Turkey on Friday, said the violence and unilateral decisions by the West were only leading the world towards unrest with little say for emerging nations.
“The situation in Gaza is teaching the world that many of the great powers that espouse great ideals, now in the eyes of the Global South have fallen short,” he said, adding it was inconceivable how Western powers were keeping quiet over the situation.
The Indonesian president cut a stoic figure, at times sombre, as he also reflected how he had to work hard on issues his people felt deeply about, such as Gaza, as they viewed Israel’s actions as an attack on humanity and on Muslims.
“How can a six-year-old boy or girl be guilty of anything?” he asked, referring to the loss of children’s lives in the war. “It is something which is very hard to digest.”
Violence has renewed in Gaza since a truce between Israel and Hamas fell apart last month, with both sides blaming each other for the breakdown."

Brazil’s far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro was airlifted to a hospital after suffering a painful bowel obstruction on Friday that forced him to abandon a political tour – his latest health complication six years after being stabbed in the stomach.
The 70-year-old, who is seeking to make a political comeback even as he faces a criminal trial, started feeling “unbearable abdominal pain” at a political event on Friday in the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte, a senior member of his Liberal Party said.
He was brought to a hospital where he was “stabilised”, according to right-wing senator Rogerio Marinho, then flown by helicopter to a bigger facility in the state capital, Natal.
Bolsonaro “remains under observation and will spend the night in hospital”, Luiz Roberto Fonseca, medical director of the Rio Grande hospital, told a news conference late on Friday.
Surgeon Helio Barreto added that “for the moment, no surgery is planned”, adding that the ex-president had seen “improvement” with “decreased pain”."

Asparagus season has arrived in Germany, signalling the unofficial beginning of spring.
There is no other vegetable that Germans obsess about as much as white asparagus. They can discuss for hours whether it should be eaten with melted butter or Hollandaise sauce, served with smoked ham or schnitzel, or with a side of potatoes boiled whole or peeled, cut into slices and fried with bacon and onion.
There’s also some debate over whether you can eat the shoots with your fingers or only with a fork and knife – although traditional etiquette clearly states that using your fingers is no violation of good manners as long as you dip and clean them in a little bowl of warm water.
The only thing Germans can agree on when it comes to their favourite vegetable is that green asparagus comes nowhere close to its white companion and may as well be ignored.
“White asparagus is definitely more delicate in taste,” said Sven Sperling, 54, who was enjoying his first dish of the year at the Jakobs-Hof asparagus restaurant in Beelitz, just outside Berlin. “It’s something very special. It’s not possible to compare it to green asparagus.”"

US and Iranian officials began their most consequential nuclear talks in a decade on Saturday, with both sides under immense pressure to avert a collapse that could lead to war.
At the centre of the discussions is Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, whose agenda – delivered either directly or via Omani intermediaries – will determine whether Tehran adopts a cooperative or combative stance, analysts say.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi leads a delegation wary of appearing weak amid Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s firm opposition to negotiating under the weight of US sanctions Trump reinstated in February this year.
“What both sides have to agree on first and foremost is the parameters of the talks,” said geopolitical risk analyst Andreas Krieg, an associate professor of defence studies at King’s College London.
“At this point, both sides are not in agreement about what is on the table and what can be negotiated, hence the talks in Oman are very, very important.”"

Foreign business chambers in China say that companies from their respective countries are worried in the face of mounting uncertainties from the intensifying trade war with the US, fearing that this could be just the beginning.
Among them are American firms, who contend that higher tariffs will hurt consumers around the world.
“Many of our member companies, and upstream and downstream partners, rely on the flow of goods to and from the US. The reciprocal tariffs and China’s countermeasures will have a significant, long-lasting impact,” the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai’s president, Eric Zheng, said in a statement to the Post.
“It is in the best interest of both countries to negotiate and find alternative measures to manage trade disputes … AmCham Shanghai is committed to the principles of free trade and open markets,” Zheng added.
Meanwhile, a former chair of AmCham China said that the way the Trump administration goes around slapping tariffs will not help the broad swathe of American firms in China.
“Threats and bullying by the White House won’t help American business achieve greater market access for American goods and services,” said James Zimmerman, who is now a Beijing-based lawyer."

“Our clients set their sales targets based on the population and the demographic structure of their cities. It is very important for us,” he said.
Chen has spent more than a decade in the wedding photo industry and travels to different cities to train clients. Over the years he has sensed differences between cities with growing populations and those with shrinking ones.
Business in his hometown of Chengdu is stable. It is one of the few cities that managed to attract a substantial number of migrants last year, helping to boost the population by 71,000 people, or 0.33 per cent, compared to a year earlier.
But a shrinking population has cast a long shadow over other regions. Business in many cities – from the northeastern provinces to Beijing – has been gloomy.
“Overall, the population nationwide is shrinking and with people getting married at a much older age, we earn a lot less than a few years ago,” he said.
Chen is among the many people in business and elsewhere who have felt the pinch of China’s population crisis, which has led to shrinking cities. The implications are sweeping: from abandoned buildings and a shrinking workforce and consumer market, to smaller fiscal revenues for local governments."

Wealthy Indonesians are shifting hundreds of millions of dollars offshore amid mounting concerns over President Prabowo Subianto’s fiscal discipline and the country’s economic stability.
Gold and real estate are two popular havens although a third, less traditional, pocket has emerged: cryptocurrencies – in particular Tether Holdings SA’s stablecoin USDT, which is designed to maintain a 1:1 peg to the US dollar. The assets all offer ways for the country’s rich to skirt scrutiny in moving large sums of money around.
Bloomberg News spoke to more than a dozen wealth managers, private bankers, advisers and high-net-worth individuals for this story, all of whom asked not to be identified discussing confidential information.
One private banker said that several Indonesian clients with a net worth of between US$100 million and US$400 million had converted up to 10 per cent of their assets into crypto. The shift began in October when Prabowo came to power but accelerated substantially after the rupiah plunged in March, the person said.
The outflows from Southeast Asia’s biggest economy may have contributed to the steep decline in Indonesia’s currency. The rupiah on Wednesday fell to its lowest in history against the dollar before rebounding slightly on Thursday as investors priced in the impact of rising trade frictions from US President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs."

The number of community nannies under a Hong Kong childcare programme declined sharply by more than 40 per cent from 2023 to last year, with industry players attributing the dip partly to carers’ fears over abuse allegations following an earlier scandal that tarnished the service.
The figure dropped sharply by 41 per cent from 1,770 recorded over the same period in 2023.
“Some doubted their own abilities to take care of children or meet parents’ high demands, while some also worried about being suspected of child abuse,” said Jessie Yu Sau-chu, chief executive of the Hong Kong Single Parents Association.
“The supply of community nannies has already fallen short of demand, and what makes it worse is that there are fewer newcomers.”
The association runs the service in Sha Tin and has 56 nannies, and offers the nannies regular abuse prevention training."

After finally fulfilling his potential with five spectacular wins from his past six starts, Beauty Destiny will race on the Sha Tin turf for the first time since November 2023 in Sunday’s Class Two Hong Kong Jockey Club Community Trophy (1,200m).
The Frankie Lor Fu-chuen-trained gelding infamously started his career at the home of the city’s biggest races in 2023, going down as a $1.4 favourite on debut and $1.7 favourite second up when racing greenly and swishing his tail in running.
He could only manage 10th when resuming in November that year and finally broke through for his first victory later that season, scoring at the Valley under Zac Purton.

However, Beauty Destiny has returned this season a more mature horse, with his ability to settle early in his races and finish strongly in complete contrast to his early days of going too hard and fading.
He started his current streak off a mark of 51 and has soared to 95 thanks to two Class Four victories, a pair of Class Three wins and a Class Two success last start.
In-form jockey Andrea Atzeni, who has been aboard Beauty Destiny throughout his breakout campaign, hopes the five-year-old shows he isn’t just a Happy Valley specialist on Sunday.
“Hopefully the way we’ve been riding him lately, that’s what has helped him turn the corner rather than just racing at Happy Valley,” Azteni said.
“It’s hard to know how far he’s got to go still because every time he goes up a level or in the handicap, he just keeps turning up.
“He’s doing it quite well, too. He’s not just falling in, he’s been winning well. It was only a matter of time before he moved to Sha Tin because there aren’t many races for him at the Valley, so it will be interesting to see how he goes.
“I don’t think there will be any issues. If he gets luck in running, it’s a tight race but on what he’s been doing lately, it wouldn’t surprise me if he goes again. He’s a very good horse and lets hope he can go to another level.”
Beauty Destiny jumps from gate two in a solid Class Two sprint featuring Gorgeous Win and last-start winners Lady’s Choice and Kaholo Angel.
After surging to third in the jockeys’ premiership with a haul of recent winners, Atzeni hopes to continue his form when he also rides Island Breezes, Cheer For South, Ahren, Drala, Drombeg Banner, Gold Master and Ballistic Win on Sunday.
“I wish I had a better draw with Ahren because I really like the horse,” Atzeni said of the Ricky Yiu Poon-fai-trained gelding, who jumps from gate 12.
“It doesn’t make our job any easier, but hopefully there’s a bit of pace in the race and we can slot in somewhere and he’ll be hitting the line again.
“Drombeg Banner is a solid horse. It’s a good race, but he’s in with a light weight [115 pounds] and I can’t see any other pace in the race, so hopefully we should get a nice lead.
“Gold Master won quite cosily last start. He’s up in class with a light weight [120 pounds], but I like him a lot. He keeps improving.”"

In normal conditions, Canadian Air Force helicopter pilot Jonathan Vokey uses the tree line to gauge his altitude. But in the Arctic, where the landing zone is an expanse of white snow, he has to adjust.
“Operating in the cold, it’s hard on the body, but it also can be challenging with the aircraft as well,” Vokey, an Air Force captain, said during an exercise aimed at preparing Canadian troops to operate in the country’s extreme north, a region fast becoming a military priority.
Canada is making a significant push to boost its military strength in the Arctic, which accounts for 40 per cent of its territory.
Arctic ice is melting as a result of climate change, opening up the region and increasing the risk of confrontation with rivals such as Russia over the area’s natural resources, including minerals, oil and gas, as well as fresh water.
“If I was to boil it down: you can access the north now more easily than you have ever been able to. And I would say that that’s going to change even more drastically over the next 10, 20 years,” said Colonel Darren Turner, joint task force commander of Operation Nanook, the annual Arctic training exercise established in 2007."

Pacific Shuanglin Bio-pharmacy, Beijing Tiantan Biological Products and China Resources Boya Bio-pharmaceutical Group – involved in processing human blood plasma into high-value medical products – gained 10.6 to 16.6 per cent in two days after Beijing announced a matching 34 per cent “reciprocal” tariff imposed by Washington on Chinese goods.
Analysts attributed the three companies’ stand-out performance to the tariffs on US plasma products slapped by China, which relies on imports to meet demand. Blood proteins are the US’ top pharmaceutical exports to China and one of the largest chargeable items in public hospitals on the mainland, according to SWS Research, one of the largest securities research and consulting firms in China.
Albumin, which represents half of blood plasma’s total protein content, is used to treat trauma victims suffering from large blood loss, and acute kidney and liver disease. China’s demand for albumin reached 645 tonnes in 2021, 63 per cent of which was met by imports, according to a report by Insight and Info, a Beijing-based market research firm. Sales of the blood protein, which have been growing at an annual rate of 10.5 per cent since 2020, are projected to reach 42.5 billion yuan (US$5.8 billion) this year.
The main exporters of albumin from the US to China include CSL Behring, Grifols and Baxter."

Alphabet and Nvidia have joined prominent venture capital investors to back Safe Superintelligence (SSI), a start-up co-founded by OpenAI’s former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever that has quickly risen to become one of the most valuable artificial intelligence start-ups months after its launch, a source familiar with the matter has said.
The funding illustrates renewed interest from the big tech and infrastructure providers in making strategic investments in the start-ups developing cutting-edge AI that requires massive amounts of computing power. Alphabet, which has its own AI models, earlier in the week announced a deal by its cloud computing arm to sell SSI access to tensor processing units (TPUs), its in-house AI chips.
SSI, which sources say was recently valued at US$32 billion in a round led by Greenoaks, is one of the highest-profile start-ups working on AI model research, thanks to Sutskever’s stellar track record in predicting the next big thing in AI development.
Like many of its competitors, it has a huge demand for chips.
Reuters could not determine the exact terms of Alphabet’s and Nvidia’s investment in SSI. Spokespeople for all three companies declined to comment.
The twin moves by Alphabet’s corporate and cloud division with high-profile AI labs including SSI and Anthropic show the tech giant’s evolving AI hardware strategy."

Ask Alligator Jesus, who makes custom dental accessories for celebrities
Teeth, the only exposed part of our skeletons, have fascinated people throughout history. And dental fashion has long been a marker of status and beauty.
For thousands of years, starting around 3500BC, people of the ancient civilisations of Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley adorned their teeth with gold and gemstones to signal wealth and spiritual power.
In Japan, ohaguro or tooth blackening, done with an iron solution or plant extracts, was practised for centuries, mostly by women, and symbolised loyalty and maturity. It was banned by the country’s government in the late 19th century.
The European Renaissance that ran from the 14th to the 17th centuries embraced tooth filing, a process in which teeth were sharpened into points.
Whether gilded, sculpted or darkened, teeth have always been more than functional – they have been a canvas to show cultural identity, and a reflection of changing ideals of beauty and prestige.
Fast forward to the third millennium, and we have grillz, also known as grills. These dental accessories are usually made using precious or semi-precious stones encased in gold, and are custom moulded to fit your upper or lower jaw, or both, to make it appear as if your smile is made of these precious elements."

The 18-year-old told the Post that by the time he was six, he could name all the cars he saw on the streets of Shenzhen, the city neighbouring Hong Kong where he was raised.
Harnessing their child’s automobile obsession, Xie’s parents took him to a local karting track so he could complete a one-day course and get his racing licence. The driving school was hosting a competition two days later and asked Xie whether, despite his inexperience, he wanted to join.
“My dad was like, ‘Why not?’ because he saw I was having fun,” Xie said. “It was only a small local race, but I won, even though I had no idea what was going on.”
It was not the first sporting legacy Xie’s father gave his son: his English name comes from Xie Snr’s love for Liverpool FC and their former captain Steven Gerrard.

The Australian Hall of Fame trainer was tossing up whether to drop Rubylot back to the 1,600m of the Group One Champions Mile or pit him against world-class opposition, headlined by French star Goliath and Japan’s Liberty Island and Prognosis, in the QE II Cup.
A brilliant winner of the second leg of the four-year-old series, the Classic Cup (1,800m), Rubylot was a beaten favourite when fifth to Cap Ferrat in last month’s Derby but had an excuse when he was bumped by Noisy Boy several times.
“I think because he had been prepared for a Derby, we might as well try him against the best 2,000m horses,” Hayes said.

“If he measures up, great. But if he doesn’t measure up, he’ll be kept for shorter distances.”
Hayes made another crucial call when opting to start Rubylot in Sunday’s Class One Healthy Community Handicap (1,400m), rather than trial him at Sha Tin on Tuesday.
That decision paves the way for an audacious bid to drop back in trip three weeks after the Derby, before jumping back up to 10 furlongs two weeks later.
“We just thought rather than trial against Voyage Bubble for no money and he loves it wet – there’s a little bit of rain around – why not give him a warm-up race in this?” Hayes said.
“He’s won three races at 1,400m. I think he’s freshened up well and he’ll run a good race.
“Coming back from 2,000m in three weeks is never easy, but I gave him a bit of sprint work at the start of the week and he responded well.
“It might be a bit short but he’ll run really well. In the Derby he was bumped the whole way – he kept getting bumped, not interfered with but just put off. I think if we just get him in a rhythm and save him for one late run, he’ll fly home.”
With Rubylot dropping down towards the bottom of the weights with 119 pounds, lightweight jockey Karis Teetan has picked up the plum ride from the gelding’s regular rider Brenton Avdulla, who teams up with top weight Beauty Joy.
Dropping back from Group races for the first time since 2023, the Tony Cruz-trained Beauty Joy rarely visits the winners’ enclosure but also consistently performs above expectations, including a third behind Voyage Bubble in the Group One Hong Kong Mile in December.
The strongest race on Sunday’s card also includes last year’s Group One Chairman’s Sprint Prize (1,200m) victor Invincible Sage, Group Three winners Patch Of Theta, Mugen and Taj Dragon, as well as Drombeg Banner, Mr Ascendency and Classic Mile runner-up Divano.
Sitting second on the trainers’ championship with 41 wins this term, Hayes will also be represented by Ka Ying Resilience, Falcon Court, Honest Witness, Positive Smile, Night Purosangue and Ariel on Sunday.
Honest Witness looks capable of improving second up in the Class Four JC Campsite Reimagination Project Handicap (1,200m) after a solid debut fourth to Super Strong Kid down the 1,000m straight.

Meanwhile, Lesotho, Madagascar, Botswana, Angola and South Africa have been hardest hit in sub-Saharan Africa by Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs that range from 10 per cent to 50 per cent.
Kai Xue, a Beijing-based corporate lawyer who advises on foreign direct investment and cross-border financing, said resource-rich South Africa and a few countries that have developed clothing manufacturing industries under the US African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) – such as Kenya, Ethiopia, Mauritius and Lesotho – could be seriously affected.
“South Africa, with a diverse set of exports amounting to around US$8 billion annually to the US, is likely to be hammered if the tariffs are not rescinded,” Xue said."

Argentina sealed a US$20 billion, 48-month extended fund facility deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday and, in a major policy move ahead of the deal, dismantled key parts of its years-long currency controls and loosened its grip on the peso.
The IMF will disburse US$12 billion by next Tuesday, while another US$2 billion will become available by June.
The deal is expected to help Argentina “catalyse additional official multilateral and bilateral support, and a timely re-access to international capital markets”, the IMF said.
“Key pillars of the programme include maintaining a strong fiscal anchor, transitioning towards a more robust monetary and FX regime, with greater exchange rate flexibility,” it added in a statement.
Earlier, the South American nation’s central bank announced it would undo a fixed currency peg from Monday, letting the peso freely fluctuate within a moving band between 1,000 pesos and 1,400 pesos per dollar, versus 1,074 at the close on Friday.
Argentina would eliminate major parts of the so-called cepo capital controls that had restricted access to foreign currency, the central bank said in a statement.

Hundreds of supporters lined the streets near South Korea’s presidential residence on Friday evening, chanting “Yoon again” and waving South Korean and American flags as former president Yoon Suk-yeol and first lady Kim Keon-hee departed following his impeachment a week earlier.
“Fraudulent impeachment! Null and void!” the crowd shouted, as Yoon hugged younger supporters, shook hands and exited the grounds shortly after 5pm local time. He waved to the crowd and raised a clenched fist before leaving.
The couple returned to their private home in southern Seoul, exactly one week after the Constitutional Court unanimously upheld Yoon’s impeachment over his attempt to impose martial law in December – a move it ruled unconstitutional and based on unsubstantiated claims of election interference by China and North Korea.
Yet for Yoon’s core supporters – many of them older, deeply conservative and staunchly anti-communist – the ruling only deepened mistrust towards the judiciary, the opposition and even members of his own People Power Party.
Seventy-year-old retiree Moon Keun-chan echoed a common refrain: that Yoon’s downfall was not just a political misstep, but also a setback in the country’s battle against communism."

One reporter’s weight-loss journey and what a ‘healthy body’ means to him
I remember the day in July of last year. The excitement of an approaching three-week European trip bubbled as I bought a pair of running shoes and put them on.
But, looking down, I could not see my new footwear. My tummy was in the way.
In Spain, weeks later, I was walking up a gentle ramp in Toledo when it began to feel like I was struggling up a mountain. My lungs burned, my heart pounded and I needed to stop.
I had to admit to myself that through my off-and-on attempts to keep fit over eight years, I was overweight, eating too much and not healthy.
I had ballooned to 98kg (216lbs), my heaviest ever and 23kg above the ideal weight of 75kg for a man of my height.
It was no consolation that I was among the majority in Hong Kong, where 54.6 per cent of the adult population is considered overweight or obese, according to the Department of Health’s 2020-2022 Population Health Survey."

A man in China who scratched his lottery tickets while kowtowing to ancestors at their tombs has scooped the biggest win of his life and attributed his luck to the “blessings” of his forebears
The 25-year-old, from southern China’s Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, said he spent 600 yuan (US$80) on 60 lottery scratch cards, and took them to his ancestors’ tomb during the just passed grave-sweeping festival.
Thinking his ancestors would bless him, he scratched all 60 cards at their tomb. To his surprise, he soon scratched out a 4,000-yuan (US$550) reward on one card.
The man said he immediately gave four more kowtows to his ancestors, continued scratching the same card, and won a total of 10,000 yuan (US$1,400).
He said that he had almost never won lotteries or prizes, and this was his biggest win ever.
He posted photos of the lottery tickets on social media and said: “Thank you ancestors”."

Tucked away in sleepy Perlis, Malaysia’s tiniest state, an ambitious infrastructure project is quietly taking shape.
Most of the Malaysians I know have never visited Perlis. The mostly agricultural state in the far north of the Malay Peninsula shares a land border with Thailand and is better known for its rice fields. Those who have visited travelled through it in passing on their way to southern Thailand.
The entire state is smaller than Hong Kong in geographical size, and its population is just under 300,000.
The timing of the Perlis Inland Port could not be more apt, though. With traditional shipping routes endangered by ongoing wars and potential flashpoints, people are starting to look at rail again as a viable alternative for moving goods across continents.
Of course, turning that vision into reality is another matter altogether."

Hong Kong’s sporting bodies should be run in the unforgiving image of big business, according to Andrew Wright, the city’s triathlon head coach.
Triathlon’s Tier A status means its athletes receive between HK$35,450 (US$4,600) and HK$41,740 per month from Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI), funded by the taxpayer.
Wright, though, insisted on raising the minimum benchmarks needed for his athletes to keep that support this year, having decided the previous yardsticks were “substandard”.
“These sports need to be run like big businesses,” Wright said. “If you were working for HSBC and not performing, the same would happen.
“It’s doing an athlete a favour, because [not reaching benchmarks] shows triathlon is not what they should be doing with their time. It’s fair to them, and it’s fair for everyone else.”

US President Donald Trump is waiting for Beijing “to make the first move” to initiate tariff negotiations and believes it “would be gracious if China intends to make a deal with the United States”, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Friday.
Earlier in the day, Beijing announced it was raising tariffs on all US imports to 125 per cent, from 84 per cent, in response to Trump’s move on Wednesday increasing levies on Chinese imports to 145 per cent.
But Leavitt warned that adopting retaliatory measures “would not be good for China”.
The press secretary’s comments cap off a week of on-again-off-again moves in an unprecedented trade war – triggering equally abrupt stock market swings – as Trump tries to reset a bilateral trade relationship characterised for decades by surpluses in China’s favour.
Stocks closed up on Friday, regaining some of what they lost on Thursday, as Wall Street finished a historic week of immense swings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 619 points, or 1.5 per cent; the S&P 500 advanced 1.8 per cent; and the Nasdaq recovered slightly more than 2 per cent.
Beijing seemed up for a war of words. Earlier on Friday, a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman said that Trump’s tariffs action “has become a numbers game, which has no practical economic significance”, and was destined to become “a joke in the history of the world economy”."

Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil can be deported as a national security risk, an immigration judge in Louisiana has ruled during a hearing over the legality of kicking the activist who took part in pro-Palestinian demonstrations out of the US.
Immigration Judge Jamee E. Comans said on Friday at the conclusion of a hearing in Jena that the government’s contention that Khalil’s presence in the United States posed “potentially serious foreign policy consequences” was enough to satisfy requirements for his deportation.
Comans said the government had “established by clear and convincing evidence that he is removable”.
Lawyers for Khalil are expected to appeal. And a federal judge in New Jersey has temporarily barred Khalil’s removal from the country.
Khalil, a legal US resident, was detained by federal immigration agents on March 8 in the lobby of his university-owned flat, the first arrest under US President Donald Trump’s promised crackdown on students who joined campus protests against the war in Gaza.
Within a day, he was flown across the country and taken to an immigration detention centre in Jena, thousands of kilometres from his lawyers and wife, a US citizen who is due to give birth soon."

Doctors have had to remove the pig kidney implanted in an American woman after her body rejected it, but her four months living with the animal’s organ set a record, the hospital that performed the operation said Friday.
Towana Looney, a woman in her fifties from the southern state of Alabama, had received the genetically modified pig kidney on November 25 in New York.
The highly experimental procedure had fuelled optimism that animal kidneys might prove a usable source amid a chronic shortage of available human kidneys.
Her body’s eventual rejection of the transplant showed that the reliable use of animal organs remains a distant goal, but doctors took some hope since the pig kidney did its blood-filtering work for 130 days before the body began rejecting it.
A handful of patients had previously received pig kidneys, but none had survived more than two months.
Doctors said Looney, who is again receiving dialysis treatment, remains a candidate to receive a human kidney if one becomes available."

The UK government has called an emergency weekend session of parliament to pass legislation aimed at saving the country’s last factory that makes steel from raw materials, a move that has been widely called for since US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on imported steel.
Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office on Friday said in a statement that lawmakers were being asked to return on Saturday from their Easter break to debate legislation that would effectively see British Steel and its plant in the north of England town of Scunthorpe taken back into public ownership, in the near-term at least.
“The bill provides the government with the power to direct steel companies in England, which we will use to protect the Scunthorpe site,” it said. “It enables the UK government to preserve capability and ensure public safety.”
Though the term “nationalisation” was not used, it is clear that Starmer’s centre-left government will take over the day-to-day running of British Steel from Jingye Group, the company’s Chinese owner since 2020.
Jingye has said the Scunthorpe plant is financially unsustainable due to “challenging market conditions”, tariffs and increased environmental costs.
Trump’s decision last month to slap a 25 per cent tariff on all imported steel and aluminium has weighed on the prospects of British Steel. Though Starmer voiced disappointment at the tariffs imposed, he has not retaliated and is seeking to negotiate the tariffs away."

Ni Hong, minister of housing and urban-rural development, laid out some of the standards in a briefing on Sunday, including a minimum ceiling height of 3 metres for all residential property, up from 2.8 metres previously. He added that “new technologies” should be used to address issues such as sound insulation and odours, and that homes should be available in different sizes and price ranges to meet diverse needs.
Affordable housing and redevelopment of old homes would be top priorities, he said.
“Since most new homes now come with fully finished interiors, the actual usable ceiling height is reduced,” said Lu Wenxi, an analyst at Centaline Property. “After accounting for flooring and other finishes, the net height can end up around 2.6 metres, which can feel quite cramped.”
Future projects were likely to follow the guidelines, enhancing quality of life and promoting higher construction standards for residential buildings, he said, adding that the measures would help boost sales.
“The guidance is in line with Fitch’s expectation that a greater portion of [future] housing demand will come from homebuyers looking to upgrade their homes,” said Shi Lulu, director of Asia-Pacific corporate ratings at Fitch Ratings. “This shift in demand structure is likely to support the overall average selling price for new homes, as these properties tend to be of higher quality and thus command higher prices.”"

A former Russian government minister who violated British sanctions by receiving significant financial support from family members was sentenced Friday to more than three years in prison.
Dmitrii Ovsiannikov, who was appointed governor of Sevastopol in Crimea by Russian President Vladimir Putin, became the first person convicted of violating the sanctions put in place after the illegal annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.
He set up a British bank account to illegally receive tens of thousands of pounds from his wife and accepted gifts and payments from his brother, prosecutors said.
Ovsiannikov, 48, was convicted on Wednesday in London’s Southwark Crown Court of six counts of circumventing sanctions between February 2023 and January 2024, and two counts of money laundering. He was sentenced to 40 months behind bars.
Ovsiannikov, who also served as deputy minister for industry and trade, was an important political figure placed under European Union sanctions in 2017 for work that threatened the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, prosecutors said.
The sanctions prevented him from depositing or withdrawing funds in EU countries. Although the EU sanctions were annulled by the Court of Justice of the EU in 2022, they remained in place in the UK under the Russian Regulations adopted in 2019 as it left the bloc."

An Australian judge has resigned from Hong Kong’s top court, becoming the sixth foreign member to step down over the past year, telling the Post on Friday he had observed that the role of non-permanent justices had “become increasingly anachronistic and arguably cosmetic”.
Justice Robert French, a non-permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal since 2017, revealed that he had tendered his resignation on March 31. The judge, 78, stressed that he maintained his “respect for the Hong Kong and international members of the court and their integrity and independence”.
The judiciary announced French’s resignation earlier on Friday while the government said the presence or absence of individual judges would not undermine the integrity of the judicial system.
French said he would not be making any statement about the national security laws and associated practices but “there will no doubt be future cases in which their interpretation and application will come before the court”."

Children including toddlers represent more than a third of victims in nearly 10,000 cases of rape and other forms of sexual violence committed in eastern Congo in the first two months of the year, the UN children’s agency said on Friday.
The Congolese Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group seized parts of eastern Congo earlier this year as part of a rapid offensive that left thousands dead, including children, and forced hundreds of thousands from their homes.
Unicef spokesperson James Elder told a Geneva press briefing that the rapes and other forms of sexual violence were being used as “a weapon of war” and were taking place once every 30 minutes on average, with toddlers also among the victims.
“We are not talking about isolated incidents, we are talking about a systemic crisis,” he said, citing a database collected by organisations on the ground working on sexual violence which showed that between 35-45 per cent of the total were under-18s.
“It is a weapon of war and a deliberate tactic of terror.”
Elder, who spoke via video link from Goma, said that funding shortages were affecting the ability to treat survivors of sexual attacks."

World leaders and diplomats at the Antalya Diplomacy Forum in Turkey have called for greater inclusion of the Global South in global decision-making, warning that deepening geopolitical fractures and economic rivalries are weakening international cooperation and imperilling peace.
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, China’s special envoy for Middle East affairs Zhai Jun, UN General Assembly President Philemon Yang and several other heads of state spoke at the forum on Friday, held under the theme “Reclaiming Diplomacy in a Fragmented World”.
The gathering came against the backdrop of escalating geopolitical tensions, including the trade war between the United States and China, as well as the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine.
“It is critical to have more bilateral diplomacy and regional diplomacy and prepare the ground for a new world order,” Cevdet Yilmaz, Turkey’s vice-president told the meeting, noting that economic rivalry is emerging as a more germane problem for the world than military challenges.
“This recent tariff war is a very clear point to underline the discussions,” he said.
China raised its tariffs on US products to 125 per cent, hitting back against US President Donald Trump’s decision to hike duties on Chinese goods to 145 per cent in a trade war that threatens to disrupt global supply chains.

A Hong Kong court has invalidated a 2004 will by late tycoon Lim Por-yen, ruling his third wife and children are also entitled to inherit part of his estate.
The High Court on Friday found there were “highly suspicious circumstances” surrounding Lim’s execution of the December 2004 will, in which he purportedly bequeathed most of his assets to the wives and children from his first two marriages.
His estate was valued at HK$2.9 billion (US$373.68 million) at the time of his death, according to the plaintiff.
The court held that Lim could not have had the mental capacity required to make a new will revoking one he proclaimed to be his last in 1973.
The court ruled in favour of art dealer Pearl Ling Meng-chu, also known as Pearl Lam, and her mother Koo Siu-ying, who were excluded from the list of beneficiaries in the 2004 document."

India was among seven possible bidders wanting to host the 2031 Asian Cup, the Asian Football Confederation said on Friday, as its top official hailed the highest expression of interest in the tournament’s history.
The other federations registering interest were Australia, Indonesia, Kuwait, South Korea – which has never hosted the tournament launched in 1956 – United Arab Emirates and a joint project between Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
Officials said a decision on hosting the 24-team tournament was scheduled for next year at its annual congress.
Shaikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, the AFC president, said the last event in Qatar had proved the cup was “undoubtedly one of the greatest success stories” and cemented it as “one of the best football competitions in the world”.
“The record number of bids that we have received is further testament to the stature and appeal of the AFC Asian Cup and on behalf of the AFC Executive Committee, I would like to put on record our sincere appreciation to all our member associations for outlining their ambition to extend and expand on our proud legacy,” he added.
Australia hosted and won the Asian Cup in 2015. The UAE hosted in 2019, starting a run of three straight editions in the Gulf. Qatar hosted the most recent edition and Saudi Arabia has the 2027 Asian Cup, where Qatar will be the two-time defending champions."

Beijing and Washington have engaged in a rapid tit-for-tat exchange over the past two weeks, with each side raising tariffs on each other’s products again and again as the confrontation between the world’s two largest economies rapidly escalates.
But the latest duties only represent part of the total levies China’s goods now face in the United States. Below is a breakdown of the current tariff burden, and what that means for the future of US-China trade.
US President Donald Trump has raised tariffs on Chinese imports by a combined 145 per cent since taking office in January.
That includes so-called “reciprocal” duties of 125 per cent, plus two rounds of 10 per cent tariff hikes that were introduced before the current tit-for-tat exchange began – which Washington justified by pointing to China’s supposed role in the fentanyl trade.
But Chinese goods are also subject to tariffs that were introduced before Trump’s second term began. By the Post’s calculation, that brings the total tariff burden to about 156 per cent.
Meanwhile, Beijing has mirrored Washington’s moves, raising duties on US imports by a total of 125 per cent over the past two weeks. That figure does not include any additional tariffs applied before the current trade war began."

Health screenings at Hong Kong’s border control points must be maintained to identify early threats of infectious diseases, authorities have said, after lawmakers questioned the need to spend more than HK$200 million (US$25.77 million) on such measures annually when the Covid-19 pandemic was over.
Director of Health Dr Ronald Lam Man-kin insisted on Friday that the screenings, which included monitoring the body temperature of arrivals, at the city’s 13 border control points was necessary.
“To prevent the import of infectious diseases to Hong Kong, health screenings at the airport and other border control points are very important to help identify the risks,” Lam told a Legislative Council meeting. “Hong Kong must safeguard the southern gateway of China.”
Even a single patient could become a disease superspreader, he cautioned.
Lawmakers questioned whether the HK$205 million spent on health screenings in the past financial year was excessive. Last year, 4,214 travellers with a fever were identified by the system, while another six who fulfilled the reporting criteria of a major infectious disease were referred to public hospitals for further check-ups.
“As the global epidemic situation has become stable and our resources are rather tight, would authorities consider cancelling or scaling down the screening work, and use the resources on areas that are in greater need?” Chan Pui-leung, from the Election Committee constituency, said."

US President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff held talks with President Vladimir Putin on Friday in St Petersburg about the search for a peace deal on Ukraine as Trump told Russia to “get moving”.
Putin was shown on state television greeting Witkoff in St Petersburg’s presidential library at the start of the negotiations and state news agencies later said the talks lasted more than four hours.
“The theme of the meeting – aspects of a Ukrainian settlement,” the Kremlin said in a statement after the meeting concluded.
Witkoff has emerged as a key figure in the on-off rapprochement between Moscow and Washington amid talk on the Russian side of potential joint investments in the Arctic and in Russian rare earth minerals.
The Izvestia news outlet earlier released video of Witkoff leaving a hotel in the city, accompanied by Kirill Dmitriev, Putin’s investment envoy. Dmitriev called the talks on Friday productive, according to Russian state news agency TASS.
However, the talks come at a time when US-Russia dialogue aimed at agreeing on a ceasefire ahead of a possible peace deal to end the war in Ukraine appears to have stalled over disagreements around conditions for a full pause in hostilities."

The women, aged 24 and 33, were arrested by undercover officers posing as customers in two separate cases in as many days.
Police said on Friday that the pair were accused of failing to hold valid certificates to practise as dentists.
The 33-year-old woman, surnamed Tsoi, was allegedly taking digital impressions with an intra-oral scanner and prescribing clear aligners in an orthodontic centre in a commercial building on Canton Road in Tsim Sha Tsui. She was arrested on Thursday.
The force had received a complaint in February from a client who suspected that her dentist was unlicensed.
“Police sent an undercover officer as a customer and cracked down on an orthodontic clinic run by an unlicensed dentist,” said Senior Inspector Sit Ka-wing, of the miscellaneous inquiries subunit in Tsim Sha Tsui."

Several US-listed mainland Chinese companies have reached out to the Hong Kong government amid the escalating trade war, the city’s innovation minister has said, while calling for the financial hub to seize opportunities created by the crisis to showcase its international appeal.
Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong weighed in on the intensifying US-China tensions on Friday, the same day Beijing increased tariffs on US imports to 125 per cent in retaliation for Washington’s decision to raise duties on Chinese goods to 145 per cent.
During a special Finance Committee meeting of the Legislative Council, lawmaker Elizabeth Quat Pei-fan asked the government to try to attract Chinese-American tech talent and US-listed Chinese firms that were seeking to leave the North American country amid the trade war.
“[The government] could consider building a green lane to facilitate the listing of high-quality Chinese tech firms in Hong Kong. This can boost Hong Kong’s stock market while advancing Hong Kong’s tech development,” Quat said.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly declined to rule out the possibility that Washington might delist Chinese stocks from US exchanges, saying that the decision would rest with American President Trump. He also warned Beijing against trying to devalue its currency as a way to respond to the new tariffs.
In response to the lawmaker, Sun said: “In reality, there are quite a few mainland companies listed on the Nasdaq that have recently reached out to us through different means. In this time, Hong Kong must leverage its unique advantages – freedom, openness and internationalism."

A woman in Australia unknowingly gave birth to a stranger’s baby after she received another patient’s embryo from her in vitro fertilisation clinic due to “human error”, the clinic said.
The mix-up was discovered in February when the clinic in the city of Brisbane found that the birth parents had one too many embryos in storage, said the provider, Monash IVF, in a statement on Friday.
Staff discovered an embryo from another patient had been mistakenly thawed and transferred to the birth mother, a spokesperson said.
Australia news outlets reported the baby was born in 2024. Monash IVF did not confirm how old the child was.
The company, one of Australia’s biggest IVF providers, said an initial investigation had not uncovered any other such errors. Its statement did not identify the patients involved or divulge details about the child’s custody.
“All of us at Monash IVF are devastated and we apologise to everyone involved,” said CEO Michael Knaap. “We will continue to support the patients through this extremely distressing time.”"

Authorities will carry out real-time flood monitoring of five low-lying road sections hit by record-breaking rainfall in Hong Kong two years ago and temporarily close them if water levels reach 0.3 metres in the coming rainy season.
The government on Friday announced a HK$700,000 (US$89,745) pilot scheme to place warning signs, paint wading lines and install flood monitoring devices at low-lying sections of Chai Wan Road on Hong Kong Island, Lung Cheung Road, Tsui Ping Road and Chatham Road North in Kowloon, and Nam Wan Road in Tai Po.
Under the plan, when the water level reaches the warning level – 0.1 metres from the lowest point of the road – the monitoring device will alert the relevant departments, which will send workers to inspect and clear drains. Generally, they will arrive within 15 to 30 minutes.
When the water reaches the wading line, which will be painted in red to indicate a depth of 0.3 metres, authorities will close off the road section to prevent vehicles from entering the area.
A government spokesman said the threshold was set at 0.3 metres as car exhaust pipes and electric vehicle batteries were located at around that level.
“If vehicles drive into water with a depth of 0.3 metres, there is a high possibility of damage. If the vehicle stalls and the water continues to rise under heavy rain, it will be worrying,” he said."

Sharing a stage with Manchester United can motivate Hong Kong’s players, but it is not the ultimate test, according to coach Ashley Westwood – the AFC Asian Cup qualifier against India days later has that billing.
After months of speculation, it was confirmed this week that 20-time Premier League champions United will play the city team at Hong Kong Stadium on May 30.
Westwood said the match would raise the curtain on an “important and intense period”, with Hong Kong facing Nepal in a friendly on June 5, five days before the “ultimate game” against India.
He said there was a “strong possibility” of his team making their Kai Tak Stadium debut for the latter fixture. The Post has been told the Nepal clash was likely to happen at Mong Kok Stadium.
Englishman Westwood is expecting it to be “easy to motivate players” to tackle United, where he was an academy player, although the job of whittling down his squad to 23 or 24 members was growing tougher.
“We’re getting stronger, our preliminary squads are getting bigger and there are more decisions for me to make,” Westwood said."

The state-backed China Semiconductor Industry Association (CSIA) informed its members on Friday, citing customs regulations, that the place of origin for chips is determined by the location of wafer fabrication – a key process in the chip supply chain alongside chip design, packaging and testing. Regardless of whether the chips are packaged or unpackaged, IC products should declare the wafer fabrication facility’s location as the origin when reporting imports, according to the notice.
The change has implications for the US semiconductor industry. The rule from China, the world’s largest IC market, could increase the cost of chips from fabs on American soil, which could persuade fabs to set up facilities outside the US, according to a research note by ICWise, a Shanghai-based consultancy.
The research note argued that Trump’s tariffs would fail to achieve the goal of “making America great again”, as they would instead only “make America outsource again”.
The change comes amid an escalating tariff war between the US and China. China’s Ministry of Finance announced that it would increase tariffs on US products to 125 per cent from 84 per cent, effective on Saturday, to match Trump’s tariffs."

But the Trump administration remains focused on countering China, with the document ordering the Office of the US Trade Representative to consider proposing tariffs on ship-to-shore cranes and other cargo-handling equipment with links to China.

Donald Trump had his annual physical on Friday, a check-up that may give the public its first details in years about the health of a man who, in January, became the oldest in US history to be sworn in as president.
“I have never felt better, but nevertheless, these things must be done!” Trump, 78, posted on his social media site ahead of the examination, which was conducted at Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre in Bethesda, Maryland.
How long the exam took was not immediately clear as Trump did not speak to reporters before or after it. All told, however, he spent more than five hours at the centre before heading to Air Force One and flying to Florida for the weekend.
Despite long questioning predecessor Joe Biden’s physical and mental capacity, Trump has routinely kept basic facts about his own health shrouded in secrecy – shying away from traditional presidential transparency on medical issues. If history is any indication, his latest physical is likely to produce a flattering report that is scarce on details.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at the White House while Trump was still being examined that the president was undergoing his “routine and long-scheduled physical”.
She promised a readout from the White House doctor that would be released “as soon as we possibly can” and suggested it would be comprehensive."

A winning bidder last month paid HK$180,000 (US$23,210) for the Arena Bishamon Carbon Glide suit and Hong Kong team cap worn by Haughey in Tokyo when she claimed the city’s first Olympic medal in swimming, storming to silver in the 200 metres freestyle on July 28, 2021.
She went on to add silver in the 100m freestyle in Tokyo, then bronze in both events in the Paris Games last year."

Malaysian whistle-blowers need stronger legal protections, a watchdog said on Friday, following a controversy in which a businessman who exposed alleged corruption in Sabah state was publicly admonished by the country’s anti-graft body for going public with his claims.
Albert Tei, a businessman based in Sabah, covertly filmed videos that allegedly show senior state politicians soliciting and accepting bribes.
The footage soon went viral, prompting denials from the politicians involved, who accused Tei of releasing the videos as an act of retaliation for not receiving certain government contracts.
But on Thursday, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) announced that Tei did not qualify for legal protection under the Whistleblower Protection Act because he went public with his allegations before formally filing a complaint with the agency."

The incident, which unfolded during a short address at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City on Wednesday, was caught in a five-minute video posted by the presidential palace and state broadcaster RTVM. From around the 1:38 mark, blood is clearly visible near the lower right side of the president’s mouth.
Some users speculated that Marcos, 66, was showing symptoms of kidney disease – the same illness that afflicted his father and namesake, the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos Snr, who required multiple transplants in the 1980s.
Bleeding gums can be a symptom of chronic kidney disease, as poor kidney function can affect blood clotting and lead to gum inflammation. However, it is more commonly caused by issues like gingivitis or poor oral hygiene."

Hong Kong is likely to benefit from the delisting of mainland Chinese firms from American exchanges should the US follow up on its threat to eject them, according to bankers and analysts.
“These companies may consider a secondary listing or a dual-primary listing in Hong Kong to raise funds, which will boost the initial public offering (IPO) market,” said Tom Chan Pak-lam, honorary ­president of the Institute of Securities Dealers, an industry body for stockbrokers.
A total of 286 Chinese companies were listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and NYSE American with a combined market capitalisation of US$1.1 trillion at the end of March, according to data from these exchanges.
Since January 2024, 48 mainland firms have listed on the three US bourses, raising a combined US$2.1 billion, including self-driving car firm Pony.ai and Geely’s EV unit Zeekr.

Sweeping tariffs on imports imposed by US President Donald Trump and countermeasures could have a “catastrophic” impact on developing countries, hitting even harder than foreign aid cuts, the director of the United Nations trade agency said on Friday.
Global trade could shrink by three-seven per cent and global gross domestic product by 0.7 per cent, with developing countries the worst affected, the International Trade Centre said.
“It is huge,” said Pamela Coke-Hamilton, executive director of the International Trade Centre (ITC). “If this escalation between China and the US continues it will result in an 80 per cent reduction in trade between the countries, and the ripple effect of that across the board can be catastrophic.”
Global markets remained in turmoil on Friday. Trump this week announced a 90-day tariff pause on dozens of countries but hiked the duties on Chinese goods to an effective rate of 145 per cent.

Few actresses embody the cultural zeitgeist of 1990s Hong Kong quite like Carman Lee Yeuk-tung.
Her portrayal of the ethereal, sword-wielding nun who possesses qualities of loyalty and independence and an unbreakable spirit despite personal trauma was lauded by the author himself as the embodiment of the character he created. Now, 30 years later, she is still regarded by many as the best casting of a Cha heroine.

The owner of a 1.4 million yuan (US$190,000) Range Rover in China who sought compensation in the form of just 15 egg pancakes after a breakfast cart accidentally scratched his car has earned widespread praise on mainland social media.
The owner, surnamed Yang, from Shenyang, Liaoning province in northeastern China, said that his vehicle was recently scratched when a breakfast cart operated by a couple reversed into it.
“The cart was driven by the wife. She probably misjudged the distance and scraped my car,” Yang told the Yangtse Evening Post.
“She did not recognise what kind of car it was, and just called her husband over.”
After the incident, Yang contacted the car showroom and discovered that the repairs would cost about 3,000 yuan (US$410).
However, the male owner of the cart, surnamed Jiang, said they could not afford the repair costs."

Shanghai-based Chagee said it would “proceed as planned” with its Nasdaq IPO and had no intention to consider Hong Kong or other listing destinations, a spokesperson said.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent earlier this week said “everything is on the table” regarding the possibility of Washington delisting Chinese companies from American stock exchanges as part of its trade negotiations, adding that it was up to the US president to decide.

But to maintain his rise, Wong believes he needs to show progress on clay courts, during the annual run of tournaments played on the surface. He could be handed his first chance to do so in Madrid.
“We have to go to clay in the long run,” world No 173 Wong told the Post as he reflected on his run in Miami. “If you want to be a top player, you can’t skip clay and play just hard courts.”

A former Hong Kong police officer is facing 30 counts of bribery and fraud after he was previously charged by the city’s anti-corruption agency with accepting an unauthorised loan from someone linked to an investigation.
Magistrate Frances Leung Nga-yan on Friday approved an application by prosecutors to charge 50-year-old Mak Kwok-hung with the extra counts upon receipt of further legal advice from the Department of Justice.
The defendant is a former member of the Central police district’s investigation team.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said the extra charges included a count of accepting an advantage as a public servant, one count of an agent using a document with intent to deceive his principal and 28 counts of fraud.
One of the charges involved allegations that Mak, as a police constable at the time, had accepted a bribe of HK$100,000 (US$12,900) between July 2021 and August 2023 from an investment scam victim for providing help and internal information, it said.
Twenty-eight of the charges allege that the defendant had not disclosed his outstanding debts to the Hong Kong Police Credit Union and 13 financial institutions between December 2017 and April 2023."

The Philippines has successfully carried out its seventh resupply mission to a military outpost on the disputed Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea without Chinese interference, but analysts warn this could just be a false dawn for Manila.
One observer notes the trouble-free mission could be due to the arrangement between both sides that was reached in July 2024, and was reaffirmed during a subsequent bilateral meeting.
On Wednesday, the Armed Forces of the Philippines said in a statement its regular RORE (routine troop rotation and resupply), carried out in close coordination with the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), concluded without any untoward incident.
“As the nation marks the 83rd anniversary of the Day of Valor, the [armed forces] honours the courage and dedication of our soldiers aboard BRP Sierra Madre who continue to stand guard yesterday in the West Philippine Sea to uphold our sovereignty, sovereign rights and national interest,” the armed forces said.
The Chinese coastguard has tried to disrupt previous missions, accusing the Philippines of bringing building materials to reinforce the BRP Sierra Madre, a war wreck beached on the Second Thomas Shoal as an outpost for Manila."

Reports of deepfake-related digital sex crimes in South Korea more than tripled in 2024, driven by the rapid development and increasing accessibility of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.
The Digital Sex Crime Victim Support Centre received 1,384 reports of manipulated images used in digital sex crimes last year.
This marked a sharp increase compared to the 423 reports in 2023, according to data released on Thursday by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family and the Women’s Human Rights Institute of Korea.
Young people, specifically those in their teens or twenties, represented the overwhelming majority of deepfake victims, accounting for 92.6 per cent of cases.
Park Sung-hye, who leads deletion support at the advocacy centre, highlighted a disturbing trend of young people using AI-generated deepfake images for entertainment, The Korea Times reported.
“We’re seeing a growing number of reports involving elementary school students because of how easily accessible AI tools have become, even for children under the age of 10,” Park said, according to the Korea JoongAng Daily.
She added that young perpetrators would sometimes use photos of people they knew, such as friends or even teachers."

Beyond this milestone lies a deeper, less discussed breakthrough: BYD may have outpaced Tesla in sales, but the more interesting shift is how it’s beginning to play the long game of brand-building.
That means something more than exporting cutting-edge products. It means exporting ideas, identities and stories that emotionally resonate with audiences far beyond China’s borders. In other words, success will no longer be measured solely in units sold or patents filed but in the kind of narratives being told and whether they spark a connection.
BYD’s transformation is subtle but significant. Once known mostly for low-cost electric vehicles, it has evolved into a brand with a clear lifestyle focus. Its cars now come with globally appealing names like Dolphin and Seal, and its marketing has shifted from technical specs to emotional experiences. The message is no longer just “we’re good at making EVs”. It’s “we understand how you want to feel in the future of mobility”."

China announced on Friday that it will raise tariffs on American goods to 125 per cent from its previous rate of 84 per cent, matching the level announced by the Trump administration on Thursday.
Beijing will “simply ignore” any further tariff escalations from the US in the future, if Washington “persists with its tariff number games,” according to a statement from the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council, China’s cabinet.
At current duty rates, American goods exported to China already have no market viability, the commission said.
“Even if the US further raises tariffs to even higher levels, it would be economically meaningless and would ultimately become a laughingstock in the history of global economics,” it added.
“However, should the US insist on continuing to substantially harm China’s interests, China will resolutely institute countermeasures and see them through to the end.”
After a series of back-and-forth tariff salvoes, as it stands, Washington has imposed a 145 per cent duty on Chinese imports this year, bringing the effective rate to about 156 per cent. Meanwhile, Beijing’s new levies on US goods have risen to 125 per cent, also on top of previous tariffs."

Chinese retail investors who have seen this month’s tit-for-tat trade war wipe trillions of yuan from the value of the stock market are rushing to ask companies to disclose their business exposure in the United States.
Their anxiety spread on official investor relations platforms and in online communities, with questions directed to Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed firms about the exact impact of the trade war on company finances and proposed remedial measures.
“Just how much are the tariffs affecting the company? It’s time for the board secretary to speak up,” an investor said on Eastmoney Guba, a popular online community for small investors.
“Has the Thailand factory started mass production? What’s the share of the US market coming from Thailand versus China? These are the questions shareholders care about most!”

Public companies often reveal location-based revenue and overseas investment projects in quarterly, interim and annual reports.

Hong Kong should improve transport services and infrastructure at an internationally recognised geopark, lawmakers said on Friday, as the site’s popularity triggered concerns over illegal taxi charges and dangerous climbs by visitors.
The city’s tourism minister had on Thursday cautioned against building more infrastructure at the High Island Reservoir East Dam, which is part of the city’s Unesco Global Geopark in Sai Kung East, because of the potentially harmful impact on the environment.
The wider location has become a popular hotspot for visitors and is promoted on various mainland Chinese social media platforms.
Images posted online showed hundreds of visitors waiting at the geopark to get minibuses during public holidays.
“The site is located in a restricted area where visitors can only walk, or take minibuses or taxis to reach the location, which may result in many people waiting to leave in the evening,” lawmaker Stanley Li Sai-wing told a radio programme on Friday.
“I hope minibus operators can extend their service hours to handle the long queue of visitors.”"

Because of its name, I used to think allspice was a mixture akin to five-spice, ras el hanout, quatre epices and shichimi. It does actually taste somewhat like a blend of strong, aromatic spices such as clove, cinnamon, nutmeg and peppercorns.
The fruit of a type of myrtle shrub, allspice is important in Caribbean cuisines, especially that of Jamaica, which grows much of the world’s supply and where it is used in the spice mixture for jerk-style barbecued meats.
In aromatherapy, allspice essential oil is believed to be an aphrodisiac, help with digestive problems and have antioxidant and sedative qualities; it is also said to be a skin irritant, so it should be heavily diluted with milder oils.
Hot cross buns are traditionally eaten on Good Friday, which falls on April 18 in 2025. These spicy, slightly sweet buns can be delicious; of course, the cross can be omitted if you are not a Christian.
Some people like to eat hot cross buns fresh, but I prefer them a little stale - cut in half and toasted on both sides in a lightly oiled skillet (or under a grill) then spread with salted butter."

The US-China trade war may undermine overseas demand for Chinese goods and dent a recovery in corporate earnings as they turn to reluctant domestic buyers to open their purse strings, according to Morgan Stanley.
The impact on corporate earnings would probably be more visible from the second quarter, assuming there was no further escalation in trade tensions or a bigger fiscal support from Beijing, analysts Laura Wang and Chloe Liu said in a report.
Earnings from members of the MSCI China Index came in within market expectations in the fourth quarter, according to the US investment bank, after missing targets in the preceding three and half years.
“The tariff tensions will cast further uncertainty on the earnings outlook,” the analysts said. “We see downward risk to our base case earnings growth outlook for 2025, despite the latest improved quarterly results from the fourth quarter.”

Fans in Singapore will have the earlier chance to see Arsenal and Milan, at the National Stadium. Arsenal will play Milan there on July 23 and host an open training session two days later before meeting Newcastle on July 27."

For US President Donald Trump, there would be few bigger victories than having a domestically produced version of the iPhone, one of the most popular tech products in history. Such a prize would validate his tariff plan and campaign promise to bring manufacturing jobs back to America.
And the administration clearly feels this is an achievable goal, especially in the face of more than 125 per cent tariffs that it aims to impose on imports from China, Apple Inc.’s current manufacturing hub. The company also has vowed to invest US$500 billion domestically over the next four years.
This week, the White House made its stance clear: Trump wants Apple to begin building the device in the US. “If Apple didn’t think the United States could do it, they probably wouldn’t have put up that big chunk of change,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.
But the reality is far different. Apple is unlikely to move iPhone production to the US in the foreseeable future for a variety of reasons, including the shortage of facilities and labour needed to produce the devices. Moreover, the country lacks the rich ecosystem of suppliers, manufacturing and engineering know-how that – for now – can only be found in Asia.
The company also is more focused on turning India into its new source of US-bound iPhones. Apple’s partners are building the world’s second-largest iPhone plant in that country, decreasing the company’s reliance on China."

An unreleased song by the late Taiwanese pop singer Teresa Teng, a darling of East Asian audiences from the 1970s to the 1990s, has been discovered in Japan and will be released in June, a source familiar with the matter said this week.
The light pop song, probably recorded in the mid-1980s, was a joint work of composer Takashi Miki and lyricist Toyohisa Araki, the duo behind Teng’s hits in Japan including “Toki no Nagare ni Mi wo Makase” (“Give yourself to the flow of time”).
The song, with a tone different from Teng’s dramatic Japanese melodies such as “Tsugunai” (“Atonement”), will be included in a three-CD album of Miki’s compositions to be released on June 25, according to the source.
An official of Universal Music found the song recorded on a tape stored in a warehouse in Tokyo several years ago while trying to sort past recordings.
As the song was untitled, Araki named it “Love Song wa Yogiri ga Osuki”, which translates as “Love songs like fog at night.”"

Keretapi Sarong, a flashmob-style event held annually in September, invites participants to wear sarongs and ride public trains in a show of national pride. Since its inception in 2012, the celebration has grown in popularity and even spread abroad, with gatherings held last year in cities including Paris, Berlin and Amsterdam.
However, the organisers’ recent pledge to prevent “cross-dressing” at this year’s event has sparked criticism from activists and long-time supporters, who say it reflects a broader push to sideline marginalised communities as Malaysia’s political climate turns more conservative.
In response to online complaints about gender-nonconforming participants at previous events, organiser Locco posted on X, formerly Twitter: “Let us all stamp out cross-dressing! This is a cultural event, [everyone] should be more aware.”
The group’s position aligned with comments from social media users who said the event should not resemble a pride parade. One user, Mein Mokhtar, wrote: “If you can’t respect the event organiser and can’t abide and comply with the rules, then you are not welcome.”

In a discovery that may rewrite the map of human prehistory, fossilised genetic evidence has revealed that the Denisovans – an elusive counterpart of the Neanderthals – ventured far beyond their Siberian origins, reaching the subtropical shores of the Taiwan Strait.
Published in Science on Friday, the identification of a male Denisovan jawbone aged 130,000–190,000 years from the seabed in the Penghu Channel marks the first direct proof of their presence in the region, shattering assumptions about their geographic limits.
The fossil, dubbed Penghu 1, not only underscores these archaic humans’ astonishing adaptability to diverse climates – from frigid Siberian caves to balmy Southeast Asian coastlines – but also strengthens the genetic link between Denisovans and modern Asian populations, who today carry a DNA legacy from these forebears.
As the farthest-reaching Denisovan fossil ever found, Penghu 1 challenges classical migration narratives and shows how these ancient cousins shaped humanity’s evolutionary story.
Last year, National Science Review reporters posed a sharp and vital question to Svante Paabo, recipient of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for groundbreaking discoveries in the field of ancient human genomes and human evolution: “What could be the next breakthrough in ancient human genomics?”
The professor’s answer was very concise: the Denisovans – an enigmatic relative of modern humans.
Unlike the widely studied Neanderthals, the first Denisova hominin skeletal fossils were discovered by Russian scientists in the Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains in 2008, leading to their naming in 2010."

The court ruled that the pedestrians in question did not need to pay compensation because they were not obliged to help, the news portal Sohu reported.

Hong Kong police have arrested 139 people in connection with fraud syndicates running investment, dating and shopping scams, among other activities, that resulted in losses of more than HK$130 million (US$16.8 million).
The force said on Friday that a businesswoman in her fifties suffered the single largest loss among the cases linked to the recent arrests. She was tricked into transferring HK$33 million across 40 transactions to “mule accounts” operated by scammers.
The term refers to bank accounts suspected of being sold or rented out for laundering crime proceeds.
Police arrested 100 men and 39 women, aged 19 to 73, in the crackdown. The suspects included people working as domestic helpers, waiters and renovators.
Senior Inspector Wong Yuen-yan, of the Kowloon West regional technology and financial crime unit, said the police operation ran from late March to early April and aimed to dismantle networks providing mule accounts to fraud syndicates.
“The fraud syndicates have multilayered structures, and police have been dealing these criminals a blow at different levels,” she said."

British raider Dubai Honour, who holds an entry for the Group One QE II Cup (2,000m) at Sha Tin later this month, looms as the biggest challenger.
He has raced three times in Australia for three Group One victories, including his first-up triumph in the Group One Tancred Stakes (2,400m) at Rosehill on April 1.
The William Haggas-trained gelding, who finished second in last December’s Group One Hong Kong Vase (2,400m) at Sha Tin, claimed the Group One Ranvet Stakes (2,000m) and then the Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2023.
Via Sistina, Australia’s Horse of the Year-elect, completed her last campaign with three consecutive Group One victories and resumed with a third in the Group Two Apollo Stakes (1,400m) on February 15 and then strung together Group One victories at her next two starts.
She's just the best!

Victory on Saturday will equal champion mare Winx’s record of seven of her 25 Group One victories achieved in one season. Chris Waller, who trains Via Sistina, also trained Winx during her extraordinary career.
Haggas’ assistant trainer Issy Paul isn’t underestimating the task Dubai Honour, who has drawn barrier 13 in the 15-horse field, faces as he attempts to win his fourth Australian Group One.
“To win a fourth would be amazing and to do two and two would really round it off,” Paul said. “I think it would be a serious training performance if we managed to get this done.
“[Via Sistina] is obviously very, very good, and I would have preferred a draw that was slightly further in, but it is what it is. Obviously, not scared, but you are wary of them and respectful of them, and I just hope he can put his best foot forward.”

The offer came as senior US officials, including the influential White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, raised concerns about Chinese goods being sent to America with “made-in-Vietnam” labels that draw lower duties.
Vietnam has for weeks been offering sweeteners that it hoped would persuade the US President Donald Trump’s administration to take a benign view of its huge trade surplus with America. Instead, it was hit with a 46 per cent tariff as part of Trump’s “Liberation Day” salvo. While the tariff has been suspended for 90 days, the two countries agreed to start talks after a Vietnamese deputy prime minister met the US Trade Representative on Wednesday.
Export-reliant Vietnam is hoping to get the duties reduced to a range of 22 per cent to 28 per cent, if not lower, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.
One of them said that US officials had signalled that range was likely during a bilateral meeting in March. Vietnam’s trade ministry and the USTR’s office did not return a request for comment.
In announcing the start of trade talks with the US on Thursday, Vietnam’s government said on its official portal it would crack down on “trade fraud”. It did not provide specifics. Since Trump’s first term, many multinational firms have implemented a “China plus one” policy of setting up factories in Vietnam to reduce exposure to Beijing."

Alibaba Group Holding founder Jack Ma delivered a rare speech to the company’s cloud unit on Thursday, laying out his ideas and vision for a responsible and human-oriented artificial intelligence (AI), as the tech giant pivots to become China’s AI enabler.
Ma, 60, made a surprise visit to Alibaba Cloud’s campus in Hangzhou on Thursday, wearing an employee badge, to show support for the unit. According to an edited transcript of his speech provided by Alibaba, Ma drove home the message that the ultimate purpose of AI is to help people live better and more meaningful lives.
Ma, who remains the spiritual leader of the business empire he created 26 years ago, told employees at a ceremony kicking off a new fiscal year that the purpose of technology like AI was not to conquer “galaxies and oceans”, a poetic phrase in China referring to lofty goals and ambitions, but to protect the “smoke and fire of a mortal world”.
While Alibaba Cloud’s resources and tech talent were its advantages in AI and computing, the business also had to be responsible when it came to AI development, Ma said. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.
“The purpose of technology is to help people live better, more meaningful lives and to ensure that everyone benefits from it,” Ma said. The role of technology was to bring change to everyone’s life and offer “dignity” to every individual, he added.
In a speech full of philosophical statements and few business details, Ma also emphasised that AI should be developed with the aim of understanding and serving humanity, not replacing it, an appeal made in response to growing public concern over the rapid progress of AI.
“I hope that all of us … will continue to work together to bring the world into a kind and hi-tech era,” Ma said. “We are not trying to make machines like humans, but rather to enable machines to understand humans, think like humans, and do things that humans cannot do,” Ma said."

In September 2021, he spoke to a member of Tillis’ staff based in North Carolina’s Raleigh and threatened to “show up” and “put a bullet through each of [their heads]”. He also threatened to “mow down” the “whole [expletive] state” and “find the person who emailed him and cut off their hands,” officials said."

Now that the explosive finale to The White Lotus has premiered, are you ready to go to Thailand for your experience? Without the killing and bloodshed, of course. One of the main filming locations for season 3 was the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui, in the northwest of the island.
There are many reasons to go to Koh Samui and it is an ideal location for families, providing parents an environment where they can relax.
While southern areas like Chaweng and Lamai are known for their vibrant nightlife and crowded beaches, the north offers a quieter atmosphere; it is more accessible, with calmer waters and plenty of local charm.
Samui International Airport is in the northeast of the island, meaning families arriving or departing can avoid long transfers on the island’s winding roads, where traffic can be an issue – a relief when travelling with children. Another attraction, the Big Buddha Temple (Wat Phra Yai), is also in the north, making a day trip less stressful."

When fabric exporter Xie Jun registered early for the Canton Fair, he had high hopes for finding more clients – particularly those from overseas – at China’s oldest and largest trade expo.
But the seemingly endless back-and-forth between Beijing and Washington, with one tariff increase after another, has left him deflated.
“I want to know if others are feeling the same level of confusion and panic,” he said.
“And I want to hear what Plan Bs others are considering.”
The three-week spring session of the Canton Fair, set to commence on Tuesday in the southern city of Guangzhou, is widely viewed as a barometer for the health of China’s foreign trade."

Owned by the Liang family, California Spangle broke through at the top level with a thrilling Group One Hong Kong Mile victory over the great Golden Sixty later that same year.
While California Spangle’s big early wins came under Zac Purton, it was Brenton Avdulla who was in the saddle as Tony Cruz’s star galloper enjoyed a resurgence as a sprinter with victories in last year’s Group One Queen’s Silver Jubilee Cup (1,400m) and Dubai’s Group One Al Quoz Sprint (1,200m).

“He was a superstar from the very beginning. It was fun training him because there was a lot of happiness and excitement with him,” said Cruz of a horse who reached a career-high ranking of 130.
“He was a record-breaker right from the start in Griffin races at 1,000m [and] 1,200m. Then he broke the track record for 1,200m in Dubai as well. He was such an easy horse to train, too. You could do anything with him.
“He was a very exciting horse. No matter how fast you wanted to go, he could give it to you.
“Now, it’s the end of the road for him, we’ll keep him healthy and, if he’s allowed to, he can then go to Living Legends in Australia. For the Liang family and myself, he’s had an amazing career.”

US troops will be able to deploy to a string of bases along the Panama Canal under a joint deal seen by Agence France-Presse on Thursday, a major concession to President Donald Trump as he seeks to reestablish influence over the vital waterway.
The agreement, signed by top security officials from both countries, allows US military personnel to deploy to Panama-controlled facilities for training, exercises and “other activities”.
The deal stops short of allowing the United States to build its own permanent bases on the isthmus, a move that would be deeply unpopular with Panamanians and legally fraught.
But it gives the US broad sway to deploy an unspecified number of personnel to bases, some of which Washington built when it occupied the canal zone decades ago.
Trump, since returning to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 per cent of US container traffic and five per cent of world trade.
His administration has vowed to “take back” control of the strategic waterway that the US funded, built and controlled until 1999."

President Xi Jinping will set off on a tour of three Southeast Asian countries next week as Beijing urgently seeks to strengthen ties with its neighbours amid an intensifying tariff war with Washington.
They will be Xi’s first foreign visits of the year and the trip comes as Beijing faces pressure to strengthen ties with neighbouring countries amid escalating tensions with Washington over US President Donald Trump’s sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs.
While China has vowed to fight Trump’s tariffs, economic ministers from the Asean bloc said on Thursday that they would not impose retaliatory measures and would instead seek to engage in “frank and constructive” dialogue with the US.
China is seeking to present itself as a credible partner for Southeast Asia, where anxieties are growing over Washington’s commitment to the region.
China’s neighbours were a “priority” in its diplomacy, the foreign ministry said, adding that China and Southeast Asia were “good neighbours, good friends and good partners with a shared destiny”."

China’s automotive industry, a bright spot in the world’s second-largest economy, remains exposed to an escalating US-China tariff war, with component manufacturers likely to bear the brunt of the trade fallout, analysts said.
At risk is the 100 billion yuan (US$13.6 billion) worth of car parts – from electric-car batteries to lidar sensors and drive control systems – that Chinese companies shipped to the US annually, as tariffs on all Chinese-made goods surged to 125 per cent, from just 10 per cent three months ago.
“The sweeping tariffs are destructive to the growth of China’s supply-chain vendors like battery producers, though they would also block carmakers’ access to more advanced parts,” said David Zhang, general secretary of the International Intelligent Vehicle Engineering Association. “Car assemblers may have dodged the bullet as they do not rely on the US market for sales and growth.”
An index compiled by consultancy East Money Information that tracks 26 mainland-listed carmakers slumped 7 per cent this week through Thursday, while a gauge tracking 230 car component producers dived 10.2 per cent. The Hang Seng Shanghai-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Automobile Index, comprising 55 car and parts makers, lost 9.2 per cent.

Hong Kong shippers and trading groups have urged exporters not to dump shipments mid-voyage to avoid crushing US tariffs, warning that the “irrational” move will incur huge costs while tarnishing the reputation of the company involved and the country.
Willy Lin Sun-mo, chairman of the Hong Kong Shippers’ Council, said he had not heard of similar cases involving local exporters, but cautioned that such acts had severe consequences.
“This is highly irrational and irresponsible as dumping the goods at sea will mean the exporter will lose everything, including effort and money. Apart from losing the cargo, it will fail to claim insurance for failing to fulfil contractual obligations and risks being sued by the importer or potential customers for damages,” he said.
“The move will not only severely hurt its reputation and deter overseas buyers, leading to diminishing orders, but also tarnish China’s trade reputation, which will be a lose-lose for everyone.”
US President Donald Trump clarified on Thursday that Chinese imports would be tariffed at 145 per cent, while implementing a 90-day pause that set levies at a “baseline” 10 per cent for most countries."

Hong Kong’s benchmark stock index closed up on Friday, trimming some of the losses that capped its worst week in more than seven years, as the tit-for-tat tariff war between the world’s two largest economies shows no sign of abating.
The Hang Seng Index advanced 1.1 per cent to 20,914.69 on Friday. The late rally helped narrow the loss for the week to 8.5 per cent, the worst since February 9, 2018. The index has declined 15.6 per cent from a peak on March 19, erasing HK$4.4 trillion (US$567.3 billion) of market value from its 83 members.

Electric-car maker BYD jumped 7.2 per cent to HK$368.80 and peer Li Auto advanced 5.6 per cent to HK$90.15, while China’s biggest chipmaker SMIC strengthened 5.9 per cent to HK$46.70. Among losers, Trip.com slumped 4.6 per cent to HK$427.40, while Alibaba Group Holding lost 1.7 per cent to HK$103 and Meituan fell 1.3 per cent to HK$143.50.
Mainland investors were net buyers of HK$11.7 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed shares via the Stock Connect scheme on Friday, according to stock exchange data.

Patch Of Theta drops significantly back in grade after finishing down the field in consecutive Group One efforts, with the five-year-old to carry 127 pounds from gate two under Hugh Bowman.
“He needs a fast pace, otherwise he will be too keen. He still needs to improve off his last few runs,” said Lui.
Never out of the placings across 10 starts in his debut campaign last season, including four wins, Hong Kong International Sale graduate Patch Of Theta has added another two wins to his CV this term.
Smart win, Patch Of Theta! 🫡

The second of those was a comfortable success in January’s Group Three Chinese Club Challenge Cup (1,400m) and the 108-rated galloper looks perfectly suited at the same course and distance on Sunday.
Divano is another galloper who should be right at home over Sha Tin’s seven furlongs, with the four-year-old a close third behind Packing Hermod and Young Champion at the trip in Class Two last month.
A swashbuckling runner-up in January’s Classic Mile after rattling home under Blake Shinn, the 1,800m of the Classic Cup was a bridge too far for Divano and Lui has stepped his charge back in trip after he ran 10th in the second leg of the Classic Series.
Angus Chung Yik-lai jumps aboard the son of Brave Smash for the first time this weekend, with the three-pound claimer reducing his mount’s impost to just 112 pounds.
Divano has drawn outside his stablemate Patch Of Theta in gate three and Chung will have options with a galloper who has proven he can race on the speed or leave his run until late.
“He’s in good form and he has a light weight,” said Lui. “We’ve got two good chances.”
Lui isn’t the only handler entering Sunday’s feature with multiple hopes, with Pierre Ng Pang-chi saddling up Mugen, Taj Dragon and Drombeg Banner.
After a slow start to the season which included a 13th in the Group One Sprinters Stakes (1,200m) in Japan, Mugen is third up from a spell this weekend and appears to be close to returning to top form after a solid Class One fourth behind Lucky With You last time out.
While Britney Wong Po-ni was in the saddle on that occasion, Luke Ferraris takes the reins on Sunday and Mugen carries 126 pounds.
Also in the race is Classic Cup winner Rubylot, who steps back from the 2,000m of the Hong Kong Derby before returning to 10 furlongs for the Group One QE II Cup later this month.

Information to help travellers navigate through a natural disaster is available via a new page that was added to the city’s tourism website late last year, according to the officials, who say it has come about due to lessons learned in the aftermath of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in northeast Japan.
“Kyoto City has learned from the 2011 earthquake, which caused more than 5 million people in the Tokyo metropolitan area to have difficulty returning to their homes,” said Jun Kawamura, director of Kyoto’s disaster prevention coordination division.

The fund will support China’s state-led strategy through equity investments, with contributions from Phase III of the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, the state-backed fund aimed at supporting chip industry investment, according to Zhang.
The AI fund will be managed by Guozhi Investment (Shanghai) Private Equity Fund Management, a state-backed company, according to Zhang.

Hong Kong has prepared for the worst as the United States may shut down the city’s three trade offices in the country, the commerce minister has said, indicating that authorities will restructure their overseas set-up amid escalating US-China tensions.
Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau Ying-wah also said on Friday that Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu would lead a delegation with mainland Chinese companies to the Middle East next month to expand Hong Kong’s international trade network.
Yau made the remarks during a special Legislative Council Finance Committee meeting, following US President Donald Trump’s latest move to further raise tariffs on small parcels sent to his country from the mainland and Hong Kong to 120 per cent from 90 per cent.
“In the overall planning of our overseas trade offices, we’ll have a new plan to restructure our set-up in these countries or regions. We’ve done some preparation work but we cannot divulge the details at this stage,” Yau said.
“About whether the US will close Hong Kong’s three trade offices, we have prepared for the worst as to how we should redeploy our resources to respond to this happening.”"

Triathlete Robin Elg said his parents struggled to accept his decision to relinquish his French passport, but the Asian under-23 champion decided to take up Hong Kong citizenship for the benefit of his career.
Elg is in a race against time to be eligible for November’s National Games, having begun his passport application process at the turn of the year.
On current and recent form, Elg, who was part of Hong Kong’s Asia Sprint Championships bronze medal relay team last weekend, would almost certainly be selected.
His documents are being processed in France, with Elg optimistic “the Hong Kong side will be really fast”.
“It was a hard decision; I talked about it with my parents and it was hard for them to accept,” Elg said. “I am where I am in triathlon thanks to Hong Kong’s financial support and infrastructure, and I need to repay what Hong Kong has given me.
“I want to represent [the city] in major Games and I feel I have the level to be selected. To go further in my career, I need to get [the passport process] done.”"

Hong Kong property investors have continued to put up assets for sale at a loss as a tariff war between the US and China escalates, unsettling a market that has already struggled to overcome years of distress.
Bridgeway Prime Shop Fund Management sold a ground-level shop at One Eighty in Shau Kei Wan for HK$20.1 million (US$2.6 million) on April 8, founder Edwin Lee said, implying a 20 per cent loss. The fund paid HK$25 million each on average for two ground-level lots and a first-floor shop in the building in July 2023.
“The capital market will definitely be impacted by the trade war as investment confidence weakens,” Lee said by phone on Thursday. “Just like developers, we cannot hoard our stocks and wait while the market continues to drop.
The fund, which focuses exclusively on shops and retail assets, would continue to buy and sell assets with good potential to maintain its liquidity, Lee added.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday imposed a 90-day moratorium on higher tariffs against most of its trading partners except mainland China and Hong Kong. On top of that, he raised the total tariff on imports from China to 125 per cent with effect from Thursday.
Beijing earlier raised its levy on all imports from the US to 84 per cent and vowed to fight back against tariffs. Traders expect Beijing to step up its stimulus measures to support the economy."

Lee, who lost the presidency to Yoon by the narrowest margin in South Korean history in 2022, now enjoys a commanding lead in the polls. A Gallup Korea poll released this week showed him with 34 per cent support – nearly four times that of his nearest rival.
He stepped down as leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) on Wednesday to focus fully on his campaign.
With South Korea grappling with a political vacuum, rising regional tensions and growing economic uncertainty, Lee’s potential return is drawing fresh international attention. His focus on national interest and diplomatic balance has positioned him as a clear alternative to Yoon’s hardline, values-driven foreign policy.
“It is important to maintain close ties with our ally, the United States, and to strengthen trilateral cooperation with Japan,” Lee said in the video announcing his candidacy.
“But the guiding principle must be our national interest. We will cooperate where cooperation is needed and compete where competition is necessary while managing any frictions appropriately.”"

Nearly 1.2 million Chinese university students have applied for 8,000 positions at China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), a prominent state-owned conglomerate, during a recruitment drive on campuses, underscoring the stiff competition young people face in today’s job market.
CNNC, China’s civilian and military nuclear giant, sparked a public backlash after proudly announcing last weekend that it had received 1.196 million résumés from young jobseekers during its recently concluded recruitment campaign. That equates to about 150 candidates per vacancy.
A record 12.22 million students are expected to graduate from universities and colleges this summer.
CNNC’s announcement, posted on its WeChat social media account on Saturday, boasted of the “strong magnetic effect” of its ability to lure top students and its role in injecting sustainable momentum into industry-academia integration and innovation.
But it quickly sparked a wave of criticism, with many calling it offensive and arrogant and some accusing CNNC of “showing off its attractiveness”.
“This push is so offensive. The pain of job-hunting for fresh graduates shouldn’t be a company’s source of pride,” said Lisa Bai, a university student in Shanghai.
Finding suitable employment remains a challenge for many young people in China amid economic headwinds, including an intensifying trade war with the United States."

The US Supreme Court on Thursday said the Trump administration must facilitate the return of a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, rejecting the administration’s emergency appeal.
The court acted in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen who had an immigration court order preventing his deportation to his native country over fears he would face persecution from local gangs.
US District Judge Paula Xinis had ordered Abrego Garcia, now being held in a notorious Salvadoran prison, returned to the United States by midnight Monday.
“The order properly requires the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador,” the court said in an unsigned order with no noted dissents.
Chief Justice John Roberts had already pushed back Xinis’ deadline, and the justices said that her order must now be clarified to make sure it does not intrude into executive branch power over foreign affairs, since Abrego Garcia is being held abroad.
The court said the Trump administration should also be prepared to share what steps it has taken to try and get him back – and what more it could do."

Hong Kong skateboarders will be able to show off their skills at a new skatepark in Fanling on Saturday, with part of the site becoming the first of its kind in the city to receive a competition class certification from an international governing body.
The Leisure and Cultural Services Department said on Thursday that the skate bowl at On Lok Mun Street Playground had been certified as “Competition Class 1 star” for holding events, while its street course had attained “Recreational Class 3 stars”.
The spokesman said the certifications were awarded by World Skate, the governing body officially recognised by the International Olympic Committee for skateboarding and roller sports.
The Civil Engineering and Development Department’s Tom Leung Wai-lok, a senior engineer involved in the park’s construction, said authorities had collaborated with US company California Skateparks, which had built the skateboarding venue for the Paris Olympics.
“Experts from Japan, Mexico and the United States had just finished the skatepark for the Paris Olympics, and then came to Hong Kong to build this skatepark for us,” he said.
“They are also skateboarding enthusiasts. With their craft and their attention to detail, they have meticulously built the skatepark to ensure a smooth skating experience.”"

China’s publicly listed companies have unveiled at least 20 billion yuan (US$2.73 billion) in buy-backs this week, as they set aside resources to prop up their own stock during a global meltdown in equity markets triggered by US President Donald Trump’s tariff war.
These 100 companies are joining several deep-pocketed state funds under the umbrella of the nation’s US$1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund, as they buy back shares and increase their stakes to prop up prices and prevent a meltdown in the US$10 trillion onshore stock market.
China’s central bank said this week that it would put its financial muscle and relending facilities behind the government’s buy-backs. China Chengtong Holdings Group and China Reform Holdings Corp. said they had allocated 100 billion yuan from the 1.63 trillion yuan of state-owned capital to buy stocks.
These buy-backs “can be effective in containing the spread of panic and reducing the stampede in the market,” said Xu Chi, an analyst at Zhongtai Securities in Shanghai. “Besides curbing short-term volatility, [the biggest] listed companies are also sending a message of confidence in their future earnings to quell any panic [about] their businesses.”"

From New Legend of Madam White Snake (1992) to Meteor Garden (2001), Taiwanese dramas have long held a place in mainland Chinese entertainment. The often strained cross-strait relations over the years have done little to dampen the appeal and love for the genre.
Their popularity may have something to do with the fact that some Taiwanese productions have not been afraid to delve into contemporary issues such as gender equality and LGBTQ lifestyles.
Fang Kecheng, an assistant professor in the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, says the appeal of Taiwanese dramas for mainland Chinese audiences lies in their uncensored coverage of societal issues.
“Despite the political tensions and the halt to cultural exchanges, mainland Chinese and Taiwanese people share many similarities in social and cultural conceptions,” he says.
“People can see themselves in Taiwanese dramas.”
From romance to fantasy, here are the five Taiwanese dramas that have the highest scores on Douban, the popular mainland Chinese entertainment review aggregator website."

US President Donald Trump, whose dramatic reversal on global trade tariffs sent markets reeling this week, is no stranger to the U-turn. Here are some notable examples.
At the end of his first term, Trump unsuccessfully tried to ban social media network TikTok, accusing the popular platform of siphoning American user data for Beijing’s benefit.
But on the campaign trail in 2024, while courting Gen Z votes, Trump said “I like TikTok” and declared: “I’m going to save TikTok.”
He now says he is close to a deal for TikTok to find a non-Chinese buyer who would take it from its Chinese owner ByteDance to avoid it getting shut down in the United States.

TikTok is back online as Donald Trump vows executive order to temporarily block ban
When it comes to the thorny issue of abortion rights, Trump has changed on his position over the past 25 years.
“I am very pro-choice,” he said in 1999, stating his opposition to banning abortion.
Trump changed his tune during the 2016 presidential campaign while courting the votes of evangelical Christians, and called for “some form of punishment” for women who seek abortion. In office, he is a staunch opponent of abortion.
During Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, he advocated for better relations with Moscow, but that stance quietened as accusations arose around Russia’s election interference in his favour."

“Bukayo Saka has not suffered any serious injury,” Gunners manager Mikel Arteta said. “He’s fine – I think it was a kick.”

“That is something we hadn’t seen until these past few years.”
As the list of those rounded up in China’s years-long anti-corruption probes becomes longer, a growing number of mid-level officials across the country have started to consider the once unthinkable – what if they are next?
The anxiety has become more distinct since President Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption drive entered its second decade – with no signs of slowing down.
“As long as the soil and conditions for corruption exist, the anti-corruption struggle cannot stop for a moment. We must always sound the charge,” Xi declared at the 20th party congress in 2022."

Ian Leslie’s John & Paul: A Love Story in Songs, takes a long look – 426 pages – at how John Lennon and Paul McCartney worked together from their meeting as teenagers until John’s death.
Had McCartney not decided at age 15 to go to hear Lennon’s band playing in a Liverpool suburb, the world may have been denied the multitude of Beatle songs that brightened a generation and brought escalating musical innovation to rock music.
As Leslie affirms in the book, Lennon and McCartney early on developed a personal and creative chemistry that allowed them to elevate each other’s work to the timeless classics still heard around the world.
And into that relationship dives Leslie, analysing the mountain of articles and books written about the Beatles and interpreting messages the two men were sending to each other in their solo songs, particularly after the band’s break-up when both were writing and performing as solo acts.
Leslie focuses on exploring the often tortured relationship between the introverted, sometimes jealous and frequently depressed Lennon and the more outgoing, driven and businesslike McCartney.
Leslie’s comprehensive assembly of lyrics, memos and actions of the two men strays into gossip sometimes in his effort to define their relationship. The book labours to find where the Lennon-McCartney relationship fell in the spectrum of best buds to bromance."

The United States government will identify the cause of autism by September this year, US Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jnr said on Thursday.
“At your direction, we are going to know by September. We’ve launched a massive testing and research effort that’s going to involve hundreds of scientists from around the world,” Kennedy said at a meeting of US President Donald Trump’s cabinet.
“By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we’ll be able to eliminate those exposures.”
Trump in February ordered the creation of a “Make America Healthy Again” Commission made up of Kennedy and other secretaries to look at everything from the rates of autism and asthma in children to how much medicine is being prescribed to them for ADHD or other conditions.
Kennedy said the prevalence of autism has jumped dramatically in recent decades.
“The autism rates have gone – from our most recent numbers, we think are going to be about one in 31 from one in 10,000 when I was a kid,” he said, without offering more detail or citing the source of the figures."

The top US commander in the Pacific warned senators on Thursday that the military support that China and North Korea are giving Russia in its war on Ukraine is a security risk in his region as Moscow provides critical military aid to both in return.
Admiral Samuel Paparo, head of US Indo-Pacific Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that China has provided 70 per cent of the machine tools and 90 per cent of the legacy chips to Russia to help Moscow “rebuild its war machine”.
In exchange, he said, China is potentially getting help in technologies to make its submarines move more quietly, along with other help.
Senators pressed Paparo and General Xavier Brunson, commander of US Forces Korea, on China’s advances in the region, including threats to Taiwan.
Beijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the US, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the self-governed island by force and is committed to supplying it with weapons.
Senators also questioned both commanders on the US military presence in South Korea, and whether it should be shielded from personnel cuts.
Both said the current US force there and across the Indo-Pacific is critical for both diplomacy in the region and America’s national security, as ties between Russia and China grow. The US has 28,500 forces in South Korea."

The higher figure includes the 125 per cent rate that covers the so-called “reciprocal” duties announced by Trump as well as a 20 per cent rate imposed earlier this year over China’s involvement in fentanyl trafficking.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down over 1,000 points, or 2.5 per cent; the S&P 500 slid 3.5 per cent; and Nasdaq fell over 4 per cent.
The markets were giving back large portions of the gains they had made in the Wednesday’s historic rally, when Trump backed down on his most punishing tariffs on nations he called the “worst offenders” by postponing them for 90 days, though the baseline 10 per cent tariffs on goods from all US trading partners that he announced last week remain in effect.
At the same time, he announced the 125 per cent tariffs on China and said they would go into effect immediately.
Confirmation of the higher rate is likely to escalate the stand-off between Washington and Beijing, which became the main target of the Trump administration’s efforts to reverse America’s overall trade deficit.
Responding to the clarified tariff rate, Chinese embassy in Washington spokesperson Liu Pengyu said: “China does not want to fight these wars but is not scared of them”."

After the announcement, Trump said he was open to talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, adding that he “can’t imagine” raising tariffs on China further. He earlier claimed that China would call him to “make a deal”.
On Thursday, China’s commerce and foreign ministries repeated that China was open to negotiations with the US only if they were conducted in a “fair and mutually respectful” manner. They also said they would “fight to the end” if the US wanted a trade war.
“It is no longer a game about tariffs themselves, but a game of strategic resolve,” Zhao Minghao, deputy director at the Centre for American Studies at Fudan University, in Shanghai, said in reference to the recent back-and-forth tariffs.

Aboelkheir’s victory meant that the Egyptian was entitled to a place in the qualifying tournament for next month’s senior world championships in Chicago, although her rank of 14th in the world means that the 19-year-old is expected to make the cut for the main draw automatically.
The Post has been told that the right to play in the qualifiers would not pass instead to Chan in the event of Aboelkheir already having a spot.

The airline on Thursday told staff that on average more than one on-board incident involving the batteries occurred every week across the world.
“With this background in mind, we studied the option of allowing our operating crew to store their power banks in other closed compartments, for example, the cloakrooms,” Vincent Yu, the airline’s general manager of in-flight service delivery, said in an internal memo.
“However, given our in-flight duties, storing a power bank that cannot be monitored is a risk because it cannot be detected before it compromises safety.”

With tit-for-tat tariffs escalating the US-China trade war to never-before-seen levels in the past week, their high-stakes game of one-upmanship could turn into a marathon that tests the long-term resilience of economic and industrial systems, according to prominent Chinese economists.
As Beijing and Washington battle it out in a rapidly escalating and brutal tit-for-tat tariff war, it is becoming increasingly difficult to see how the two leaders could end up at the negotiating table.
Chinese citizens surveyed put forward a range of responses and, while they worried about a trade war, many were in favour of Beijing’s strong response."

A number of listed Chinese semiconductor companies have reassured investors that they are largely unaffected by China’s increased import tariffs, citing earlier US sanctions as a mitigating factor.
Cambricon Technologies, a Shanghai-listed AI processor developer, said on Thursday that its overseas revenue in both 2023 and 2024 accounted for less than 1 per cent of total revenue. The company already faced significant restrictions from its inclusion on the US Entity List in 2022, it noted.
“The latest tariff increases will not substantially impact our operations,” the company said.
Chip designer Loongson Technology also said on Thursday that the latest tariffs “have no negative impact on the company”, and emphasised its commitment to independent research and development of chips, software systems and self-controllable supply chains, along with zero US-based revenue.

China has vowed to strengthen and improve its export-control measures to safeguard its interests, in a bid to mitigate some of the fallout from a rapidly intensifying trade war with the United States.
The Ministry of Commerce (Mofcom) said it will accelerate efforts to strengthen the country’s export control system and improve enforcement, as it navigates an “increasingly complex and challenging global environment”.
“We will step up item classification, tighten licensing enforcement, expand multilateral and bilateral dialogue on export controls, and promote compliance frameworks,” the ministry said at an export-control work meeting in Beijing on Thursday.
“These efforts aim to further modernise China’s national export-control system and better safeguard the country’s sovereignty, security and development interests.”
While the statement did not explicitly mention the United States, it came amid escalating trade tensions with Washington. And to date, all of Beijing’s export-control lists have targeted US entities.
After the series of back-and-forth tariff salvoes, as it stands, Washington has imposed a 125 per cent tariff on Chinese imports this year, bringing the effective tariff rate to about 136 per cent. Meanwhile, Beijing’s new levy on US goods has risen to 84 per cent, also on top of earlier-imposed tariffs.
And China also carried out other countermeasures by imposing export controls on 28 US entities in two separate rounds, while also adding an additional 17 American firms to its unreliable-entities list."

“Every Hong Kong dollar invested by the HKIC has attracted over HK$4 from long-term capital for investment,” she added.

Hong Kong lawmakers have called on the government to step up enforcement of a law requiring landlords to submit tenancy agreement details for subdivided flats, as only 52,700 have been received for the 108,000 such homes in the city.
Lawmaker Vincent Cheng Wing-shun said on Thursday the government should do more to ensure the information was filed, noting only 52,756 forms had been received since the requirement was made compulsory under the Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance that came into force in 2022.
The city has 108,200 subdivided flats, according to the 2021 census.
“They have not made a move for three years,” Cheng said during a Legislative Council Finance Committee meeting, referring to landlords. “It is unacceptable.”
Under the ordinance, subdivided flat landlords must sign a two-year tenancy contract, during which they cannot terminate the agreement or increase the rent.
Tenants are entitled to extend their tenancy for two years, with any increase in rent capped at 10 per cent of what they had been paying."

Amid an escalating trade war with the United States, China is holding frequent conversations with the European Union (EU) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) – its two largest trading partners by bloc – with plans to address bilateral issues and forge stronger ties.
Commerce Minister Wang Wentao held a video call with EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic on Tuesday, during which both sides agreed to immediately begin negotiations on electric vehicle (EV) pricing and discuss investment ties in the auto sector, according to a statement released by China’s Ministry of Commerce on Thursday.
They also signalled their readiness to launch market access talks as soon as possible and supported the resumption of a bilateral trade remedy dialogue to address trade frictions related to EU concerns about the diversion of Chinese exports previously destined for the US.
The concrete discussion between Wang and Sefcovic followed a more wide-ranging meeting between Premier Li Qiang and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen earlier on Tuesday.
Following an EV dispute last year, China and the EU began negotiations on a “price undertaking” mechanism for vehicles imported by EU member states to address concerns about Chinese government subsidies and their impact on the European automotive sector. However, no agreement was reached.
At the end of October, the EU raised tariffs on China-made EVs to as high as 45 per cent after an anti-subsidy investigation."

The Taliban’s morality police have detained men and their barbers over hairstyles, and others for missing prayers at mosques during Ramadan, a UN report said on Thursday, six months after laws regulating people’s conduct came into effect.
The Vice and Virtue Ministry published laws last August covering many aspects everyday life in Afghanistan, including public transport, music, shaving and celebrations. Most notably, the ministry issued a ban on women’s voices and bare faces in public.
That same month, a top UN official warned the laws provided a “distressing vision” for the country’s future by adding to existing employment, education, and dress code restrictions on women and girls. Taliban officials have rejected UN concerns about the morality laws.
Thursday’s report, from the UN mission in Afghanistan, said in the first six months of the laws’ implementation, over half of detentions made under it concerned “either men not having the compliant beard length or hairstyle, or barbers providing non-compliant beard trimming or haircuts”.
The report said that the morality police regularly detained people arbitrarily “without due process and legal protections”.

Hong Kong authorities have rolled out three new measures to insure local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) against pre-shipment risks amid the escalating US-China trade war, including providing a 50 per cent premium discount and extending the free protection period.
The measures, which took immediate effect on Thursday, were revealed a day after US President Donald Trump announced that he would be applying a 125 per cent tariff for China while implementing a 90-day pause that set levies at a “baseline” 10 per cent for most countries.
The pre-shipment risk insurance protects businesses from financial losses if an order is cancelled before shipment due to reasons from the buyers’ side, such as insolvency, repudiation of contract and country risks.
Separately, Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu called on Hongkongers abroad to promote free trade in the international arena while actively investing in their home city.
He also appealed to Chinese overseas to advance global cooperation to allow more international companies and talent to settle in Hong Kong and mainland China.
The three measures for SMEs, launched by the Hong Kong Export Credit Insurance Corporation, include extending the free pre-shipment risk cover for policyholders of the “Small Business Policy” to June 30, 2026."

The European Union’s executive commission said Thursday it will put its retaliation measures against new US tariffs on hold for 90 days to match President Donald Trump’s pause on his sweeping new tariffs and leave room for a negotiated solution.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the commission, which handles trade for the 27 member countries, “took note of the announcement by President Trump”.
New tariffs on €20.9 billion (US$23 billion) of US goods will be put on hold for 90 days because “we want to give negotiations a chance”, she said in a statement.
But she warned: “If negotiations are not satisfactory, our countermeasures will kick in.”
Trump imposed a 20 per cent levy on goods from the EU as part of his onslaught of tariffs against global trading partners but has said he will pause them for 90 days to give countries a chance to negotiate solutions to US trade concerns.
“I have authorised a 90 day PAUSE,” Trump said, after recognising the more than 75 countries that he said have been negotiating on trade and had not retaliated against his latest increases in tariffs. Countries subject to the pause will now be tariffed at 10 per cent. The EU’s rate was 20 per cent, but it was not entirely clear how the 27-nation bloc would be impacted.

Police said three of the suspects were core members and three were stooge account holders. Four were men and two were women, ranging in age from 19 to 39. One of them a two-way permit holder from mainland China.
The group, which had been active since June 2023, was accused of carrying out at least 46 scams across the city, including online romance scams, loan fraud and investment schemes, police said.
Victims reportedly suffered losses amounting to HK$13.66 million.
The most significant single case involved a romance scam where a victim was defrauded of HK$1.5 million."

Hong Kong police have arrested three people, including two students aged 14 and 16, for allegedly making “space oil” products worth HK$1 million (US$128,800) and selling them at illegal entertainment venues or online.
The trio – an 18-year-old man, a 16-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy – were caught in a raid on a village house in Kam Tsin Tsuen in Sheung Shui.
They were arrested on suspicion of manufacturing a dangerous drug, an offence that carries a maximum HK$5 million fine and life imprisonment.
“Among those arrested were two minors. It is believed that the drug traffickers lured and exploited these young people by offering them free drugs and meagre payments,” Chief Inspector Tai Yuk-lun of the New Territories North anti-triad squad said on Thursday.
“Police strongly condemn this practice and will seek heavier penalties against the drug traffickers in accordance with the law.”
Space oil is a narcotic that is typically packaged in e-cigarette capsules and contains the anaesthetic etomidate, which has been classified as a dangerous drug under Hong Kong law since February 14.
The investigation revealed that the three suspects, who shared a triad background, had previously attended the same school, with the oldest having dropped out while the younger two remained enrolled as students."

“When we first opened Quinary, our mission was to introduce what we term Multisensory Mixology – a concept that was uncommon in Hong Kong at the time,” he says. “We anticipated it would be well received upon launch, but the fact that it remains a Quinary staple today? Not quite to that extent!” In practice, Lai refers to the now-ubiquitous use of laboratory equipment in modern kitchens, in turn used to craft cutting-edge cocktails – molecular mixology, as it were.
Most are familiar with the cocktail’s maximalist silhouette – a wide martini glass “garnished” with Earl Grey reverse-spherified “caviar” and a towering column of foam. Lai designed the drink specifically for its combination of spectacle, and the playful surprise of biting into the caviar – all focused on delicate and aromatic Earl Grey tea. “When you experience all these elements together, they create a richly layered mouthfeel that makes you fall in love.”
“When people visit a cocktail bar, they often hold a checklist in their mind,” Lai reasons, “a drink that’s unique, delicious, Instagram-worthy, and fun. And I guess our Earl Grey Caviar Martini just ticks all the boxes.”
“The classic martini is a relatively strong cocktail, and I wanted to make it more approachable,” Lai explains. “One way to achieve this is by adding some citrusy and fruity notes to temper the alcohol taste. I’ve experimented with multiple combinations, and it occurred to me that Earl Grey tea itself possesses pungent scents of lemon and bergamot.”
The drink is batched daily to maintain freshness, and in three parts. The core cocktail comprises vodka, Cointreau, elderflower syrup, lemon and apple juices, and cucumber. The caviar is built separately in a bath of dissolved algin powder, whilst lecite powder is heavily used in preparing the Earl Grey foam base before it is whipped up during service."

Ma, 60, visited the Hangzhou campus wearing a T-shirt celebrating the 15th anniversary of Alibaba Cloud and an employee badge with his Alibaba code name, Feng Qingyang, the sword master in a famous Chinese kung fu novel, according to social media posts. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.
Alibaba did not publicly disclose his agenda. Ma, who has stepped down from all his corporate roles, remains a key shareholder and spiritual leader of the business empire he created. In addition, Ma is seen as the face of the Chinese private sector, and his speeches from the early days of Alibaba remain widely available on the Chinese internet to inspire entrepreneurship.
In February, Ma joined a group of Chinese entrepreneurs and executives at a high-profile symposium in Beijing chaired by President Xi Jinping.
Alibaba Cloud is a key player in China when it comes to turning AI models into applications in different industries. Ma’s visit to the unit came one day after it unveiled its Blossom project, which aims to accelerate AI adoption by providing a package of infrastructure, AI models, data and other services to “millions of clients”."

Providing a safer living environment for elderly Hongkongers could cut at least HK$5.67 billion (US$730 million) in annual hospitalisation costs by 2046, the year when over a third of the city’s population is expected to be aged 65 and above, a think tank has said.
Our Hong Kong Foundation on Thursday released a policy research report that set out a series of recommendations for authorities to improve the living environment for elderly residents and support the city’s strategy of “ageing in place” – which means enabling residents to stay at home as they grow old.
The suggestions included boosting the private housing market for the elderly using incentives such as a tiered mechanism offering gross floor area concessions to private developers and setting aside land for residences catering to older people.
The group also suggested the government subsidise home modifications for elderly residents and update the Buildings Ordinance to require new housing projects to incorporate elderly friendly designs.
“We are facing a ‘double ageing’ challenge, as both the population and buildings are growing older, which is an issue we need to address,” think tank president Jane Lee Ching-yee said.
“The policy of ageing in place needs further improvement. Inadequate housing and community support not only affect the elderly but also the long-term development of our society.”"

Special in-flight menus and dedicated in-flight butlers: these were just some of the extras laid on for 65 of the world’s finest show-jumping horses, flying in for the inaugural Hong Kong International Horse Show, which took place earlier this year.
The show marked the return of a large-scale equestrian event to the city after a six-year gap. Cathay Cargo, the show’s official airline partner, managed the operation of bringing horses in from around the world – and most people attending the event remained blissfully unaware of the complex logistics required.
“This was going to be the largest consignment of horses we have ever moved on one flight,” said Christy Au, cargo duty officer for the cargo operation centre at the Cathay Cargo Terminal in Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong-based company is the only carrier in Asia to hold the International Air Transport Association (IATA) approved Center of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) Live Animals accreditation. This certification is a testament to the quality of handling and transporting live animals, ensuring their safety and welfare.
Logistical challenge
Logistics planning began in late 2024, involving teamwork from across the Cathay teams in Hong Kong and Europe, including cargo planning and flight operations. To minimise stress and travel time for the horses, the team designated two rendezvous points for boarding: Liège Airport in Belgium, a hub for horses journeying from across Europe; and London Heathrow."

Underage sex and child marriage remain a contentious issue in Malaysia, with more latter cases reported in impoverished Malay communities, driven by religious, cultural, and socio-economic factors.
The legal minimum marriage age is 18 in Malaysia. However, girls aged 16 or younger are allowed to be married under sharia and customary laws, with some requiring judicial consent depending on the age.
This legal loophole is often exploited by families, especially in poorer families in Kelantan, who see early marriage as a solution to ease financial hardship or preserve their honour.
On Wednesday, Kelantan state police chief Mohd Yusoff Mamat said that there had been a spike in sexual cases involving minors to 252 last year from 206 in 2023, with social media playing a pernicious role.
The most shocking was a sexual case involving a 15-year-old girl and her 11-year-old cousin, which resulted in her pregnancy."

“There will be new opportunities for Hong Kong as an international financial centre,” he said at the Citi Hong Kong Macro Investor Conference 2025 on Thursday. “Given the current geopolitical landscape, Hong Kong is naturally becoming the preferred fundraising market for mainland companies.”
The government would encourage quality issuers from the Middle East and Southeast Asia to consider dual-primary or secondary listings in the city, he added, noting that more than 100 major companies were waiting to make their initial public offerings (IPOs) on the Hong Kong stock exchange.

Hong Kong banks will be granted powers to trace and flag suspicious accounts linked to scams by exchanging information with police, putting questionable transactions on hold and having officers meet clients in person.
The Monetary Authority on Thursday revealed the new system for information exchange as a part of joint efforts with police to clamp down on scams and money laundering amid a rise in deception cases in recent years.
Raymond Chan King-wang, the executive director of the city’s de facto central bank, said the force would share with banks the suspicious phone numbers and email addresses already stored in Scameter, a search engine platform launched by police in 2022.
The banks will then flag corresponding accounts that match the information to review their activities, monitor future transactions and report the newly identified suspicious accounts to police.
“Through this continuous cycle, we hope to find out and uproot the mule accounts from all the banks,” Chan said, referring to accounts that had been sold or lent to criminals to help transfer or process illegally obtained funds.
The executive director said that once bank staff were alerted to a transaction made to a suspicious account, they would contact account holders and tell them that a pending transaction would be temporarily put on hold. The clients would then be asked to go to the bank for a meeting."

With tit-for-tat tariffs escalating the US-China trade war to never-before-seen levels in the past week, their high-stakes game of one-upmanship could turn into a marathon that tests the long-term resilience of economic and industrial systems, according to prominent Chinese economists.
Meanwhile, officials from China’s commerce and foreign ministries reiterated the nation’s stance in the stand-off – that China would “fight to the end” if the US insists on a tariff war, while welcoming dialogue on a footing of mutual respect.
As the trade war endures with no end in sight, economists have suggested a stronger dose of government stimulus to unleash domestic demand, noting that doing so would be of the utmost importance to China in navigating these turbulent times.
“What China and the US are competing for now is economic resilience,” said Zheng Yongnian, dean of the School of Public Policy at the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s Shenzhen campus (CUHK-Shenzhen).
“Our goal should be to build an industrial system with strong economic resilience; only in this way can we secure a dominant position in the long-term competition with the US,” he was quoted as saying by Xiakedao, a social media account run by overseas-edition staff from party mouthpiece People’s Daily, on Wednesday.

He does not wear the rubber for kicks. It is, for him, a sort of therapy.
Since childhood, Baldessari, now 47, has struggled with hyperactivity. A difficult upbringing only exacerbated his inability to process complex emotions and focus on tasks in front of him.
When a girlfriend mentioned a technique described in her friend’s university course on sexual deviance, it struck a chord. She explained how BDSM practitioners block certain forms of sensory information to heighten others.
He decided to try it, hoping it would help him focus. When he pulled on a latex suit for the first time, it felt entirely natural, he says.
“I can’t really hear anything, can’t smell anything and when I’m wearing the gloves, my sense of touch is minimised. I can focus entirely on flavour.”"

With Hong Kong’s champion galloper Romantic Warrior absent from the QE II Cup after an arduous campaign in the Middle East, McDonald was without a ride in the HK$28 million feature until connections of Prognosis swooped.
The Kiwi rider will also team up with four-time Group One winner Lucky Sweynesse in his return from injury in the Group One Chairman’s Sprint Prize (1,200m), while he will again have undeniable claims aboard star miler Voyage Bubble in the Group One Champions Mile at Sha Tin’s second biggest meeting of the year.
McDonald has seen plenty of Prognosis, having relegated the unlucky galloper to second in three Group Ones – the past two QE II Cups when he was triumphant aboard Romantic Warrior and November’s Cox Plate (2040m) at Moonee Valley when he booted home Via Sistina.
“I’ve faced him three times on Romantic Warrior and we’re 3-0 and once with Via Sistina, so we’re 4-0 against him,” McDonald said.
“He’s always been the horse to beat against those top horses, so I’ve done my research on him over the years and hopefully we can get the best out of him there.
“If he runs up to his form when he faced Romantic Warrior, then he’s going to be right in this because there’s no Romantic Warrior this year. The champ’s not there so it’s anyone’s race. If he puts his best foot forward, he can win the race for sure.”
A three-time Group Two winner in Japan, Prognosis has been plagued by slow starts and bad luck in running – including in his latest appearance in Hong Kong.
The Mitsumasa Nakauchida-trained galloper was only beaten a neck by Romantic Warrior in last year’s QE II Cup after starting slowly and sustaining a mid-race move out wide.
McDonald will bid for his second elite-level triumph aboard Lucky Sweynesse after booting home Manfred Man Ka-leung’s stable star in the Group One Queen’s Silver Jubilee Cup (1,400m) in 2023.
However, Lucky Sweynesse faces a big test at his first run since fracturing his left fore cannon bone in his Group Two Sprint Cup (1,200m) success 12 months ago.
Also standing in his way is superstar sprinter Ka Ying Rising, who will chase a fourth Group One triumph and 12th win in a row.
“Obviously it’s his first run back so we watch and learn a bit, but he’s Hong Kong’s champion sprinter from a year or two ago,” McDonald said.
“He seems to have trialled brilliantly and he gave me a good feel when I was up there doing my little stint. Even though he ran last in a trial with me, he felt good so as long as he’s nice and forward for his first-up showing against the champ, Ka Ying Rising, I’m sure he’ll give a good account of himself.”
Despite taking on a strong field headlined by Australian star Mr Brightside, Voyage Bubble will be the one to beat when he bids for a fifth straight victory in the Champions Mile.
McDonald and Ricky Yiu Poon-fai’s outstanding galloper have been a dominant force this season, racking up wins in Group Ones the Hong Kong Mile, Stewards’ Cup (1,600m) and Gold Cup (2,000m).
“The Bubble’s bloody airborne,” McDonald said. “He’s had an unbelievably good preparation.
“It looks a very, very competitive mile but I wouldn’t swap him for anything because he’s so consistent, he’s got a great racing style and he seems in career-best form. I can’t see the mile being any problem – obviously 2,000m back to a mile but he’s got speed. He’s just a confident horse.”"

It features ceiling-mounted thermal sensors that can detect hidden cameras in real time, as well as monitors designed to identify attempts to film over partition walls, creating what officials called a highly secure monitoring set-up, JoongAng Daily reported on Tuesday.
To deter illegal recording, warning stickers have been placed inside and outside the restroom.
“We plan to create a safer environment for visitors by gradually expanding the installation of these permanent illegal filming detection systems to other public restrooms within the palace,” Kim Eung-rye, head of the Changgyeonggung Palace Office, told JoongAng Daily.
The installation highlights South Korea’s ongoing struggle with illegal filming, a pervasive issue fuelled by the widespread availability of small, easily concealed cameras known as molka.

Two of India’s largest telecoms operators, Reliance Jio and its rival Bharti Airtel, signed separate deals with SpaceX last month to bring the Starlink internet service to the country. The announcement came soon after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States in February where he met Musk.
Industry executives said the influence of the world’s richest man with the White House had likely nudged the Indian government to re-evaluate a Starlink deal that had been pending for months. Trump, who has been pressuring New Delhi to reduce its import tariffs, announced a 26 per cent tariff on India last week before he reversed the decision on Wednesday by ordering a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs affecting dozens of Washington’s trading partners including the South Asian country.
Indian officials are hoping to address Washington’s concerns on the trade surplus enjoyed by India through a bilateral deal, the first tranche of which is expected to be ready by September.
The US has been seeking greater access to India’s huge market. Delhi has indicated that it is willing to give greater access to US firms in certain sectors as a precursor to the trade deal, according to analysts.
The move by Starlink to sign partnership deals with Jio and Airtel to explore opportunities in India’s booming telecommunications market has surprised analysts due to past differences between the Indian companies and Musk. For instance, Reliance, Jio’s parent company, in November urged Delhi to rethink its plan to allocate satellite broadband spectrum instead of holding an auction. Starlink has favoured Delhi’s plan to allocate the spectrum."

I Squared Capital’s potential takeover offer for Hong Kong internet provider HKBN is facing hurdles, as it tries to convince China’s sovereign wealth fund of the merits of the deal and a competing state-backed bidder built a significant stake.
Rival suitor China Mobile agreed to acquire a 15.5 per cent holding in HKBN from buyout firm TPG at HK$5.23 per share, the same as its planned offer price for the whole company, according to a Hong Kong exchange filing Wednesday. China Mobile said it plans to complete the purchase no later than Nov. 28.
The latest deal, worth HK$1.2 billion (US$154.6 million), effectively gives state-backed China Mobile a blocking stake that could prevent another suitor from getting full control of HKBN and taking it private.
Miami-based I Squared already owns broadband operator HGC Global Communications, where sovereign fund China Investment Corp is a minority investor, and wants to combine it with HKBN. So far, I Squared has not been able to secure approval from CIC to move forward with a formal offer for HKBN, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The US infrastructure investor has been working to line up more equity co-investors for its potential offer, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. It’s also been analysing the possible antitrust implications of a deal, according to the people.
HKBN said in an emailed statement Thursday that its board is still evaluating its options, and negotiations with China Mobile and I Squared are ongoing.

South Korean authorities are investigating a claim, made by one of two Chinese high school students apprehended for illegally filming military aircraft, that his father is a member of China’s public security bureau.
An official familiar with the investigation told The Chosun Daily that nearly 100 images of aircraft taking off and landing were recovered from the students’ DSLR camera and smartphones.
They had positioned themselves on farmland several hundred metres from the base when a resident reported their activities to police. Investigators said the photos did not include interior shots of the facility, and no telephoto lens had been used.
Nonetheless, officials suspect the students may have acted with intent. “Given that they began photographing strategic assets and key installations almost immediately after entering the country, their actions appear premeditated,” an investigative source told The Chosun Daily.
Before arriving in Suwon, the students are said to have visited Osan Air Base in Pyeongtaek, where they filmed US Air Force F-35 stealth fighters – a next-generation aircraft exported only to close American allies and closely watched by Beijing."

A foster mother in the US state of Missouri has been charged with child abuse and endangerment as authorities investigate whether she traded an adopted daughter to someone in Texas for a monkey and mistreated other children in her care.
The 70-year-old woman from Winfield has been jailed on US$250,000 bond since her arrest over the weekend, with her next court appearance set for April 15. No lawyer is listed for the woman in online court records. The 1,500-person town Winfield is about 72km (45 miles) northwest of downtown St. Louis.
Prosecutors wrote in asking for a cash-only bond that the girl’s mother was a foster or adoptive parent to more than 100 children. The filing said they had received information that some of those children also had suffered similar physical and emotional abuse.
Associated Press is not identifying the woman in an effort not to identity her child.
The girl at the centre of the case is in her teens. She told authorities she was beaten with wooden trim, shoes and a paddle, a detective with the Lincoln county sheriff’s office wrote in the probable cause statement. The girl said she tried to tell people what was happening but no one believed her.
In February, a deputy who was working as a school resource officer in Missouri was contacted about the girl missing classes, the probable cause statement said. While investigating, the deputy was told of a rumour that the girl was traded for an exotic animal to someone in Texas.
The deputy asked authorities in Texas to check on the girl, and she was returned to Missouri, where child welfare officials had got a tip several months earlier that the girl was being abused."

The erratic tariff announcements by US President Donald Trump have created an environment where it is “impossible for anyone to do business”, according to a Hong Kong industry leader, who has said the shifting policies mean local firms must “wait and see” to decide on their next steps.
Steve Chuang Tzu-hsiung, chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, shared his concerns on Thursday amid an escalating trade war between the United States and China, as a 125 per cent import tariff by the Trump administration kicked in on Wednesday for most Chinese goods while “reciprocal” levies on other markets were paused for 90 days.
“The current tariffs have already reached a point where it’s impossible for anyone to do business,” Chuang, who heads one of the four biggest business chambers in the city, said of the levy’s paralysing effect on local manufacturers.
“Whether [the tariff percentage] continues to 125, 34 or 84 – it really doesn’t matter any more … it’s no longer a question of price, it’s a question of a trade war.
“The biggest challenge for Hong Kong businesses now is, if you continue production in mainland China, do you ship or not? Will the American buyers cancel?”
Chuang said many Hong Kong companies operated under “free on board”, or FOB, agreements, meaning sellers were responsible for loading goods onto vessels or other transport at the designated port of shipment."

US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said it was up to Iran to decide whether the recent US movement of B-2 bombers was a message to Tehran, as he voiced hope that US-Iran negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear programme could be resolved peacefully.
As many as six B-2 bombers relocated in March to a US-British military base on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, US officials said, amid a US bombing campaign in Yemen and mounting tensions with Iran.
There are only 20 B-2 bombers in the air force’s inventory so they are usually used sparingly.
Experts said that puts the B-2s, which have stealth technology and are equipped to carry the heaviest US bombs and nuclear weapons, in an ideal position to operate in the Middle East.
Asked if the B-2s were meant to send a message to Iran, Hegseth said: “We’ll let them decide.”
“It’s a great asset … it sends a message to everybody,” he told reporters during a trip to Panama.
“President Trump’s been clear … Iran should not have a nuclear bomb,” he said. “We very much hope – the president is focused on doing that peacefully.”"

It is possible for Apple to move iPhone production to America, but it would almost double the cost of making the device while creating logistical headaches, according to Bank of America.
“iPhone cost can increase 25 per cent purely on higher labour cost in the US,” BofA analysts led by Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.
While the tech giant can find domestic labour for assembly, a “significant portion” of parts used in manufacturing the iPhone would still be assembled in China and imported to the US, they added. Assuming Apple has to pay reciprocal tariffs on those imports, its total cost would rise 90% or more, they estimated.
The estimate comes as President Donald Trump zeros in on China for his trade fight. The Trump administration paused its reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries for 90 days, but increased its duties on China to 125 per cent. Meanwhile, China slapped 84 per cent retaliatory levies on American goods.
Apple shares are soaring on the news, up more than 10 per cent for their best day since July 2020. But the stock has taken a beating this year, losing 23 per cent, and is down 14 per cent since Trump’s tariff announcement on April 2, erasing US$479 billion in market capitalisation."

Easter is the most important festival for Christians, as they commemorate the resurrection of Jesus in church services, vigils and parades.
It is also a time for fun, with Easter egg hunts. Food plays an important role, too.
In the Philippines, people enjoy bilo-bilo, a sweet coconut soup made with sweet potato, jackfruit, tapioca pearls and rice balls.
In Switzerland and Germany, Osterfladen – a rice or semolina pudding, baked in a pastry shell – is popular during Easter, while in Mexico bacalao, a salted cod stew made with potatoes, carrots and tomatoes, is often eaten on Good Friday.
Rosca de pascua – the name means “Easter ring” and comes from its shape – is a sweet, brioche-like bread decorated with pastry cream, nuts and fruits that is popular in Argentina. Greeks traditionally eat mayeritsa, a rich soup made from lamb intestines.
And let’s not forget hot cross buns, the soft and sticky glazed spiced bread dotted with raisins that have long been baked in Britain and become popular in New Zealand, South Africa and Australia.
The one universally popular Easter treat is eggs. Easter festivities often include the decoration of eggs, a tradition that dates back to the 13th century. Today many prefer their eggs in chocolate form."

While US President Donald Trump’s Wednesday announcement of a 90-day pause on the punitive levies he had aimed at most other nations is “a tactical retreat”, analysts said “no one should relax” as this does not augur any shift in his overall objectives.
“When the dust settles, we’ll be in a much higher tariff world than we were when Trump walked into office,” he said.
“This is a scary moment. You’re also talking about the supply chain completely out of whack now in the coming weeks and months,” said Victor Gao, vice-president of the Beijing-based think tank Centre for China and Globalisation. “It will cause a lot of pain not only to China and the US, but to other countries.”
A report by ING noted the current tariffs on Chinese products could provide tax revenue of US$835 billion, calling the current situation “not only chaotic, [but] crazy.”
However, the financial services firm added that figure would drop to zero if “China simply stops exporting” the way several European companies had already announced."

Hong Kong national security police took away the parents of wanted US-based activist Frances Hui Wing-ting for questioning on Thursday, the Post learned, after Washington imposed a new round of sanctions on local officials for what it called “transnational repression”.
A source said that Hui’s mother and father were escorted to two police stations in Sha Tin. They left the stations in the afternoon.
Hui, who left the city in 2020 and is now based in the United States, is among 19 activists with HK$1 million (US$128,860) bounties on their heads for allegedly violating the Beijing-imposed national security law in Hong Kong.
She is wanted on suspicion of colluding with a foreign country to endanger national security. Police have accused her of repeatedly calling on foreign countries to impose sanctions, blockades and other actions against China.
Hui was among seven wanted activists whose passports were cancelled by authorities last December.
In 2022, Hui was granted political asylum in the US. She now serves as a policy and advocacy coordinator at the Washington-based Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, which is considered “anti-China” by city authorities."

The orders for beach chairs, scooters, air conditioners and other merchandise from multiple Amazon vendors were halted after Trump’s April 2 announcement that he planned to levy tariffs on more than 180 countries and territories, including China, Vietnam and Thailand, the people said. The timing of the cancellations, which had no warning, led the vendors to suspect it was a response to tariffs.
An Amazon representative declined to comment. The company identified international trade disputes as a risk factor in its annual report released in February. “China-based suppliers provide significant portions of our components and finished goods,” the company said.
It was unclear how widespread the cancellations were and how many types of merchandise they affected.

Hong Kong’s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are finding it more difficult to repay debt and expect slower business growth this year, though they still plan to hire staff and invest in technology, according to a survey released on Thursday.
Around 57 per cent of Hong Kong respondents said they expected their business to grow in 2025, down from 69 per cent in 2024, according to the 16th annual edition of CPA Australia’s Asia-Pacific Small Business Survey for 2024 and 2025.
In 2024, 65 per cent of the surveyed Hong Kong SMEs reported business growth – the strongest performance since 2017 – an increase from 57 per cent in 2023.
The survey collected views from 4,236 SMEs in November and December in 11 markets across the Asia-Pacific region, including Hong Kong, Singapore, mainland China and Australia.
“Many SMEs are facing multiple challenges, including US tariffs, tightening financing conditions and increased market competition,” said Cliff Ip, a councillor at the Greater China Division of CPA Australia, a group representing the accountancy industry.
He said that when the survey was conducted, Donald Trump had been elected US president, so respondents expected Washington to impose tariffs on many markets. This may explain why Hong Kong respondents expected a slowdown.
Hong Kong’s confidence ranked the eighth among the 11 markets; higher than Australia, where only 55 per cent of respondents expected business growth in 2025. Taiwan was at 52 per cent and New Zealand stood at the bottom at 47 per cent."

A previous version of this story carried the headline “Babies born in winter less likely to become obese adults, Japan study finds.” This has been corrected to reflect that the researchers’ conclusion pertains to babies conceived in winter, not born.
Babies who are conceived in winter are less likely to gain weight in adulthood, according to a group of researchers led by a Japanese university, whose findings may lead to new ways of preventing obesity and lifestyle-related diseases.
The Tohoku University-led team examined two types of body fat – white fat, which stores energy, and brown fat, which produces heat by consuming energy – in the study published in the Nature Metabolism magazine on Tuesday, according to a report by The Japan Times newspaper.
When body temperatures fall, brown fat induces the body to burn fat. As such, individuals who have more active brown fat would find it easier to keep their weight down.
For their study, the researchers analysed the brown fat of 356 Japanese men between the ages of 18 and 29 who were categorised based on the months they were conceived.
They found that brown fat was more active among the men who were conceived during the colder months between October 17 and April 15 than those conceived during the warmer months.
The team also looked at where the men’s mothers were living and the weather then and noted that higher brown fat activity was linked to lower external temperatures before fertilisation and a bigger difference in daily temperature."

OpenAI countersued Elon Musk on Wednesday, citing a pattern of harassment by Musk and asking a federal judge to stop Musk from any “further unlawful and unfair action” against OpenAI in a court case over the future structure of the firm that helped launch the AI revolution.
Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman co-founded OpenAI in 2015, but Musk left before the company became a technology star. Recently Musk, who went on to create his own AI firm, xAI, in 2023, has tried to prevent the ChatGPT maker from transitioning to a for-profit model, culminating in the current court case.
In order for OpenAI to secure the entire US$40 billion of its current fundraising round, the company must complete its transition by the end of the year.
“Through press attacks, malicious campaigns broadcast to Musk’s more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he controls, a pretextual demand for corporate records, harassing legal claims, and a sham bid for OpenAI’s assets, Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI,” the company wrote in a filing in Musk’s existing lawsuit against OpenAI in US District Court for the Northern District of California.
OpenAI asked the judge to stop Musk from any further attacks, as well as be “held responsible for the damage he has already caused.” The two parties are set to begin a jury trial in spring next year. Musk’s legal team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a post on X, the social media platform which Musk owns, OpenAI said: “Elon’s nonstop actions against us are just bad-faith tactics to slow down OpenAI and seize control of the leading AI innovations for his personal benefit.”
Musk’s xAI last month acquired X in a deal that values the social media company at US$33 billion and allows the value of his artificial intelligence firm to be shared with co-investors in X."

As Donald Trump’s sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs took effect just after midnight on Wednesday, the president was watching the bond market.
Long-term yields were soaring. The 10-year Treasury saw the biggest three-day jump since 2001. The president was confronting a worst-case scenario: voters who had returned him to the White House because of inflation now faced both increased prices and higher borrowing costs.
“People were getting a little queasy,” Trump said.
The president had for days been debating whether to fully push ahead with the tariff programme, which resulted from a frenetic meeting with his economic aides just hours before he rolled out the announcement in the White House Rose Garden last week.
China, which met Trump’s tariffs with equal retaliatory measures, was the only country not offered a reprieve; instead, the president again raised tariffs on the world’s second-largest economy."

As a wave of tariff hikes from US President Donald Trump washes on China’s shores – with a combined 125 per cent in import duties placed on all Chinese goods – Beijing has reported a drop in consumer prices while many exporters look inward to find new sources of revenue.
The national consumer price index (CPI), a key gauge of inflation, fell 0.1 per cent year on year last month, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Thursday.
“Deflationary pressure is persistent with both CPI and PPI in negative territory,” said Zhang Zhiwei, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. “Bilateral trade between China and the US is set to drop sharply soon due to the triple digit tariffs.”
But Zhang added that the Chinese government was likely to launch a stimulus to boost domestic demand amid the escalating trade war, which could mitigate the deflationary pressure."

Across much of Southeast Asia, political parties rely on charisma or dynastic clout to field candidates. In Singapore, however, it is the resignation of senior civil servants and military brass that often sets the stage for entry into politics – especially amid the beating of electoral drums.
The discussion around such high-ranking figures vacating their posts in an election year usually involves when and where they will be fielded by the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP).
With the polls expected this month or the next, several recently resigned public servants have been spotted on the ground dressed in signature PAP white over the past week. They include the ex-army chief and a former second permanent secretary at the trade ministry, who left their posts earlier this year.
The long rule of the PAP has socialised many Singaporeans on what makes for desirable candidates, which includes academic credentials, professional qualifications and technocratic ability, according to Eugene Tan, a law professor from the Singapore Management University.
“This is overlaid by the emphasis on meritocracy, denoted by the best and brightest in the politics arena. As such, parties have to show how their candidates match up,” he said.
The PAP has governed Singapore since 1959, before the country gained independence in 1965, making it one of the longest undisrupted ruling parties in modern democracies.
It has been a long-standing practice within the PAP to tap into the public service and military for its talent pool, earning its reputation as a party of technocrats.
Prime Minister Lawrence Wong left his post as chief executive of the Energy Market Authority before being fielded by the PAP in West Coast in 2011. Wong’s predecessor Lee Hsien Loong, son of founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, was a brigadier-general in the armed forces before joining politics in 1984."

But how exactly would such an authority expedite development? What considerations are involved? More importantly, how would it attract investment and address funding shortages in an era of geopolitical tensions and economic downturns?
But the Northern Metropolis is a massive undertaking involving multiple policy bureaus. For instance, the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau is tasked with charting the course for innovation and technology development, as well as identifying the land needs. Meanwhile, the Development Bureau prepares the land and the Transport and Logistics Bureau provides transport infrastructure.
From conception to implementation, such projects still often take over a decade. In a fast-changing world where technology evolves rapidly, if bureaus continue to operate in silos – making decisions independently before passing the project along – the development risks becoming outdated even before the work begins.
Establishing a development authority as a statutory body could address this. It would oversee the planning, design, construction and operation of Northern Metropolis projects, minimising redundant processes. By aligning transport infrastructure with the new development area’s timeline, the authority could unlock land potential promptly, boosting investor confidence."

The move comes just days after BGI Group, a leading Chinese genomics company, suddenly lost access to its own Microsoft services, including the Outlook email system and OneDrive cloud storage platform. Two employees of the company noted that the company was caught off guard by the sudden service suspension, which forced it to scramble for alternatives, including the emergency use of the WPS Office suite, from Beijing-based Kingsoft. The termination of service was first reported by Nikkei Asia.

Global emissions from electricity consumption tied to artificial intelligence (AI) chip manufacturing surged last year, driven by heavy reliance on fossil fuels in Asia’s leading production technology hubs, according to Greenpeace East Asia.
Electricity consumption for AI chip production more than tripled to about 984 gigawatt hours (GWh), resulting in a fourfold increase to 453,600 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, Greenpeace said in a report on Thursday. Major hubs like Taiwan, South Korea and Japan face big climate and pollution risks if they keep relying on dirty fuels for power, it added.
“While fabless hardware companies like Nvidia and AMD are reaping billions from the AI boom, they are neglecting the climate impact of their supply chains in East Asia,” co-author Katrin Wu said in a statement. “AI chipmaking is being leveraged to justify new fossil fuel capacity in Taiwan and South Korea – demand that could, and should, be met by renewable energy sources.”
Demand for AI chips boomed as ChatGPT started an evolution in AI services and sparked a rise of Chinese rivals, banking on processors specially designed to perform big tasks like machine learning. These chips are significantly faster and more efficient than traditional computer processing units.
The global semiconductor market could grow 15 per cent this year, driven by the strong demand for advanced chips to handle AI workloads, according to market researcher IDC. The AI market could reach US$780 billion to US$990 billion in 2027, according to consultancy Bain & Co."

As part of his daily routine, Hong Kong retiree Yiu Po-tai, 81, has to rummage through a plastic bag full of medicine and gulp down 16 different pills to manage his chronic illnesses.
“I suffer from hypertension and had shingles two years ago, but I still have not recovered from the nerve pain,” said the former construction worker, who lives alone in a subdivided flat in Sham Shui Po.
“I had a stroke 10 years ago … and my face was paralysed twice around the time I had shingles.”
To manage nerve pain in his arms, Yiu also took medicine from doctors in mainland China, where service was faster, and from a local pharmacy, besides prescriptions in Hong Kong.
Yiu’s experience is not uncommon for many local patients with chronic diseases. They often use various medications prescribed by different doctors, taking pills without realising that some may be duplicates of others they use or have adverse effects. Fortunately for Yiu, a social worker noticed his situation and took him to a community pharmacy where a pharmacist cut his medication to 13 pills.
Non-government organisations currently operate a number of community pharmacies, providing medication management consultations, a dispensing service and referrals to other healthcare resources. Around 190 pharmacies serve as drug collection points for residents and those in homes for the elderly who use public hospital services.
The government will also launch a community pharmacy programme in the fourth quarter next year, with each of Hong Kong’s 18 districts to get at least four to five facilities."

Even if we leave aside that particular pen, the paperwork that follows will mainly be processed with tools sourced from Chinese factories, which now face an accumulated American tariff of around 125 per cent.
US trade data reveals a startling reality: about 85 per cent of the pens and pencils in the United States are made in China. In 2022 alone, Americans bought US$430 million worth of pens from Chinese suppliers. Even leading brands such as Bic and Paper Mate rely on Chinese components.
The mountains of paperwork unleashed by the president’s wild economic gamble will become much more expensive after this week, and there is no real alternative in sight. China claims 80 per cent of the global market share of stationery.
It is not just the writing instruments. When Trump’s deeply religious faithful go to church to pray for a trade war victory, the Bibles in their hands are most likely to have been printed… again in China!
Amity Printing Company in Nanjing, China is the world’s largest Bible producer. Since 1987, it has printed over 200 million copies of “the good book”, all for export. About half of these are estimated to be sold to the American market. According to US International Trade Commission data, atheist China accounts for 70 to 80 per cent of America’s religious book imports."

Senior members of the Yamaguchi-gumi on Monday took the highly unusual step of visiting police in Hyogo prefecture to announce the end of hostilities with its splinter factions, and requested the lifting of their “designated violent conflict group” classification, which had restricted their operations since 2015.
The rare visit marked a symbolic end to the gang war triggered by a major split within the Yamaguchi-gumi, which has long been headquartered in Kobe and remains the country’s largest crime syndicate.
Jake Adelstein, author of Tokyo Vice: An American Reporter on the Police Beat in Japan and a noted expert on Japan’s underworld, said the Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi – the main breakaway faction – had been “decimated” by infighting and a wave of defections from disillusioned gangsters.
“This has been coming for some time as the Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi lost ground and the fight became very one-sided,” Adelstein told This Week in Asia. “It got to the point where they had no power to push back.”
He added that Kunio Inoue, who set up the Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi in August 2015 to rival the main group, had “been living in fear of his life for some time now and probably sees this as an opportunity to escape from that threat with some pride left intact”."

The team, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Metal Research, were able to alter the steel’s internal structure by twisting it – like a towel – to make it stronger and more resilient, the paper said.
The modification not only more than doubled the material’s yield strength, it also increased its resistance to the accumulated damage of metal fatigue by a factor of up to 10,000, according to the study which was published on April 4.
Potential applications may include undersea pipelines and engine components such as crankshafts and connecting rods that are exposed to pressure. The breakthrough could also offer technological support to high-end equipment manufacturing and engineering sectors.
In an interview with state broadcaster CCTV, research team leader Professor Lu Lei said that there was no visible change to the material’s surface before and after processing, but “its internal structure [had] transformed”.
“The skeletal structure is just one three-hundredth the diameter of a human hair, but it plays a significant role when bearing pressure,” she said."

US President Donald Trump threatened to use military action against Iran if it were to try and acquire a nuclear weapon, as negotiators are set to meet Saturday to discuss the stand-off over Tehran’s nuclear programme.
Trump told reporters he would “absolutely” consider using military action “if necessary” during an event in the Oval Office on Wednesday. Trump added that Israel would “very much be involved, the leader of that”.
The president added that he had an internal deadline for the negotiations to yield results.
“We don’t have much time because we’re not going to let them have a nuclear weapon,” Trump said. “And we’re going to let them thrive, I want Iran to be great. The only thing that they can’t have is a nuclear weapon.”
The high-level talks set for Oman this weekend will be the first time since September 2022 that the US and Iran are taking part in formal nuclear talks.

Foie gras – a delicious delicacy to some, blatant animal cruelty to others – requires ducks and geese to be force-fed high-calorie food through a tube into their stomachs.
This excruciating process causes the liver to swell significantly and its fat content to rise. In many countries, this practice is banned.
Now, a German-Danish research team has presented a method to produce a foie-gras-like pâté without the painful force-feeding.
“It has always been a goal to reproduce the taste and texture of real foie gras while keeping animal welfare in mind,” explains team leader Thomas Vilgis, from the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz, Germany.
The physicist, who is also an amateur chef, wanted his team to not only imitate the taste of duck and goose foie gras but also to replicate its consistency and mouthfeel when eaten.
This has been achieved after five years of research, Vilgis says. “The foie gras we produce is indistinguishable from the conventional product.”"

Contemporary Amperex Technology, or CATL, the world’s largest maker of electric vehicle batteries, plans to go ahead with its Hong Kong listing this quarter despite turmoil in the stock market, according to sources close to the deal.
CATL intends to proceed with the listing in the next three months, although some details, including the amount to be raised, have not yet been finalised, the sources told the Post.
The Shenzhen-listed company filed for a listing in Hong Kong in February, which was approved by the mainland’s regulator in March. The company has not disclosed the fundraising target, but bankers expect it to be around US$5 billion, which would make it the largest since Kuaishou Technology raised US$6.2 billion from its initial public offering (IPO) in January 2021.
CATL’s fundraising will be a shot in the arm for Hong Kong’s stock market. The benchmark Hang Seng Index slumped 13.2 per cent on Monday, its biggest one-day decline since October 1997, after the US imposed hefty tariffs on Chinese exports.

The back-and-forth tariffs between the US and China have led to uncertainty in the market, which may force some of the 178 companies that have filed IPO applications with the Hong Kong stock exchange to delay their listing plans, according to market observers.
“It is inevitable that IPOs and other fundraising activities on the stock market may slow down in the second quarter as a result of the recent market uncertainties,” Edward Au Chun-hing, the president of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, said in a media briefing on Wednesday."

Former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, accusing the social media company of undermining national security and briefing China on US artificial intelligence efforts to grow its business there.
“We are engaged in a high-stakes AI arms race against China. And during my time at Meta, company executives lied about what they were doing with the Chinese Communist Party to employees, shareholders, Congress, and the American public,” Wynn-Williams said in her prepared testimony.
Her book Careless People, an explosive insider account of her time at the social media giant, sold 60,000 copies in its first week and reached the top 10 on Amazon’s bestseller list amid efforts by Meta to discredit the work and stop her from talking about her experiences at the company.
Meta used a “campaign of threats and intimidation” to silence the former executive, said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, during the hearing.
Wynn-Williams served as director of global public policy at Facebook, now Meta, from 2011 until she was fired in 2017.
“Throughout those seven years, I saw Meta executives repeatedly undermine US national security and betray American values. They did these things in secret to win favour with Beijing and build an US$18 billion dollar business in China,” she said in her prepared remarks."

US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday floated the idea of US troops returning to Panama to “secure” its strategically vital canal, a suggestion quickly rejected by the country’s government.
During a visit to Panama, Hegseth suggested that “by invitation” the United States could “revive” military bases or naval air stations and rotate deployments of US troops to an isthmus the United States invaded 35 years ago.
Since coming to power in January, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 per cent of US container traffic and five per cent of world trade.
His administration has vowed to “take back” control of the interoceanic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999.
Hegseth on Wednesday suggested the slew of former US military bases that dot Panama could again be used to host US troops.
He said a deal signed with Panama this week was an “opportunity to revive, whether it’s the military base, naval air station, locations where US troops can work with Panamanian troops to enhance capabilities and cooperate in a rotational way”."

In China, officials called the allegations “totally unfounded”.
The Ukrainian accusation and Chinese denial come as the US strives to secure a ceasefire in the more than three-year war.
President Volodymyr Zelensky announced Tuesday that the Ukrainian military had captured two Chinese men fighting alongside the Russian army on Ukrainian soil. It was the first time Ukraine had made such a claim about Chinese fighters in the war.
On Wednesday, Zelensky said he was willing to exchange the two prisoners of war for Ukrainian soldiers held captive in Russia.
Without providing evidence, Zelensky said officials in Beijing were aware of Russia’s campaign to recruit Chinese mercenaries. He stopped short of saying the Chinese government authorised the mercenaries’ involvement in Ukraine.

China and Mexico are the leading players in a robust and sophisticated global financial system supporting the fentanyl trade, the US Treasury Department claimed Wednesday in a report on bank secrecy that could provide more ammunition as Washington targets Beijing in a potentially devastating trade war.
The picture that develops – from the compilation of filings that banks are required to submit on potentially shady transactions – includes a resilient and shadowy network of wire transfers, social media marketing, casinos, cash transactions, money laundering, e-commerce, call centres and illegal online pharmacies, all to finance the deadly opioid trade.
“Hong Kong-based companies were often reported in conjunction with [mainland]-based subjects conducting similar financial activity or operating within the same financial networks,” the report said.

Amid a global market meltdown, US President Donald Trump announced a further tariff hike on imports from China – to 125 per cent – on Wednesday, while placing a 90-day pause on punitive levies aimed at most other nations.
Markets surged on the news, with the benchmark S&P 500 index rising almost 10 per cent following Trump’s early afternoon announcement, reversing a nearly 20 per cent drop over the course of four previous trading sessions.
Speaking to reporters after the announcement, Trump said that leading up to the pause in his so-called “reciprocal” tariffs, some 75 countries had been entreating him to make a deal – and he predicted that China under President Xi Jinping would follow suit soon enough.
“China wants to make a deal. They just don’t know how quite to go about it. You know, it’s one of those things, quite proud people,” he said. “President Xi is a proud man. I know him very well. They don’t know quite how to go about it, but they’ll figure it out. They’re in the process of figuring it out.”
Trump said he did not expect to raise the levies on Chinese imports above 125 per cent. “I can’t imagine it. I don’t think we’ll have to do it more,” he said. “No, I don’t see that.”
Asked whether he was trying to form a coalition against China on trade, the president said “no”, blaming former US president Joe Biden’s administration for the state of global trade. “There are a lot of things I’d like China to do,” he added.
Trump also said talks were moving along over the ownership TikTok. The US Congress passed a law last year that forced its Chinese owner, ByteDance, to either sell the app or face a US ban, although Trump has extended the deadline to allow for an eventual deal."

The prosecution authority declined to give more detail on the case or whether it concerned the small population of Uygurs living in Sweden or groups elsewhere.
The man, whose nationality was also not disclosed, is in custody in the Swedish capital, court documents showed.
“The man is suspected of having illegally collected information and intelligence on people in the Uygur environment on behalf of the Chinese intelligence service,” Prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist said in a statement earlier on Wednesday.

Hong Kong prison authorities have for the first time produced short films based on the stories of current and former inmates convicted of offences related to the city’s anti-government protests to educate young people about not running afoul of the law.
Acting security chief Michael Cheuk Hau-yip told a seminar on Wednesday attended by more than 1,600 secondary school pupils from 29 schools that many young offenders who had broken the national security law had been misinformed, incited or acted under misguided heroism to challenge social order.
He pointed to the 30-minute film Momentary Glory, which will be released on the social media platforms of the Correctional Services Department and Education Bureau on National Security Education Day on April 15 along with another one, Unfailing Love.
“This short film was adapted from a real case. The story described a youth who, under peer pressure and negativity in society, was blinded by illusory conceit. He offended against the national security law and ended up in prison,” Cheuk said.
Momentary Glory follows the story of Yiu Chi-man, a troubled young man who was forced to abandon his university studies to support his family.
Yiu is shown riding a motorcycle after answering two friends’ calls to “handle” an unnamed matter. In the film, one friend hands Yiu a folded black flag with part of the word “liberate” visible.
“I will make all of Hong Kong pay attention, and let them know what it means by ‘hard times create strong men’,” Yiu said to his friends before riding off."

Wharf Real Estate Investment Co, one of Hong Kong’s biggest commercial landlords, said earnings tumbled last year as revenue from investment and hotel properties declined and a multi-year slump in the property market further eroded the value of its assets.
Net profit fell 81 per cent from a year earlier to HK$891 million (US$114.7 million), mainly due to a five-fold increase in property revaluation deficit to HK$5.66 billion amid weak demand for commercial real estate, it said in a stock exchange filing on Monday. Revenue slipped 3 per cent to HK$12.9 billion. Excluding the deficit, earnings from its underlying business rose by 2 per cent.
Wharf Reic, as the group is known, is controlled by the family of billionaire Peter Woo. The Harbour City mall in Tsim Sha Tsui and the Times Square shopping centre in Causeway Bay are among its key assets. It operates The Murray and Marco Polo hotels.
“While Hong Kong’s economy showed signs of moderate growth, demand for commercial properties remained weak,” it said. “The strong local currency and rather gradual pace of interest rate cuts continued to dampen retail sales. Office demand was also soft as businesses sought to control costs in an uncertain environment.”

More than two years after China’s stringent Covid-19 lockdowns triggered an exodus of international businesses and expatriates, the country’s high-end property market continues to suffer from falling rents, with analysts warning the downturn could persist for some time amid declining home prices.
The average rent for flats in Beijing’s central business district, home to more than 118 multinational companies, declined as much as 17 per cent year on year in February to 11,385 yuan (US$1,750) per square metre, according to data compiled by Beike, a real estate services provider owned by KE Holdings.
Rents in neighbouring Dawanglu, as well as those in Jianguomen Wai, an upscale neighbourhood near the diplomatic enclave, both fell 6 per cent. The average rent in the city has dropped by 11 per cent since before the pandemic.
Shanghai fared no better. In Pudong’s Lujiazui, a financial hub known for its luxury high-rises, rents fell 8 per cent, while those near the landmark Jingan Temple tumbled 13 per cent last month. The average rent in the city has fallen 13 per cent compared with pre-pandemic levels.
“The decline in these areas isn’t recent,” said Lu Wenxi, an analyst at Centaline Property, noting that this has been the case since people left in droves following the pandemic lockdown."

Consolidating second place in the jockeys’ premiership, Bowman converted a strong book on paper to a three-timer when he booted home Harmony Galaxy, Stellar Swift and Casa Rochester.
The Australian ace was at his brilliant best on Mark Newnham’s Casa Rochester, weaving his way through the field from near the tail to lift the import to a narrow triumph in the Class Four Oi Man Handicap (1,650m).
“I had nice rides coming into the meeting and you don’t expect them all to win, but [Casa Rochester] had an awkward barrier [eight] but he was aided by a frantic speed and I did think he would be a better horse ridden to hit the line and it proved right,” Bowman said.

“I think he’s still pretty immature and lacks strength. He might have more in store.”
A maiden winner on his only New Zealand start when known as Rochester pre-import, Casa Rochester had raced without luck on his five Hong Kong starts before the breakthrough success.
Another import, Harmony Galaxy, started Bowman’s big night with his own breakthrough win in the city at start 14 for Danny Shum Chap-shing in the Class Four Wylie Handicap (1,800m).
“Harmony Galaxy has been a work in progress, he needs to relax to produce his best and I was a bit worried going past the post for the first time that he wasn’t settling for me but then the pace increased and he got into a really beautiful rhythm,” Bowman said after Brazilian Group One placegetter Harmony Galaxy flew home to beat Can’t Go Wong by a short head.
“I thought he got to the front with a bit in hand and he floated a bit and waited so, again, he’s still got more up his sleeve but it was great to win for him and the connections.”
Stellar Swift was the middle leg of Bowman’s treble, capitalising on an inside run in the straight to claim the second section of the Class Four King’s Park Handicap (1,200m) for trainer David Hayes.
The win of the night belonged to Colourful King, who demolished his opposition with an electrifying display in the Class Three Hong Kong China Rugby Cup (1,000m).
After a narrow triumph over Youthful Spirits second up, the David Eustace-trained three-year-old again proved too slick for that galloper but improved his winning margin to a dominant two lengths under Andrea Atzeni.
“He was impressive today,” said Eustace, who continued his winning spree after a Sha Tin treble last Sunday.
“The race looked like it would set up well for him. They were clearly going to go pretty quick up front, which certainly helped, but having said that he won with authority.
“We were confident he would improve – it was only his third start and he trained on really nicely, so we came here hopeful.”
Sent off the $3 favourite, Colourful King settled midfield on the fence and sprinted powerfully once Atzeni came off the rail in the straight.

He roared past pacesetter Youthful Spirits 75m out, relegating Mark Newnham’s speedster to a fourth runner-up result this term. Another ex-Australian galloper, Casa Of Honor, was a distant third on his Hong Kong debut for Michael Chang Chun-wai.
Eustace forecast a bright future for Colourful King, a two-time Sandown winner in Australia when known as Blue Renegade.
“He’ll keep getting better and better,” said Eustace, who is in the midst of a successful first campaign in Hong Kong with 24 winners.
“I’m mindful of that and I don’t want to over-race him this year. As I’ve said before, I think he will get 1,200m but I wouldn’t necessarily want to rush him there either.”"

While the US business community is wringing its hands with a growing sense of trepidation over the impact of swelling tariffs, a tech-solution service provider based in the US state of Tennessee is among those remaining optimistic about doing business in China.
Ali Din, CEO of the Premier NX, which offers services to US and Canadian clients from the transport and financial service industries in China, said that some American firms may want to maintain or even expand their businesses in China amid skyrocketing tariffs, but a new operating model is needed.
“Things may be a bit fluid, policy-wise, and so a company should really look at how do I de-risk, how do I rebalance my operation, and [how do I] do so in a way that I’m not relying on legislative changes,” he explained.
With tariffs on China surpassing 100 per cent, Din noted that some American businesses have kick-started evaluations with their Chinese partners to determine how much cost they can pass on to customers and how much cost the companies and suppliers can absorb.
“For companies that are in China, I don’t think they want to leave,” Din said. “They’re looking to the government to provide some assurance around consistency of policy and continue to have good working terms for businesses. The key [is] really to weather through and navigate this [with] flexibility.”
American firms can employ an “indirect route” or “hybrid strategy” to get around geopolitical issues and operate in China, Din suggested."

Further counter-tariffs are due to be imposed in mid-May and at the end of the year, affecting products including beef, poultry and citrus fruits such as oranges or grapefruit. Additional tariffs on nuts and soybeans are planned for early December.
The tariffs approved on Wednesday are in response to the US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports imposed about a month ago.

Cunanan claimed that Roque boasted of his ability to “bring down a government” during discussions about disseminating a doctored video intended to damage the president’s credibility.
Roque, identified by Cunanan in an affidavit submitted to the “Tri-Com” inquiry – a joint investigation by three congressional committees – denied the accusations to This Week in Asia on Wednesday.
Cunanan said the video – a manipulated clip supposedly showing Marcos Jnr sniffing cocaine – was first discussed during a July 2024 dinner in Hong Kong.
The event at Yung Kee Restaurant in the city’s Central district was attended by 16 supporters of Duterte, including Roque, former executive secretary Vic Rodriguez, and ex-press secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles. The gathering occurred after a “Maisug” prayer rally – a movement loosely affiliated with pro-Duterte causes."

TikTok Shop, a major e-commerce platform connecting Chinese vendors with overseas consumers, has flagged US tariff risks to its merchants, as well as promoting European sites, after US President Donald Trump tripled tariffs on small parcels exported from mainland China and Hong Kong, which were previously exempt from duties.
The exemption had greatly benefited Chinese online sellers by waiving duties on items valued at under US$800, underpinning the boom in cross-border e-commerce via platforms such as TikTok Shop, Shein, Temu as well as Amazon.com.
But according to an amendment on so-called reciprocal tariffs imposed by the White House, the new rate on packages priced up to US$800 will be 90 per cent of their value, up from the original levy of 30 per cent.

While US President Donald Trump’s tariff hikes stoke fears of inflation in America, China is likely to face the opposite problem: deepening deflation that compounds a long-running economic headache for Beijing.
But China’s push to boost domestic demand amid an escalating global trade war could help cushion the downward pressure on prices, analysts said.
Now, Washington’s tariff hikes threaten to exacerbate those issues, with another 50 per cent increase in US duties on Chinese goods taking effect at noon on Wednesday.
“China’s problem is … more related to demand, as it has overcapacity,” said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis Corporate and Investment Bank. “Losing overseas markets can pressure China’s corporate profit margins and fuel competition domestically.”"

The deal caps weeks of haggling between chancellor-in-waiting Merz and the SPD after he topped elections in February but fell well short of a majority, with the far-right Alternative for Germany surging into second place.
Pressure to reach a deal has taken on new urgency as the government will take charge at a time of global turbulence in an escalating trade conflict sparked by US President Donald Trump’s sweeping import tariffs.

Merz, who called Trump’s US an unreliable ally, has already vowed to build up defence spending as Europe faces a hostile Russia, and to support businesses struggling with high costs and weak demand.
He has also pledged to get tougher on migration, moving Germany away from a more liberal immigration policy under his conservative predecessor Angela Merkel during the 2015 European migrant crisis."

Instead of each service conducting their own manoeuvres to prepare for the same kind of scenario, the joint rehearsals aim to get a much clearer idea of the requirements for complex combat engagement, vice-admiral Michael Boyle, the director of navy staff, told a conference in Maryland this week.
The People’s Liberation Army has also been looking to improve the coordination between different services and in domains such as space, cyber, and electronic warfare.
Boyle, who did not directly name China according to the report, said the different services were looking for “a lot more fidelity, a lot more joint flavour” in training exercises.
He said specialists from the Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force, and Cyber Command were all taking part in the drills, running tactical-level rehearsals to figure out “how do I sense and make sense”."

China has unveiled a comprehensive framework reaffirming its stance on trade ties with the United States, warning that its tariffs would “ultimately backfire”, while still leaving the door open for “equal-footed dialogue” between the countries.
The white paper, released by the State Council Information Office on Wednesday against the backdrop of an escalated trade war, outlines China’s position on key issues – highlighting the “mutually beneficial nature” of China-US trade; voicing support for free trade; warning against the harms of unilateralism and protectionism; and urging dialogue to resolve disputes.
“History and reality have shown that raising tariffs will not solve the US’ own problems,” China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a response released along with the white paper on Wednesday, urging Washington to immediately lift “unilateral measures” and enhance dialogue.
“Instead, it triggers market volatility, fuels inflation in the US, erodes its industrial base, and increases the risk of its economic recession – ultimately, the US will only suffer the consequences itself.”
The document was released before China announced the imposition of a fresh 50 per cent tariff on all American imports in response to a 50 per cent tariff hike on its goods from US President Donald Trump.
This is the third time since the trade war erupted in 2018 that China has issued a white paper, according to Xu Weijun, a researcher with the South China University of Technology’s Institute of Public Policy in Guangzhou, adding that “the intended audience is not just the US”."

Beijing has urged several US lawmakers to “pull back from the brink” after they reintroduced a bill to give the White House the power to close Hong Kong’s three trade offices in the country, vowing retaliation if the proposal progresses any further.
The Commissioner’s Office of China’s Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong issued the warning on Wednesday after US congressmen Chris Smith and James McGovern revived the bipartisan Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office Certification Act.
The proposed legislation would empower the White House to strip Hong Kong’s trade offices in New York, San Francisco and Washington of their privileges or close them if they were deemed to operate without a “high degree of autonomy” from the People’s Republic of China.
A spokesman for the commissioner’s office said the three trade offices had played a positive role in promoting Hong Kong-US economic and commercial ties, adding that their operations should not be placed under unreasonable scrutiny.
“Some US politicians, driven by their own political self-interest, openly smeared and defamed the Hong Kong trade offices. [They are] not only interfering with and disrupting normal Hong Kong-US exchanges and cooperation but also exposing their vicious intention to disrupt Hong Kong’s stability and prosperity,” he said."

China will impose additional 50 per cent tariffs on all American imports in response to a similar level of tariff increases on its goods from US President Donald Trump, marking what threatens to be an end to normalised trade relations between the world’s two biggest economies.
At the same time, the world’s second-largest economy pledged to release new supportive policies in a timely manner amid external shocks.
Beijing’s move marked a clear signal that it would resolutely defend its interests and fight to the end, analysts warned as the tit-for-tat retaliation and the high tariffs risk a further decoupling with the US.
Trump’s action, which brought the cumulative total of additional import duties to 104 per cent since he took office in January, took effect at noon on Wednesday and took the total impact to around 115 per cent on Chinese goods.
Beijing’s levy is due to take effect at noon on Thursday, and it would bring accumulative additional tariffs raised by Beijing to 84 per cent.

Simon Willis tore into Hong Kong’s cricketers for delivering “one of the worst bowling performances” of his two-year tenure in a four-wicket loss to Kuwait on Wednesday.
The Englishman said he was “frustrated at players and the team making the same mistakes and not learning quickly enough”.
Willis also questioned whether it was “maybe time to change some things”.
“We have shown faith in players for a long period of time … and they don’t win enough matches for Hong Kong,” he added.
The first chance for new faces could come as early as Thursday, when Hong Kong play Qatar – who lost to Nepal by eight wickets on Wednesday – in their second match of the quadrangular T20 series.
Against Kuwait, opener Anshy Rath’s 76 formed the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s 175 for five, a total Willis said was “10 runs light, but enough to be in the game” at Tin Kwong Road Recreation Ground.
In response, Kuwait opener Ravija Sandaruwan hit 49 from 36 balls, and when he was run out with the score 72-3, Meet Bhavsar (42) and captain Mohammed Aslam (55) put on a match-winning fourth-wicket stand of 84 in eight overs."

A US congressional commission has urged lawmakers to take action to counter China’s “frightening” ascent in biotechnology, flagging Chinese firms including WuXi AppTec and BioMap, as the tech rivalry between the two major powers continues to escalate.
China was “quickly ascending to biotechnology dominance” and the US must “take swift action in the next three years” to maintain its competitiveness, the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology (NSCEB) said in a report published on Wednesday. It described the conclusion as “sobering, even frightening”, following two years of research.
China has recently achieved success across “core biotechnology capabilities”, including drug discovery driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and what it calls “biomanufacturing”, according to the NSCEB.
The three-year-old commission cited Chinese start-up BioMap as an example of the country’s efforts in AI-enabled biotech, noting its 100+ billion-parameter foundational model and an investment from the Hong Kong government.
“China’s leading biomanufacturers” such as WuXi AppTec then scaled up biological products with its global network of facilities, allowing the Chinese government to “control a global supply chain”, the commission said, adding that WuXi AppTec was the “Huawei equivalent for biotechnology”.
With such advances, China may soon “eclipse” the US, which “may never be able to catch up”, the commission claimed."

Hong Kong health authorities have issued offers to 12 non-locally trained dentists, including three who started working in the city last month, with all of them fluent in Cantonese and English, amid the city’s efforts to ease a labour shortage.
The Department of Health on Wednesday said the rest of the group was expected to have their limited registration approved by the Dental Council in the coming two months, adding that the candidates had met the requirements to be hired locally as dentists, such as being able to speak both languages fluently.
Dr Kitty Hse Mei-yin, consultant in-charge for the department’s dental services, said authorities had embarked on a two-month global recruitment push last July.
“At the end of September, we received a very enthusiastic response, with more than 90 applications,” she said.
“Through a rigorous selection process, we chose 12 dentists who are non-locally trained. We have issued them offers to join the Department of Health.”
The recruitment drive followed the Legislative Council’s approval of amendments to the Dentist Registration Ordinance, allowing non-locally trained dentists to work in the city without having to pass the city’s licensing exams."

Additionally, the court pointed out that he had stabbed the victim in the neck – a serious injury that contradicted his claim that he did not plan to take his friend’s life.

Economic ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) are due to meet in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday to discuss a unified response to the tariffs.

FRYb, a small restaurant just south of Quy Nhon-gil in Seoul’s Itaewon district, describes itself as an “American Fried Bistro”.
However, members of the local Filipino community have noticed something else about it.
Perhaps it is the lower case “b” in “FRYb”, which officially stands for “bistro” but somewhat evokes the name of the Filipino fast-food chain Jollibee.
Not many would dispute fried chicken’s American origin, but a few distinct features in FRYb’s menu reveal that this is American food brought to you via the Philippines."

Leicester City, AZ Alkmaar and hosts Football Club will await Hong Kong U22 in a men’s tournament featuring 16 teams, from eight countries or regions, divided into four groups of four.
“It’s great for local players to play against players who might be future Premier League stars,” John Morling, the local association’s technical director, said on Wednesday. “They might discover they’re not miles away from that level, and realise that if they do more technically, tactically and physically, they could become professionals.”
The Sevens, which will be staged over three days from May 16, also includes a six-team women’s tournament, and eight teams of over-35s vying for the masters prize.
Morling said his uplifting experiences from competing twice in the Sevens, in his former role as Brighton & Hove Albion academy head, had an impact on his decision to come to Hong Kong.
He said that for Brighton, and fellow Premier League entrants Leicester, West Ham United and Aston Villa, the Sevens provided a “completely different technical and tactical challenge”."

The images show the airfield’s distinctive grid layout – said to have been based on the streets of Manhattan by the wartime personnel who built it – gradually emerging from the tropical jungle.

Peter Miller, known as the “Condition Nutrition”, has quickly become one of the most sought-after names in combat sports nutrition.
Based in Bangkok, though originally from Liverpool, UK, he has helped some of ONE Championship’s biggest names make weight safely – without compromising performance.
Weight cutting is a normal part of combat sports, but in ONE Championship there is a twist: fighters must also pass a hydration test.
“In ONE Championship, you have to make weight and also pass a hydration test,” Miller said. “It’s a double challenge: you’ve got to make sure you’ve got enough fluids in your body to pee a hydrated sample, and then also you’ve got to make the weight.”
But it is in this added complexity that Miller has thrived. His guidance has helped turn around the fortunes of some of the best fighters, including Rodtang Jitmuangnon.
“At first, it was a challenge,” Miller said. “I think Rodtang had this reputation of potentially being difficult to work with."

Increasingly frail but with undimmed passion, Britain’s David Hockney has put aside his health worries to shape in Paris what he describes as the biggest exhibition of his vast career.
With around 400 works over four floors, drawn from museums and private collections worldwide, the exhibition at the Louis Vuitton Foundation is a stunning tribute to one of the world’s bestselling living artists.
Although titled “David Hockney 25” and mostly focused on the last quarter-century of his life, it also contains paintings from his early career, as well as his blockbuster time in California in the 1960s.
In the last of 11 rooms there are several unseen creations from the past two years, including a self-portrait in acrylic and a striking meditation on the afterlife inspired by Dante’s Divine Comedy.
“[The show] has enabled him to look back in a positive way,” said Norman Rosenthal, guest curator and a long-time friend of Hockney, ahead of its opening to the public on April 9. “He’s very, very happy with the exhibition.”"

In Japan, a nation famed for its high standards of customer service, a new survey has found that nearly half of those polled think asking store employees to smile is a form of harassment.
Kyoto-based customer support platform Helpfeel conducted the survey of 1,070 people nationwide in March, The Mainichi reported on Monday.
It found that 45.7 per cent of respondents viewed requests for store staff to smile as harassment, with no significant difference in views across age groups.
The results suggest a growing sensitivity to the pressures placed on service workers, signalling a shift away from traditional expectations of unwavering cheerfulness in customer interactions.
“Many people probably think that store employees feel resistant to being required to maintain customer service demeanour above a certain level,” a Helpfeel representative told The Mainichi.
Omotenashi, the Japanese concept of hospitality, emphasises anticipating and fulfilling customer needs with utmost care and respect. When entering a store or restaurant in Japan, it is common to be greeted with a smile, a bow and an enthusiastic “irasshaimase!”, meaning “welcome” in Japanese."

Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Erick Tsang Kwok-wai defended the increased costs on Wednesday, saying election promotional efforts were “of key importance”, even as he stressed that no turnout target had been set as it depended on “many different factors”.
Tsang and lawmakers discussed the government’s plan to spend HK$1.28 billion (US$165 million) on the December 7 election, set to be the second under a “patriots-only” electoral overhaul.
The planned budget represents a 52 per cent surge from the HK$841 million spent on the 2021 election, which had a turnout of only 30.2 per cent – the lowest since the city’s return to Chinese rule in 1997.
In a paper submitted to the Legco finance committee on Monday, the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau said the increase would be mainly spent on election promotion and technological appliances.
Authorities would allocate HK$177 million for election promotion, HK$814 million for technological appliances and voting venues’ rents, and HK$289 million to pay the possible 37,000 personnel, according to the paper."

Hong Kong’s first electric ferry is expected to run three days a week between North Point and Hung Hom or Kowloon City and can offer 52 single trips daily without recharging at full operation, environmental authorities have said.
Principal environmental protection officer Benny So King-lung said on Wednesday that the HK$65 million (US$8.4 million) vessel, named Xin Ming Zhu XXXIX and operated by Sun Ferry Services Company, had carried passengers in trial runs.
He added that services would be increased gradually following the successful completion of the test runs on Monday and March 31, which involved four single trips each day.
“Passengers gave positive feedback … The journey is quiet and has no diesel smell,” So said.
“The ferry is made of carbon fibre, which is lighter than a steel ferry by 70 per cent. The lighter weight can save the power needed and is more environmentally friendly.”
He added that the electric vessel would carry passengers during non-rush hours and soon step up its service to three days a week. So did not indicate when it would go into full operation."

Amid escalating trade tensions between China and the United States, some Chinese exporters are taking the drastic step of ditching shipments mid-voyage and surrendering containers to shipping companies to avoid crushing tariff costs.
Industry insiders have dubbed the move “preparing for the Long March”, a grim metaphor for what many see as a prolonged and punishing downturn in cross-Pacific trade.
“We’ve halted all shipping plans from the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia,” the employee said. “Every factory order is halted. Anything that hasn’t been loaded will be scrapped, and the cargo already at sea is being re-costed.”
One client had told the company it was abandoning goods already on the water and giving them to the shipping company, as “no one will buy them after the tariffs are imposed”.
The company’s leadership had returned to China to manage a flood of order cancellations and had instructed its staff to suspend all container business until tariffs stabilise or alternative markets are secured."

Investors are taking cover in Chinese military stocks amid heightened tension between Beijing and Washington in the wake of the tit-for-tat trade war, as gains spurred by the DeepSeek trade have almost fizzled out.
Defence-equipment companies trading in Hong Kong and on the mainland are the latest hedge against the turbulence triggered by US President Donald Trump’s so-called reciprocal tariffs. Among them, CSSC Offshore & Marine Engineering surged 16 per cent to HK$9.56 in Hong Kong on Wednesday, extending an 8.3 per cent surge a day earlier, while AviChina Industry & Technology gained 8 per cent to HK$3.37. In Shenzhen, China Harzone Industry jumped 20 per cent to 8.28 yuan and Xian Triangle Defense advanced 11 per cent to 23.90 yuan.
The resilience is in contrast to broader market volatility as the world’s two largest economies show no signs of backing down from the latest tariff showdown. The Hang Seng Index briefly entered a bear market on Wednesday after a 20 per cent decline from a March high, reversing the gains in Chinese tech stocks sparked by the emergence of DeepSeek.
“The military industry is providing stability against the backdrop of turbulence in global markets,” said Shi Kang, an analyst at Industrial Securities. “As global trade and the geopolitical landscape worsen, demand for weapons procurement will rise significantly.”

Even the most sumptuous cushions cannot ease the pain that Italian luxury furniture makers – gathered at their annual fair – can already feel from US President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
Some companies at the Milan Furniture Fair, which opened on Tuesday, compare the sudden levies to a rampaging wrecking crew. But many are also determined to keep offering their prestige output in the hope that buyers in the key US market will stick with them.
The United States is the Italian furniture industry’s second-biggest market after France, accounting for 2.2 billion euros (US$2.4 billion) of its 19.4 billion euros of exports in 2024, according to industry figures.
The “geopolitical” factors, such as the new tariffs, “will certainly have long-term repercussions,” the fair’s president Maria Porro said.
About 10 per cent of all Italy’s exports go to the US, and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will go to Washington on April 17 in a bid to ease the impact of the 20 per cent tariffs imposed on European Union products.
Some furniture firms said it is too early to know how much damage can be expected from the tariffs that have shaken global markets."

The Hong Kong Museum of Art (HKMOA) has confirmed it has taken over preparations for the city’s exhibition at the 2026 Venice Biennale.
Rather than focus the exhibition on the work of a single artist, which has been the case since 2009, the next Hong Kong exhibition in Venice will feature the work of several artists selected from a long list containing over 200 names.
The decision to replace M+ with the HKMOA was made by the council, whose members are appointed by the government and is the official presenter of the biennial exhibitions in Venice; it rents the building used to house the city’s contribution. The change, while not officially confirmed until now, has been widely discussed in the city’s art community since invitations for nominations were sent out in January."

Japanese badminton star Chiharu Shida has pleaded with fans in China to stop stalking her, saying that she feels “very uncomfortable and very scared”.
Shida, who is playing in the Badminton Asia Championships in Ningbo, on Tuesday said on social media that every time she had competed in China in the past 18 months, she had encountered stalkers.
The 27-year-old, who won a bronze medal in the women’s doubles at the Paris Olympics last year, is hugely popular in China and is often referred to as “the most beautiful badminton player” on social media.
“Thank you to everyone for your continued support, but I would like to request something from all my fans,” Shida wrote.
“We have been stalked every time we compete in China, it has already been going on for a year and a half. Recently, we’ve been feeling very uncomfortable and very scared.”
Shida, writing in simplified Chinese characters, did not elaborate further or explain her use of “we”. Her doubles partner is Nami Matsuyama."

The price of gold has tumbled amid shock waves from the tariff war between the United States and China, but the precious metal remains the safe-haven asset of choice in times of volatility, analysts said.
Analysts attributed the drop to short-term sell-offs by traders needing to cover losses from other asset classes.
Alex Chiu, senior exchange-traded fund (ETF) strategist at asset management firm Value Partners, said gold could be used to mitigate losses when the wider market was experiencing “abnormal volatility”.
“During market downturns … brokers may initiate a margin call that sells off gold to cover losses in other positions,” he said, adding that gold was an easily liquidated asset.

But Chinese biotech start-ups are aiming to change that – by designing cancer therapy for a fraction of the cost and also taking on Western pharmaceutical giants in the process.

[The content of this article has been produced by our advertising partner.]
With its sights set on long-term competitiveness, Hong Kong is embracing innovation as a core pillar of economic transformation, driven in part by strategic government support and an expanding ecosystem of tech-focused enterprises.
This April, the city will once again play host to two major technology and trade events: the third edition of InnoEX and the 21st HKTDC Hong Kong Electronics Fair (Spring Edition).
While the city has long positioned itself as an international financial centre, these annual fairs reflect a continued push to build its credentials as a regional tech hub, and as an emerging platform for broader exchange between public institutions, global buyers and the start-up community.
Both fairs are flagship events of the Business of Innovation and Technology Week (BIT Week), scheduled to run from April 13 to 16 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre.
Co-organised by the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau (ITIB) and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), the two fairs are expected to attract over 2,800 exhibitors from 29 countries and regions this year, offering an expansive view of how innovation is being applied across sectors, from smart mobility to healthcare, and from robotics to consumer electronics."

Hong Kong will implement part of its revised HK$2 (26 US cents) transport fare scheme in April next year, five months ahead of schedule, the city’s welfare minister has said, with the move expected to save authorities HK$260 million.
Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun Yuk-han said on Wednesday that elderly and disabled passengers who used the public transport subsidy scheme would need to pay 20 per cent of fares that exceeded HK$10 from next April.
The early implementation of the policy would save the government HK$260 million, he said. But Sun added that a cap on the number of trips under the scheme at 240 a month would be implemented from around April 2027.
“After close consultation with Octopus and public transport operators, we can now confirm that the requirement of paying 20 per cent of a fare surpassing HK$10 can be implemented ahead of schedule, in April 2026, five months earlier than originally scheduled,” he told a special meeting of the Legislative Council’s Finance Committee.
“If we look at it from the perspective of fiscal savings, an additional HK$260 million can be saved.”"

A Hong Kong court has jailed a social worker for three years and nine months for rioting in a 2019 anti-government protest, following a retrial, with the judge shaving off 10 months because of the lengthy legal proceedings.
Deputy District Judge May Chung Ming-sun said on Wednesday that Jackie Chen Hung-sau, 48, was present with multiple microphones and a loudspeaker on Hennessy Road and Luard Road in Wan Chai on the night of August 31, 2019, showing her intent to participate in the riot.
She was among the estimated 500 people gathered in the area, with some throwing petrol bombs and glass bottles at police officers, as well as shouting slogans and blocking roads.
In September 2020, the veteran social worker was acquitted midway through the original trial after a judge found she had no case to answer. Three other defendants in the same case were also found not guilty.
But the Department of Justice appealed against their acquittals the following year and won the appeal in 2023, resulting in the four being brought back to court for a retrial last year.
Chen pleaded not guilty during the retrial last year, while the other three – tutor Lai Pui-ki, programmer Chung Ka-nang and chef Jason Gung Tsz Shun – admitted to a count of rioting."

A new survey has found that four in 10 Singaporean voters would vote for the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) if the election were held tomorrow, while most have not decided who to vote for.
The poll of 1,845 citizens aged 21 and above, conducted between March 25 and April 1 by market research company YouGov, found that 44 per cent of respondents have decided which party they will vote for.
Nineteen per cent said they were undecided, 13 per cent were “leaning towards a particular party but remain open to change”, 11 per cent said they would make their decision during the campaign period, and 3 per cent said they would decide at the voting booth.
Proceedings are already under way with new electoral boundaries announced last month and parties ramping up their presence on the ground and introducing prospective new candidates to residents.
According to the survey, a greater proportion of Gen Z voters born between 1997 and 2012 said they had not made up their minds about which party they would vote for, with 30 per cent decided. Baby boomers born between 1946 and 1964 showed the most certainty among the age groups with just over half saying they had made their decision."

Researchers from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau attempting to log in to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, managed by the US National Cancer Institute, have been denied access since Friday.
They have instead been greeted with a terse notification that “access cannot be restored at this time”.
SEER covers 48 per cent of the US population and provides nationwide data on cancer incidence, survival rates and treatments to support research and epidemiological investigations. It was previously open to researchers across the globe.
However, access has been completely blocked to institutions in designated countries – which include Russia, Iran and North Korea as well as China – under a security update published last week by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US.
A researcher at Shanghai’s prestigious Fudan University, who asked not to be identified, said the ban was “a very serious scientific event”.
“Many graduate students’ research topics rely on this data for preliminary exploration, and many projects require international data for validation. Therefore, the crucial piece of cancer data is missing, greatly diminishing its practicality.”"

Starting in the 1980s, New York law enforcement and health officials fielded sexual abuse complaints from the young patients of a respected paediatrician who ran his practice out of a basement office in his home on Long Island.
But Stuart Copperman was never charged with any crime, and it was only as he approached retirement in 2000, at the age of 65, that he was stripped of his medical licence over the complaints.
Now, 25 years later, more than 100 of his former patients have some vindication in their years-long fight: a court has ordered him to pay a total of US$1.6 billion.
The Reverend Debbi Rhodes, who was awarded US$25 million, said the completion of the litigation in late March in state Supreme Court brought a mix of relief and frustration.
“I’m not sure if he’s facing justice. He kind of got away with it for all these years,” the 63-year-old Episcopal priest in Las Vegas said by phone. “But to have a court say, definitively, ‘I believe you.’ To hear that – that’s heavy medicine right there.”
A Manhattan lawyer who has represented Copperman over the years did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment in recent days."

Rides and shows could be based around film characters including Shrek, the Minions, Jurassic Park dinosaurs and Harry Potter."

Their courage in the face of danger has drawn viral admiration – and calls for greater recognition of the city state’s migrant workforce.
Spotting smoke billowing from the building in the River Valley area on Tuesday morning, the construction workers moved swiftly, grabbing scaffolding and a ladder.
Without the use of safety harnesses, they scaled the building to rescue children trapped by the flames on a third-storey ledge.
“I took the step ladder and put it here, and … went to the roof” said Shakil Mohammad, one of the workers, in an interview with CNA. “I caught the baby and passed to my friend. One by one, I brought them down.”
Ramesh Kumar, another worker involved in the daring rescue, said: “It’s not just us two, another person also helped, but I don’t know who. At that time, many came to help, but we don’t know who.”"

Prabowo said he had instructed his foreign minister to quickly discuss with the Palestinian side and other parties about how to evacuate affected Palestinians to Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation.
“We are ready to evacuate the wounded, the traumatised, the orphans,” Prabowo said, adding that the victims would be in Indonesia temporarily until they had fully recovered from their injuries and the situation in Gaza was safe for their return.
Israel’s war in Gaza was triggered in October 2023, when Hamas fighters killed 1,200 people in southern Israel, and took some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.
Since then, more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s military campaign, Palestinian authorities have said.
Indonesia wants to increase its role in seeking a resolution to the conflict, Prabowo said, adding that this plan was not easy.
“Indonesia’s commitment in supporting the safety of Palestinians and their independence has pushed our government to act more actively,” Prabowo said, as he was about to embark on an overseas trip which includes Turkey, Egypt and Qatar."

Progress has been made on efforts to secure a defence and security pact between Britain and the EU in time for the meeting in London next month, according to people familiar with the matter from both sides of the negotiations. They requested anonymity discussing a deal that has not been finalised.
Officials are also continuing discussions on an agreement on fishing rights, the people said. If a deal cannot be reached in time for the May 19 summit then a commitment towards one, potentially including a framework and timeline for future negotiations, could be made, the people said.
Developments in the negotiations reflect how Trump’s tariff war and policy on Ukraine and European defence more widely have pushed the UK and EU closer together. Where previously disagreement over fishing had been seen as a stumbling block on the way to a broader agreement, there is now a desire on both sides to find an elegant solution to that ensures the defence and security deal is not delayed, the people said.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told a parliamentary committee on Tuesday that he thought “real progress” could be made on UK-EU relations and indicated that London should be able to access an EU defence fund once it agrees a security pact. “It is very important that our defence companies are involved,” he said, adding that fisheries were an important part of discussions.
A UK government spokesperson said the government “will not be providing a running commentary on talks when it comes to our dialogue with the EU”."

US President Donald Trump has tripled the tariff on small parcels sent to the United States from mainland China and Hong Kong that are currently exempt from duties, amid an escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies.
According to an amendment on so-called reciprocal tariffs published by the White House on Wednesday Hong Kong time, the new rate on shipments priced up to US$800 will be 90 per cent of their value, up from the originally planned levy of 30 per cent.
The per postal item fee will be raised to US$75 from the original US$25 after May 2 and US$150 from the planned US$50 after June 1.
While the tax exemption on items of marginal value under a rule dating back to the 1930s was due to end on May 2, the latest increase comes after Beijing retaliated against Trump’s previous round of tariffs.
Washington earlier accused Chinese online marketplaces such as Temu and Shein of taking advantage of the “de minimis” loophole to send goods to the US duty-free.
In the latest development, Trump also announced he would apply an additional 50 per cent tariff on Chinese imports, pushing the total levy on many goods from the country to 104 per cent. The new US tariff took effect at noon on Wednesday Hong Kong time."

Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has described his club’s post-season trip to Hong Kong as a “small sacrifice” to reward fans in the region and bring in revenue.
The match will take place just two days after United play a friendly fixture against Asean All Stars in Malaysia, and only five days after their final match of the English Premier League campaign, against Aston Villa.
But Amorim defended the club’s decision to fly his players to the Far East before the June international window, for matches in front of a possible 84,000 fans in Kuala Lumpur and up to 40,000 in Hong Kong.
“We have to look at the context of the club,” Amorim told Sky Sports. “We are raising our tickets [prices] for our fans.
“We are doing all this, so we have also to make sacrifices – and [it] is a small sacrifice. It will be six days and we make contact with our fans around the world."

“This is the first time a real quantum computer has been used to fine-tune a large language model in a practical setting. It shows that current quantum hardware can begin to support real-world AI training tasks,” said Chen Zhaoyun, a researcher at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence under the Hefei Comprehensive National Science Centre.

Does the arrival of China’s low-cost DeepSeek mean the end of Nvidia’s chip dominance?
The improved AI model also reportedly delivered better results on specific tasks. When trained on mental health conversation data, it made 15 per cent fewer mistakes and in a maths problem-solving test, its accuracy rose from 68 to 82 per cent, according to Science and Technology Daily.
Fine-tuning is a key step in customising general AI models such as DeepSeek or Qwen for specialised tasks, such as analysing medical data. Traditionally, this process relies on powerful servers and faces multiple challenges, including limited ability to scale and high energy consumption.
Quantum computing, by contrast, brings unique advantages. By leveraging quantum principles such as superposition – one particle holding multiple possible states at once – and entanglement, which means particles remain linked and instantly affect each other, quantum computers can explore vast combinations of parameters simultaneously, making AI training much faster and more efficient."

Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is seeking to raise about US$20 billion in what will be the largest fund in its history, to capitalise on global investors’ interest in backing US artificial intelligence companies, sources told Reuters.
The tech investment firm, known informally as a16z, has told limited partners that the fund will be dedicated to growth-stage investments in AI companies and draw upon global investors keen on investing in American companies, the sources said. The record fundraising and the goal of capitalising on foreign investment interest in the US tech industry come against the backdrop of a sweeping tariff plan by President Donald Trump to urge companies to manufacture goods in the US
To raise such a large amount of capital, a16z has been pitching it around the world. International LPs see the fund as a way to invest their money more easily into American AI companies without restrictions, one of the sources said.
Andreessen Horowitz did not reply to requests for comment.
A16z’s founders, venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, announced last year they would support Trump, breaking with their traditional support for Democratic candidates, a sentiment shared by other prominent Silicon Valley figures such as Elon Musk. Even by the standards of a firm known for raising some of Silicon Valley’s largest investment vehicles, the new fund would represent a colossal step up in scale."

That will include expanding the trade dispute to include the services sector, where China runs a substantial deficit with the US, according to Ren Yi, a blogger better known by his online alias Chairman Rabbit, citing unnamed sources with inside knowledge of official discussions in Beijing.
“The trade war has been focused solely on the goods trade, which is unreasonable because, in essence, the US buys our goods and sells us services,” Ren told the Post.
Ren, who has over 1 million followers on the Chinese microblogging platform Weibo, said in an article on Tuesday that Beijing still has six “remaining big moves” that it can use to counter US trade pressure.
Those measures include placing restrictions on purchases of services from US firms, “substantially” increasing tariffs on US soybeans, banning imports of US poultry and Hollywood films, suspending cooperation on controlling the illegal drug fentanyl, and investigating US companies in China over intellectual property-related issues.
Another political commentator with over 4 million followers on Weibo, known as Niutanqin, posted a list of the same six suggested countermeasures on the same day. The account is run by a senior journalist at Xinhua, the state-run Chinese news agency.

Policymakers also had numerous policy tools to mitigate the impact of sweeping US levies, he added.

Traders are pricing in a 25 basis point reduction in the bank’s policy rate within the next six months, according to swaps data, as sweeping US tariffs raise concerns over slower growth. Economists have lowered this year’s growth forecasts for Malaysia, which faces a 24 per cent levy. The top executive of Malaysia’s largest lender Maybank, Khairussaleh Ramli, said in a separate interview that there was room for a 25-basis-point cut.

The State Council, China’s cabinet, said on Wednesday that it will directly supervise the investigation and handling of the fire that killed at least 20 people in a nursing home blaze at Chengde, in the northern province of Hebei.
Chinese state media reported that the fire broke out at around 9pm on Tuesday at the home in a seniors’ residential complex in the city’s Longhua county. As of 3am on Wednesday, there were 20 confirmed fatalities, according to state news agency Xinhua.
The State Council ordered Hebei province to submit an investigation report for its review and approval. The report and follow-up punishment of those responsible, as well as any rectification measures, would be made public, it said.
Hebei police said earlier on Wednesday that the person in charge of the nursing home had been detained for investigation. Local and provincial authorities also sent dedicated teams to comfort the families of the dead and injured.
According to Jimu News, online portal for official newspaper Hubei Daily, the 300-bed Guoen Senior Home had 260 elderly residents at the time of the blaze, based on public records.
Among them were 98 people with total disabilities and 84 described as semi-disabled. The remaining 78 residents were capable of self-care, according to the records.
The facility, established in 2016, was recognised as a “grade one nursing home” by the Hebei’s provincial civil affairs department. According to the licensing record, its business scope was “providing accommodation, food, and day care for the elderly and disabled”."

As calls for Lebanon’s Hezbollah to disarm gain momentum, a senior Hezbollah official has said the group was ready to hold talks with the Lebanese president about its weapons if Israel withdraws from south Lebanon and stops its strikes.
US-backed President Joseph Aoun, who vowed when he took office in January to establish a state monopoly on the control of arms, intends to open talks with Hezbollah over its arsenal soon, three Lebanese political sources said.
Discussion of disarmament has intensified since the power balance was upended by last year’s war with Israel and the ousting of Hezbollah’s Syrian ally, ex-president Bashar al-Assad.
Hezbollah emerged severely weakened from the 2024 conflict with Israel when its top leaders and thousands of its fighters were killed and much of its rocket arsenal destroyed.
The senior Hezbollah official said the group was ready to discuss its arms in the context of a national defence strategy but this hinged on Israel pulling out its troops from five hilltops in south Lebanon.
“Hezbollah is ready to discuss the matter of its arms if Israel withdraws from the five points, and halts its aggression against Lebanese,” the senior official said."

Vietnam’s first post-war tourists from non-socialist and non-Communist countries were strictly chaperoned and could only stay in approved accommodation. After a number of reforms at the end of the 1980s and early 90s, tourists could choose where they went and where they stayed.

Huawei – a company at the centre of China’s AI chip ambitions that has been accused of sanctions busting and trade secret theft – is on a US trade list that restricts it from receiving goods made with US technology.
TSMC made nearly 3 million chips in recent years that matched the design ordered by Sophgo and likely ended up with Huawei, according to Lennart Heim, a researcher at RAND’s Technology and Security and Policy Centre in Arlington, Virginia, who is tracking Chinese developments in AI.
The US$1 billion-plus potential penalty came from export control regulations allowing for a fine of up to twice the value of transactions that violated the rules, the sources said. Because TSMC’s chipmaking equipment includes US technology, the company’s Taiwan factories are within reach of US export controls that prevent it from making chips for Huawei, or producing certain advanced chips for any customer in China without a US licence."

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the US will soon announce a “major” tariff on pharmaceutical imports.
Speaking to an event at the National Republican Congressional Committee, Trump said the tariff will incentivise drug companies to move their operations to the US.
“We are going to be announcing very shortly a major tariff on pharmaceuticals,” Trump said, without providing details on the planned levy.
“Once we do that, they’re going to come rushing back into our country, because we’re the big market,” Trump said. “The advantage we have over everybody is that we’re the big market.”
Trump has long bemoaned a lack of domestic pharmaceutical production and has repeatedly promised tariffs to bring more capacity into the country.
On Tuesday, European pharmaceutical companies warned the European Commission president that US tariffs would expedite the industry’s shift away from Europe and towards the United States."

Eight Hongkongers have been duped out of more than HK$2 million (US$257,380) after scammers convinced them to hand over cash to avoid fines for bogus money-laundering charges by posing as plain-clothes police officers outside government buildings.
Police said a man and a woman had been arrested, adding that one of them was accused of using fabricated Hong Kong police warrant cards and bogus letters from mainland Chinese authorities to trick victims into believing they had committed crimes across the border.
Acting Superintendent Sung Ching-wai of the regional anti-deception unit of New Territories South said: “To make the scenario more convincing, scammers instructed victims to bring tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands in cash to locations outside courts or government buildings, where the money was handed to accomplices impersonating police officers.”
The eight cases, in which scammers called victims and pretended to be mainland law enforcement officials, took place between March 24 and Monday. The victims, aged between 22 and 83, lost HK$2.2 million in total.
Sung said the male suspect, 23, was apprehended while taking cash from a victim. A fake warrant card and forged letters from mainland police were found on him.
Officers also confiscated HK$310,000 in cash that a victim was about to hand over to the man."

Even as Washington’s sweeping new tariff announcement appeared to come as a shotgun blast scattered across dozens of nations, Asian economies emerged as primary targets in US President Donald Trump’s crosshairs.
And with the region staring down the barrel of more devastating trade consequences as the new tariffs are due to take effect on Wednesday, a shadow has fallen over economic growth in the region.
Based on official data compiled by financial data provider Wind, the Post has calculated the share of exports from some major Asian economies to the United States, as a percentage of national gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023 – used as one indicator to delve into their dependency and exposure to potential risks.
Below are our findings, ranked by the level of their dependency on the US market. The first entry, Vietnam, depends most on the US market among these six trade partners, while China’s place on the list could be surprising.

Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited (""Standard Chartered Hong Kong"") and LIFTWOMEN® announced the launch of “SC WIN Now & Next Challenge”, a new initiative under Standard Chartered's Women's International Network (""SC WIN""). The programme will leverage SC WIN’s global network and resources, alongside LiftWomen®’s extensive experience and expertise in supporting women entrepreneurs, to offer 10 selected entrepreneurs an 8-week ""LiftHER Global Accelerator Programme"". Five winners will be awarded a total of HKD 1 million in grants and professional training to support their business growth.
The launch event of the ""SC WIN Now & Next Challenge"" brought together prominent women entrepreneurs from the startup and business communities, celebrating the inaugural launch of the programme and learning about Standard Chartered's enhanced support for SMEs which is to strengthen their financial capabilities and develop business skills for expansion. According to the research by ""Women of Hong Kong"", SC WIN's Hong Kong partner, women entrepreneurs generally face limited access to funding channels. SC WIN was established to provide comprehensive support to women entrepreneurs through three key pillars: delivering products tailored to various business development stages, creating platforms to connect markets, client communities, suppliers and entrepreneurs across different regions, and assisting SMEs in formulating development and expansion strategies.
As a new initiative under SC WIN, the “SC WIN Now & Next Challenge” targets women entrepreneurs who have successfully established their business models and are now poised for growth and market expansion. The programme is expected to attract over a hundred local women entrepreneurs to apply. Ten outstanding participants will be selected to join the 8-week LiftHER Global Accelerator Programme, where they will gain in-depth understanding of business operations and industry trends to refine their business strategies. The finalists will compete in a pitching challenge in late August for five awards.
Mary Huen, CEO, Hong Kong and Greater China & North Asia, Standard Chartered, said, ""Standard Chartered Hong Kong is committed to supporting SMEs development. By collaborating with chambers and industry associations, we would help SMEs transform through digitalisation, cross-border expansion, and sustainability initiatives. To support women entrepreneurs to take their business to the next level, we launched SC WIN in Hong Kong in October 2023, offering a suite of lending solutions and networking events that enable them to connect for better business opportunities. The new addition of ‘SC WIN Now & Next Challenge’ will bring more benefits to the SMEs by providing them with better exposure and tools to strengthen their brand competitiveness and business skills to capture the upcoming growth opportunities which will inject new impetus into Hong Kong’s economic development."""

If Trump aims not just to strike a deal, but to prove that he can succeed where others have failed, several questions should be addressed: Was Kim genuinely willing to trade nuclear weapons for a bright future, and if so, is this still his intention? Why did Trump fail to strike a deal with Kim in his first term? Can he learn from past failures and succeed in his second term?
If Kim does have a genuine motivation to denuclearise and if Trump has learned from his mistakes, then negotiations can and should be revived during Trump’s second term to consummate a deal.
To answer the question about Kim’s intentions, we must look into why Kim pursued negotiations in 2018 and 2019 and judge whether these motivations are relevant in 2025. Three key pieces of evidence illustrate Kim’s genuine intention to negotiate in 2018 and 2019 and reveal why he is likely to pursue a deal with Trump in the future.
First, Kim has reportedly shared with US officials that he did not want his children to “live their lives carrying nuclear weapons on their back”, signalling a willingness to denuclearise."

Resentments have been piling up for Louis Li since he moved from Guangzhou to a luxury home in Malaysia’s Forest City development about six months ago for his children’s schooling.
Before he began investing in his three units almost a decade ago, Li checked out the property at a “prosperous” time.
“When they started sales, ads were going up all over Guangdong province, so I came to visit,” he recalled. “Lots of people were here then, plus shops, restaurants and the hotel were all open.”
Today, his properties still sit high above a residents-only outdoor pool surrounded by palm gardens. Beyond the gardens lies an artificial beach along the calm Straits of Johor overlooking Singapore.
But Li has nothing good to say about the place any more.
The 26,000-unit Forest City – set off from urban Johor Bahru on an artificial spit of land near the tip of the Malaysian peninsula – lacks a supermarket, which is inconvenient when he and his children, aged seven and eight, need groceries not available at the local convenience store, Li grumbled. A shopping centre trip requires 30 to 40km (18 to 25 miles) of car travel.
Standing beside the tower’s basketball court on a muggy Monday night in February, Li said Forest City’s retailers enjoyed better fortunes before the Covid-19 pandemic. Just a handful of shops visibly operate now in the 3 sq km (1.16 square mile) compound. Trash easily accumulates in public spaces."

Beijing lowered the yuan’s daily reference rate only slightly on Wednesday, despite the offshore yuan hitting a record low overnight, signalling China’s determination to stabilise its currency amid an ever-escalating trade war with the United States.
Just hours before the second Trump administration was due to increase its additional tariffs on all US imports from China to 104 per cent – taking the total US duty level on China to around 115 per cent – the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) allowed the yuan to further weaken against the US dollar, setting its daily fixing rate – also known as the midpoint rate – at 7.2066 per US dollar.
On Tuesday it set the rate at 7.2038, marking the first time the yuan had fallen below the psychologically significant 7.2 threshold since September 2023.
“Facing the current tariff pressures, the central bank has widened the yuan’s trading band to fully acknowledge the stress in the foreign exchange market, while sending a clear signal of its determination to defend the currency’s stability – this policy stance leaves no room for speculation against the yuan,” Wang said.
The central bank’s intention was to guide sentiment, reassure markets and maintain control, rather than helping exporters to continue selling their products to the US, she added.
“The PBOC will seek to stabilise, not devalue, currency amid a trade war,” Wang said."

Panama’s sweeping financial audit of CK Hutchison Holdings’ decades-long canal concession could provide the embattled Hong Kong conglomerate with an “acceptable” justification for relinquishing its ports in the country, international relations experts have said.
But they said questions remained about how the audit would affect the rest of a US$23 billion ports deal between tycoon Li Ka-shing’s conglomerate and a consortium led by US investment firm BlackRock.
Some argued there was no “risk-free” exit for the Hong Kong company now that it was under pressure from three sides.
Anel Flores, Panama’s comptroller general, presented the results of the sweeping financial audit on Tuesday, in which he accused CK Hutchison of depriving the country of more than US$1.3 billion through the decades-old port concession.
He also described the concession as being “negotiated against the republic”.
His team also said it found evidence of accounting irregularities and the use of phantom companies linked to CK Hutchison’s Panama Ports Company."

Hong Kong cricket chief Burji Shroff has warned that only increased access to facilities, more grounds and greater government support will allow the city’s men’s and women’s teams to improve.
Following one-sided losses to Uganda and Italy in February’s Challenge League, which Shroff called “disappointing to say the least”, Hong Kong’s men have minimal hope of attaining cherished one-day international status until 2030 at the earliest.
Ahead of hosting Nepal, Kuwait and Qatar for a quadrangular series, from Wednesday to Sunday, Hong Kong are No 23 in the T20I world rankings, with women in 22nd.
“It’s not a favourable position for us right now,” said Shroff, chairman of Cricket Hong Kong, China (CHK).
The city has one venue, Tin Kwong Road Recreation Ground in Kowloon, capable of regularly staging international cricket, while most of the players have work commitments.
Shroff said the “government have been good with us”, in granting increased access to Tin Kwong Road over the past 12 months. “We’re still desperately short, though … and we need more use of other grounds,” Shroff added."

NHK President Nobuo Inaba acknowledged in March that footage from the documentary Midori Naki Shima (The Island That Has No Green) was not filmed on location at Hashima Island and could not be verified as authentic.
However, he stopped short of addressing the broadcaster’s editorial choices on air – a silence critics said undermined his admission.
The documentary was filmed and originally broadcast in 1955, a decade after Japan’s surrender and after Koreans in Japan and its other territories had been permitted to return to the Korean peninsula.
“NHK has admitted that the images used in the documentary were inaccurate but they are still refusing to report the lies that they told,” said Hiromichi Moteki, acting secretary general of the Tokyo-based Society for the Dissemination of Historical Fact. “It is absolutely ridiculous.”
Moteki accused NHK of being “controlled by leftists” who had for many years been highly critical of Japan’s imperialist expansion and colonial rule in the early 20th century. He also alleged that the broadcaster’s handling of the documentary raised broader concerns about impartiality in its other programming."

Optimists always say that with every challenge comes new opportunities.
But with the economically illiterate US President Donald Trump single-handedly unleashing a new dawn of American protectionism, sending stock indices falling and world markets into a tailspin, things are looking bleak and may get worse.
Maybe there’s a bright side to focus on, however.
For those of us in Hong Kong, which is still one of the freest ports in the world, the situation hopefully is not so bad. In fact, there might even be a chance to take advantage of the turmoil.
Some of the countries hit hardest by tariffs are Asia’s major factory producers, including Vietnam, Thailand and, of course, China. Assuming these countries’ American sales will now decline, all those surplus goods will have to go somewhere else, right?"

We are not advising [them] to buy the dip. This is a time for caution.”
Citigroup was more confident about recommending the safety of short-maturity bonds, hedge funds, gold and non-correlated assets, he said, adding that some structured notes that have some downside protection would also be appropriate to own. His team hosted a webcast for 1,200 clients across Asia before the market tumble on Monday.

A day of dizzying geopolitical swings ended with the White House announcing that additional 50 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports would go into effect on Wednesday.
But in the morning, Trump seemed to attempt to accommodate Beijing, posting on his Truth Social account that China “wants to make a deal, badly, but they don’t know how to get it started.
“We are waiting for their call. It will happen!”
That somewhat conciliatory note itself followed a more confrontational message from Monday, when Trump warned Beijing to back down from its retaliatory threats or “all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!”
The muscle-flexing came as Trump’s lieutenants tried to frame the administration’s rapid shifts about its tariffs programme as consistent and likely to produce its stated goals of boosting US manufacturing, generating “trillions of dollars in revenue” and spurring US economic prosperity.
Most economists say the programme risks fuelling inflation in the US as well as a highly destructive global trade war."

Trump’s fascination with McKinley is perhaps shaped by his other, sometimes overlooked, legacy. McKinley presided over the US’ largest territorial expansion outside North America. After the Spanish-American War of 1898, the US gained control of Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines, before annexing Hawaii in 1900.
But can Trump really go down in the annals of American history as the president who made America bigger? While once the US acquired territory from the declining Spanish empire, it now faces a formidable rising power in China. Is territorial expansion even wise in this day and age?"

The United States will take back the Panama Canal from Chinese influence, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Tuesday during a visit to the Central American nation.
Hegseth, following talks with Panama’s government, vowed to deepen cooperation and said China would not be allowed to “weaponise” the canal by using Chinese firms’ commercial relationships for espionage.
“Together, we will take back the Panama Canal from China’s influence,” Hegseth said.
Speaking after a meeting with Panama President José Raúl Mulino, Hegseth alluded to ports at either end of the canal that are controlled by a Hong Kong consortium, which is in the process of selling its controlling stake to another consortium including BlackRock Inc.
“China-based companies continue to control critical infrastructure in the canal area,” Hegseth said.
“That gives China the potential to conduct surveillance activities across Panama. This makes Panama and the United States less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign. And as President Donald Trump has pointed out, that situation is not acceptable.”"

Opposition to tariffs on imports from US allies like Canada may be unsurprising. But a majority of Americans – including nearly a quarter of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents – also believe tariffs on Chinese goods hurt the US, according to a survey released on Tuesday.
Conducted from March 24 through 30, the survey of 1,801 American adults occurred after the Donald Trump administration had already imposed two rounds of 10 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports.
The findings are “tacking against the narrative” that tariffs on Chinese imports are good for Americans, said Jack Zhang, a political scientist at the University of Kansas, and reflect growing public awareness of the effects of tariffs.

US lawmakers reintroduced a bill on Tuesday that could close Hong Kong’s representative offices in America if the White House determines that Beijing has undermined the city’s autonomy, an effort that failed in the previous congressional session.
The bill would amend the US State Department’s annual review of Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous status to require the US president to explain to Congress why the three Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices (HKETOs) in the country should retain or lose diplomatic privileges.
It seeks to block efforts to “knowingly assist in the promotion of Hong Kong as a free and autonomous city or [the Hong Kong government] as committed to protecting the human rights of people of Hong Kong or fully maintaining the rule of law required for human rights and economic prosperity” if the State Department determines that the city has lost its autonomy.
The revival of the bill by Representatives Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican, and James McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, is the latest in a series of US government efforts targeting Hong Kong that stretch back to US President Donald Trump’s first term in the White House.
“At one time, the HKETOs represented a city whose prosperity was based on its protection of the fundamental human rights and freedom of the Hong Kong people – but the Hong Kong all of us knew and respected is gone,” said Smith.
“HKETOs are pushing out Chinese Communist Party propaganda and spying on Hong Kongers living in the United States – this must stop.”"

The driver allegedly failed to notice the cyclist before the collision. A breathalyser test reportedly returned a zero reading."

Billionaire presidential adviser Elon Musk attacked White House trade counsellor Peter Navarro as “dumber than a sack of bricks” as a fight over US President Donald Trump’s tariff regime spilled onto social media on Tuesday.
In a flurry of posts, Musk called Navarro “truly a moron” and mocked the trade adviser for previously citing the work of “Ron Vara” – a fictional expert whose name is an anagram of his own.
The missives were the latest volley in an increasingly bitter row between the two that broke out after Trump last week announced that he was imposing a minimum 10 per cent tariff on most imports, with additional levies on around 60 countries that have larger trade deficits with the US.
The announcement was seen as a policy win for Navarro, who has advocated aggressive trade measures in hopes of helping to boost domestic manufacturing.
Shortly after the announcement, Musk jabbed at Navarro by saying his degree in economics from Harvard was “a bad thing, not a good thing” and criticised the trade adviser for not having built companies on his own.
Navarro, in a subsequent interview with CNBC, said the criticism was not surprising from the Tesla CEO because he was a “car assembler” who used parts from other countries."

Rami Malek shone in Mr. Robot, his breakout TV drama about cybersecurity and hackers, and it seems that ever since, he has been seeking something similar.
Malek plays Charles Heller, a CIA cryptographer working at Langley, Virginia. When his wife (Rachel Brosnahan) is murdered in a terrorist attack in London, the distraught Charlie has only one thing on his mind: revenge.
Confronting his bosses, he demands mission-specific training. To shut him up, they agree, putting him with Laurence Fishburne’s Colonel Henderson, who soon realises that Charlie does not have the mettle to be a cold-blooded killer.
Undeterred, Charlie sets about using the skills he does have, tracking down the four people involved in Sarah’s death, starting in Paris. It is almost like watching the polar opposite of Liam Neeson’s Taken character chase down the bad guys."

The developer expected to reach a sellout by the end of the day. All 119 flats in the first batch sold on Wednesday.
The one- to three-bedroom flats were priced between HK$2.98 million (US$373,000) and HK$10.57 million, or an average of HK$11,671 per square foot after discounts, 5 per cent higher than the first batch.
On Saturday, Henderson Land Development sold 40 out of 55 units it offered at Eight Southpark in Kowloon City, fetching some HK$188 million in total. The flats, measuring from 200 sq ft to 351 sq ft, were priced between HK$3.37 million and HK$8.1 million.

Hong Kong has seen no “significant seizures” of smuggled ivory and pangolin scales since 2021, the government has said, attributing it to heavier penalties while animal rights groups pointed to international efforts in tackling the illegal wildlife trade as also helping.
In a written reply to the legislature on Tuesday, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department said the number of smuggling cases involving products from some highly endangered species, such as elephant ivory, pangolins and rhino horn, had “dropped significantly” with increased prosecution and penalties.
“Since 2021, there have been no significant smuggling cases of elephant ivory or pangolin scales seized in Hong Kong, and there has been only one case involving 6.3kg [13.9lbs] of rhinoceros horn in February with an estimated value of around HK$2.5 million (US$322,000),” the department said.
The department said “significant seizures” referred to smuggling cases “with a large quantity of endangered species specimens that are often found in shipping containers”, but did not specify whether it was by volume or market value.
In 2020, two travellers were sentenced to up to 27 months in jail after attempting to smuggle 50kg of pangolin scales from the Democratic Republic of Congo to mainland China via Hong Kong.
The Organised and Serious Crime Ordinance (OSCO) was amended in August 2021 to cover certain wildlife trafficking-related crimes, allowing authorities to secure court orders for documents that would otherwise be inaccessible during investigations. It also enabled judges to apply heavier penalties."

After blasting to an early gain of 4.1 per cent, which would have marked its best day in years, the S&P 500 quickly lost all of it. It then careered to a loss of 3 per cent before paring its drop to 1.6 per cent.
That left the index, which sits at the heart of many investors’ 401(k) accounts, nearly 19 per cent below its record set in February.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 320 points, or 0.8 per cent, after erasing an earlier surge of 1,460 points, while the Nasdaq composite dropped 2.1 per cent.
The shocking swings followed rallies for stocks globally earlier in the day, with indexes up 6 per cent in Tokyo, 2.5 per cent in Paris and 1.6 per cent in Shanghai. But even after those jumps, analysts had been warning to expect more swings up and down for financial markets not just in the days ahead but also the hours.

Four former Hong Kong lawmakers convicted in a landmark subversion case involving 47 activists will be released as early as April 29, becoming the first batch of defendants to be freed following the city’s largest and longest-running national security trial, the Post has learned.
Gary Fan Kwok-wai, Kwok Ka-ki, Jeremy Tam Man-ho and Claudia Mo Man-ching, each of whom was sentenced to four years and two months in prison last November, have been in custody on remand since March 2021.
Sources said on Tuesday that the four would be released “as early as April 29” and planned to “remain low-key and decline media interviews” upon their release.
Fan, 58, is serving his term in Shek Pik Prison, while his fellow lawmakers Kwok and Tam – aged 63 and 49, respectively – are in Stanley Prison. Mo, 68, is being held at the Lo Wu Correctional Institution.
They were among the 45 former politicians and activists convicted of and sentenced for conspiracy to subvert state power under the Beijing-decreed national security law for their involvement in an illegal legislative “primary” election in 2020.
The four, who pleaded guilty to the subversion charge and received the lightest jail term, are expected to be released on April 29 despite not being allowed to have their sentence cut by a third as set out in the city’s Safeguarding National Security Ordinance."

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department said the doubling of fixed penalty levels in 2023 had produced a substantial deterrent effect, reducing the number of notices served to members of the public.
According to written replies to lawmakers shared on Tuesday, the department handed out 31,945 fixed penalty notices for littering in 2024, or an average of 87 a day.
The increase of the fixed fines to HK$3,000 means authorities will generate HK$95.8 million in revenue from last year’s penalty notices.
Authorities also said 3,957 of the fixed penalty notices, alongside 1,250 summonses, were issued to offenders who were caught illegally dumping rubbish at black spots by on-site internet-connected cameras.

If the trade war led to a sharp drop in China’s exports to the US, it would “have a catastrophic impact on the economy and damage people’s livelihoods and social stability”, Zhu said.

In a world first, 10 cyborg cockroaches were deployed to help the Singapore search and rescue team following the 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28.
These insect-robot hybrids are essentially Madagascar hissing cockroaches fitted with tiny “backpacks” containing infrared cameras and sensors to detect human heat signatures, according to The Straits Times newspaper.
As these insects are only 6cm (2 inches) long, they can navigate tiny spaces. Electrodes are used to send signals to their nerves and muscles and control their movements.
The information they gather is fed into a machine-learning algorithm to look for any signs of life, and then sent to engineers on site wirelessly.
They were developed by Singapore’s Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX), together with Nanyang Technological University and Klass Engineering and Solutions.
Although they were still in the developmental stage, the disaster in Myanmar spurred HTX to fast-track the prototypes.
HTX flew them and four engineers to join the Singapore Civil Defence Force’s (SCDF) 80-strong Operation Lionheart, where they were used in some of the worst-hit areas, including Mandalay and the capital Naypyidaw."

China condemns US Vice-President J.D. Vance's comments calling Chinese ‘peasants’
Lin was responding to a media query on comments made by Vance in an interview with Fox News last Thursday, a day after US President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on most trading partners – including an extra 34 per cent on Chinese imports.
Defending the levies, Vance said: “We borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things those Chinese peasants manufacture.
“That is not a recipe for economic prosperity, that’s not a recipe for lower prices, and that’s not a recipe for good jobs in the United States of America.”
The “Chinese peasants” remark prompted widespread criticism on Western social media platforms. Many pointed out the irony as Vance once used his own difficult childhood in rural, poverty-stricken Appalachia as a political selling point.
Vance’s 2016 autobiography is titled Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis."

The subject replaced liberal studies, which was overhauled in 2021 following criticism by pro-establishment lawmakers, who blamed it for fuelling youth violence during the 2019 social unrest. They also said some teaching materials were biased.
The new subject focuses on understanding national security and strengthening pupils’ sense of national identity.
One question this year asked candidates to discuss how China could expand its international influence through foreign aid based on materials provided and their own knowledge. Another question asked them to explain how such aid could improve the lives of those who received it.
The materials provided included a photo of trainees learning about caring for newborn babies in a programme organised by China in Tanzania in 2017."

Malaysia was the world’s third-largest producer of solar photovoltaic (PV) components – the inexpensive, essential parts used in solar panels – in 2022, and was also a major supplier of polysilicon, another critical material in solar manufacturing.
However, the new tariffs on these nations announced by Trump last week – including 24 per cent on Malaysian products – are set to drastically escalate the costs for US importers and intensify pressure on the region’s solar industry.
Southeast Asia’s major economies have tied their growth strategies to the clean energy transition – but experts warn that the US shift back to fossil fuels could slow their progress."

Naura Technology Group, China’s top chip equipment maker, said it expects a sharp rise in revenue and profit for the first quarter of 2025, after reporting strong performance in 2024, highlighting the country’s progress towards semiconductor self-sufficiency.
The Beijing-based company, a key equipment supplier for the domestic chip industry, said in a corporate filing on Tuesday that final figures for the first three months of 2025 could see revenue up by as much as 51 per cent year on year to 8.98 billion yuan (US$1.2 billion). Net profit is expected to rise as much as 53 per cent to 1.74 billion yuan.
It teased the quarterly numbers after reporting a 44.2 per cent surge in net profit in 2024 to 5.6 billion yuan. Revenue was up 35.1 per cent year on year to 29.8 billion yuan, marking the third consecutive year of growth for the Shenzhen-listed firm.
Naura attributed its strong performance to technological breakthroughs in new etching and deposition products, which helped boost revenue and market share.
The company’s growth comes as China intensifies efforts to reduce reliance on US technologies and chip tool providers such as California-based Lam Research and Applied Materials.
Naura recently climbed two spots in a global ranking of semiconductor equipment suppliers, coming in sixth by revenue for 2024, according to a report from Chinese research firm CINNO. It is the only Chinese company among the world’s top 10 chip tool vendors."

“We have the documents of these prisoners, bank cards, and personal data,” Zelensky said in a post that included a video of one of the alleged Chinese prisoners.
The video showed a man wearing military fatigues with his hands bound, mimicking sounds from combat and uttering a small number of words in Mandarin, during an apparent interview with a Ukrainian official not pictured.

Crews were searching for potential survivors in the rubble at the one-storey Jet Set nightclub in Santo Domingo, said Juan Manuel Mendez, director of the Centre of Emergency Operations.
“The death toll has risen to 113 this morning,” Mendez said.
More than 24 hours after the top of the nightclub collapsed down onto patrons, rescue crews were still pulling out survivors from under the debris, shushing those around them so they could listen for faint cries for help.
Firefighters removed blocks of broken concrete and sawed planks of wood to use them as planks to lift heavy debris as the noise of drills breaking through concrete filled the air.

The run on Apple’s stores is only one example of the widespread panic setting in for a consumer base that is still reliant on Chinese goods, and their tacit understanding these products cannot be simply or quickly swapped for items from alternative sources – certainly not at the low costs to which they have become accustomed.
Though this time of year is traditionally a lean season for smartphone sales, Apple’s inventory is being shuttled rapidly from China – and India, another major supplier swept up in Trump’s tariff blitz – to the US while demand is hot.
More generally, electronics and electrical machinery was the US’ largest import category from China by value, with US$119.9 billion shipped in 2023."

An international scientific team unearthed some 3,500 stone artefacts at a site in Yunnan province, and dated them to between 60,000 and 50,000 years old.
Some stone tools showed key features of Quina technology – a tradition associated with Neanderthals living in cold, arid European environments around 70,000 to 40,000 years ago.
The team of archaeologists, based in Australia, China, France, Italy, Spain and the United States, published their findings last week in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.
The Middle Paleolithic, or Middle Stone Age, which lasted from around 300,000 to 40,000 years ago, was a critical period in human evolution. In Africa, it was closely associated with the origin and evolution of early modern humans, while in Eurasia, it was linked to the development of different archaic human groups, such as the Neanderthals and Denisovans, the team said in contextualising its findings.
It was previously believed that early hominids in China showed slow technological development, particularly in adopting Middle Paleolithic advancements. But the new discoveries might change this idea, according to the paper."

As Asean looks to present a united front in response to US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, there is growing consensus among analysts that the region should diversify its trade and boost regional integration to deal with growing uncertainties in the global economy.
Countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are among the hardest hit by the reciprocal tariffs announced by the Trump administration last week. Vietnam and Cambodia were hit with steep tariffs of 46 per cent and 49 per cent, respectively, while Indonesia received a 32 per cent rate, and Malaysia a 24 per cent rate.
Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who chairs Asean this year, said on Sunday that his country would “lead efforts to present a united regional front” in the wake of the tariffs and ensure “Asean’s collective voice is heard clearly and firmly on the international stage”.
Anwar also shared a Facebook post stating he had spoken with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh on the phone on Monday and held a meeting with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto who flew into Kuala Lumpur on Sunday evening.
So far, Asean members have not retaliated against the tariffs and instead called for engagement with the US. Vietnam and Thailand have reached out to Washington for ways to reduce their tariff rates to protect their export-dependent economies.
Analysts warn that some Asean members’ efforts to appease the US could lead to competition among them to persuade Washington to adjust the original tariffs in their favour, potentially harming the region as a whole."

“Let us not be naive about China,” Secretary General Mark Rutte told the Japan Times.
“The build-up of their armed forces and investments in their defence industry, and in their defence capabilities, is staggering,” Rutte said in the interview published on Monday.
The comment came as he visited the Yokosuka naval base and a Japanese defence contractor on Tuesday before meeting defence minister Gen Nakatani to call for further cooperation.
“Nato and Japan share the same values, and we face many of the same challenges,” Rutte told Nakatani.
“China, North Korea and Russia are stepping up their military exercises and their cooperation, undermining global stability, and that means what happens in the Euro-Atlantic matters for the Indo-Pacific and vice versa."

Hong Kong’s community of “masters” athletes has been tipped to grow after the city brought home bagfuls of medals from the past two global championships.

Whittington also expected to see the city sending a large team to the next World Masters Athletics Championships (WMAC) in Daegu next year.
WMAC are the biennial championships for masters athletics – aged 35 or above – which is divided into five-year age groups. For example, the M35 group is for male athletes aged 35 to 39 years while the W40 group is for female athletes between the ages of 40 and 44, and so on.

Already the world’s largest producer of many farm products, China has plans to kick agriculture modernisation up a notch and become a “strong agricultural country” over the next quarter-century – invigorating rural areas as food security and a gaping rural-urban divide remain persistent challenges.
The country, where most farmers still operate on a relatively small scale, aims to improve standards in farming supplies, scientific and technological equipment, and industrial resilience and competitiveness by 2050, according to a plan issued on Monday.
The blueprint, jointly released by the Communist Party’s Central Committee and the State Council, came as Beijing has put “food security” high on its agenda amid elevated global economic uncertainties and an intensifying trade war with the United States.
The plan underpins Beijing’s vision for a prosperous, modernised China in 25 years – a vision being hindered by a big income gap between cities and the rural areas where a third of its 1.4 billion people live.

Under-16s will be unable to use Instagram’s live-streaming feature without parental permission, part of an update to the site’s parental controls.
Meta said Instagram users under the age of 16 would need parental permission to turn off a feature which automatically blurs images suspected to contain nudity within direct messages.
The updates are an expansion of the social media giant’s Teen Accounts system, which it introduced last September, and places any users under 16 into a Teen Account by default, which automatically makes an account private, reduces messaging capabilities and puts the user into the strictest category of Meta’s sensitive content settings.
The tech giant said it was also beginning to roll out Teen Accounts to both Facebook and Facebook Messenger.
Since September, it said around 54 million teens globally had been moved onto Teen Accounts, and that this figure would continue to grow as it expanded the availability of the settings.
“These are major updates that have fundamentally changed the experience for teens on Instagram,” Meta said in a blog post."

Hongkongers can expect a cooler weekend due to a cold front moving across southern China on Saturday, according to the local forecaster.
In a forecast published on Tuesday, the Hong Kong Observatory said that temperatures on Saturday would reach as low as 19 degrees Celsius (66.2 Fahrenheit) before hitting a minimum of 18 degrees on Sunday.
The forecaster attributed the cooler weather to a trough of low pressure that would form over central China in the run-up to the weekend and develop into a cold front.
“The cold front is expected to move across Guangdong on Saturday,” it said. “The associated showers and squally thunderstorms will affect the region.”
On Tuesday, mercury readings in Hong Kong ranged from 21 to 27 degrees. The weather is also expected to be warm, humid and misty over the next few days."

A Hong Kong court has sentenced a handyman to one year in prison for posting seditious messages on his social media accounts to incite hatred towards central and local authorities.
Chow Kim-ho, 57, on Tuesday pleaded guilty to one count of knowingly publishing seditious publications under the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance, which was passed by lawmakers in March of last year.
A source earlier said the defendant was a former member of the League of Social Democrats opposition party.
He admitted to publishing 145 seditious posts on Facebook, Instagram and Threads, involving content intended to incite hatred towards the Communist Party of China and the Hong Kong government.
Chow told police that he had reposted news articles, photos and videos on his social media accounts between March 26 and November 12 last year, with the content including comments from himself that were intended to “let off some steam”.
In posts about the country’s ruling party, he said that “its fall in history was bound to happen”. Other remarks targeted Hong Kong authorities or discussed the possibility of a war between Taiwan and mainland China.
During sentencing, Chief Magistrate So Wai-tak of West Kowloon Court said Chow’s frequent reposting of seditious material, which could easily be viewed by the public, “set a tone” that focused on overthrowing the central government."

His bereaved family is now calling on the operator of Japan’s largest convenience store chain to improve labour management practices for its franchise employees.
Karoshi or “death from overwork” remains a persistent issue in Japan since it first came to light several decades ago.
Although the government introduced regulations in 2018 to limit overtime hours to 45 a month and 100 in busier months, companies have found ways to skirt these rules.
“Around the time he was appointed manager of the store, his duties increased, such as filling in for part-time workers who were suddenly absent, and he could no longer take time off,” the man’s widow told The Asahi Shimbun newspaper."

Israel’s top court began a hearing on Tuesday on the hotly contested decision to sack domestic security chief Ronen Bar, with protests from government supporters and critics briefly interrupting the proceedings.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced last month that his government had unanimously approved a motion to dismiss the head of the Shin Bet internal security agency, citing “lack of trust” and requiring Bar to leave his post by April 10.
The hearing on Tuesday follows petitions filed by opposition parties and non-profit groups, challenging the legality of the government’s move which the Supreme Court had already frozen until a ruling was made.
Protests were held outside the Jerusalem courtroom, and inside, shouts and interruptions forced the judges to halt proceedings after only 30 minutes.
“No court in the world is run this way,” said Supreme Court President Yitzhak Amit after warning government supporters and critics who interrupted the hearing, which is broadcast live.
Amit called for a recess, during which scuffles between the sides continued outside the courtroom."

China has rapidly narrowed the gap with the US in producing cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) models, according to research published by Stanford University in California.
When measured using major AI evaluating benchmarks, the performance difference of Chinese models compared with their US counterparts shrank from double digits in 2023 to near parity last year, according to the latest Artificial Intelligence Index report from the Stanford Institute for Human-Centred AI.
For example, the performance gap between Chinese and US models in MMLU, or measuring massive multitask language understanding, narrowed from 17.5 points two years ago to 0.3 by the end of 2024, underscoring the relentless drive by Chinese tech firms to push the frontiers of the technology.

They included Alibaba’s Qwen series and DeepSeek’s V3 foundational model and its R1 reasoning model. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.
“The launch of DeepSeek’s V3 model in December 2024 garnered significant attention, particularly because it achieved exceptionally high performance while requiring far fewer computational resources than many leading [AI models],” the Stanford report said."

The first official meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus has offered a tentative step towards mending strained ties between their countries, though analysts warn that deep-seated mistrust and regional rivalries still cast a long shadow.
Held on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC summit in Thailand, their meeting on Friday marked the first formal contact between India and Bangladesh’s transitional administration since the abrupt collapse of Sheikh Hasina’s government last August, following weeks of student-led demonstrations and rising unrest.
Ties between the South Asian neighbours have steadily deteriorated since Hasina, long seen as a close ally of New Delhi, fled Bangladesh and took refuge in India. Her sudden departure not only removed a reliable partner but also left India scrambling to recalibrate its foreign policy towards a new leadership seen as more open to other powers.
The meeting between Yunus and Modi was described by Dhaka as “very constructive and fruitful”, while Delhi said both leaders had agreed that all bilateral issues would be addressed “through constructive discussions”.
Yet behind the diplomatic niceties, the two leaders are reported to have had more pointed exchanges. According to accounts in local media, Yunus urged Modi to restrain Hasina – now in refuge in India – from making “incendiary remarks”, while Modi in turn asked Bangladesh’s interim leader to avoid rhetoric that could “poison the atmosphere”.
While the meeting offered a rare moment of dialogue, analysts said it was less a breakthrough than a tactical pause – a chance for both sides to take stock after months of turbulence and shifting regional alignments."

“Our military conducted warning broadcasts and warning shots after about 10 North Korean soldiers crossed the military demarcation line (MDL) in the eastern area of the demilitarised zone (DMZ) around 5.00pm local time,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a text message to reporters.
“Our military is closely monitoring the North Korean military’s activity and taking necessary measures according to the operational procedures,” JCS said.
Some of the North Korean soldiers were armed, according to the South Korean military.
Bloodshed and violent confrontations have occasionally occurred at the heavily fortified border, called the Demilitarized Zone. But when North Korean troops briefly violated the border in June last year and prompted South Korea to fire warning shots, it did not escalate into a major source of tensions. South Korean officials assessed that the soldiers did not deliberately commit the border intrusion, and the site was a wooded area and military demarcation line signs there weren’t clearly visible. South Korea said the North Koreans were carrying construction tools.
The motive for Tuesday’s border crossing by North Korean soldiers wasn’t immediately clear."

Eustace revelled in a first Hong Kong treble on Sunday and the 32-year-old is eyeing more momentum when he saddles four runners – Brave Witness, Colourful King, Jumbo Fortune and Charity Together – at the midweek meeting.
Colourful King has raced twice in Hong Kong, winning his most recent effort by a nose over the reopposing Youthful Spirits.
“He did it by the barest of margins. It certainly looked like luck went our way that night and it’s good to get the win obviously. He’s a horse who I think will continue to improve,” said Eustace of Colourful King, who has drawn gate four.

“He’s the type of horse who is a still a bit nervy and a bit unsure of himself, so I think he can gradually improve with the more racing he has. It was great to get the win and hopefully he can keep progressing.
“It does look like they’ll go fairly quick and he has a nice gate to stalk and be strong late. The encouraging thing for me as well is that he looks like he’ll get 1,200m, especially around the Valley when asked to. It does just give us options.”
Eustace has 23 wins through his first season training in Hong Kong. His treble last weekend came via Regency Happy Star, Good Luck Babe and Sea Sapphire.
“You obviously don’t go expecting that by any means but I thought we had a strong hand and the horses were racing well. Hoping to get one, maybe two but to get three was a great thrill. It shows the horses are in good form and the staff are working hard and well,” Eustace said.

Meanwhile, Matthew Poon Ming-fai worked two key FWD Champions Day hopes in barrier trials on Tuesday morning ahead of the HK$74 million Sha Tin showcase on April 27.
Stepping out in the first heat ahead of a possible Group One Chairman’s Sprint Prize (1,200m) return, Lucky Sweynesse broke smoothly from the wide draw before picking up between runners to win in 57.95 seconds over 1,000m on turf at Sha Tin.
“I think with every trial he is getting better and better. Now he is almost ready to race – if he pulls up well, then he is almost ready to race,” Poon said.
Ahead of his clash with Australian star Mr Brightside in the Group One Champions Mile, Voyage Bubble impressed Poon as he crossed the line first over a mile on turf.
“He jumped super, he knows what to do – he travelled nicely and relaxed. I just asked him a little bit and he quickens. How good is that?” Poon said."

China accused the US of lacking sincerity on trade talks on Tuesday as US President Donald Trump renewed tariff threats against Beijing.
China has been hardest hit with a 34 per cent tariff, which was added to existing duties of 20 per cent introduced over the past two months.
China quickly retaliated on Friday with a reciprocal 34 per cent tariff on all US imports to take effect on Thursday. It also imposed export controls on critical minerals and 16 American defence and tech companies.
Trump wrote on social media on Monday that if Beijing did not withdraw the 34 per cent tariffs by Tuesday, he would impose an additional 50 per cent tariff on China from Wednesday."

He was editing his new film, Magellan, when he began vomiting blood. “I almost died from tuberculosis. I vomited blood four times. It was scary,” he says.
When we met for this interview, the 66-year-old was sitting in a hotel in Doha, Qatar. “This is the first time that I’ve got out of the Philippines [since then],” he explains. “I’m still on medication.”
He seems entirely calm, but then he is no stranger to death.
Born in Columbio, Mindanao, Diaz grew up in a world where you would need to walk miles to see a doctor, where everything from crocodiles to the common cold could kill.
He almost died “at the age of four, the age of eight, and … in 2004 as well, I almost died of cancer. I still have the scars.”"

With its forceful response to US President Donald Trump’s new tariffs, China has abandoned courtesy, leaving the chances of reconciliation slim as ties between the world’s two largest economies grow increasingly fraught, according to a prominent economist.
“Initially, China opted to maintain some courtesy to avoid too much escalation when Trump [first] hiked tariffs,” said Mao Zhenhua, an economics professor with the University of Hong Kong and co-director of Renmin University’s Institute of Economic Research.
Trump announced a cumulative 20 per cent increase to tariffs on Chinese goods after taking office in January. Last week, as part of a sweeping package of import duties on nearly every US trade partner, the president levied an additional 34 per cent.
“The probability for both sides to meet for talks or even a turnaround is very small,” Mao added, warning all parties to “brace for impact”."

Hong Kong authorities have proposed providing more tax exemptions for transit travellers as lawmakers voiced concerns that raising the air passenger departure levy could divert visitors to neighbouring competitors.
Andrew Lai Chi-wah, permanent secretary for the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, said on Tuesday that a further relaxation of the air passenger departure tax would be considered, including extending the exemption to travellers leaving the next day.
“Other international airports have a 24-hour exemption, and our arrangement can be more liberal than that,” Lai said during a Legislative Council meeting.
“So if you arrive shortly after midnight and the flight is on the next day, it means you can stay for longer, almost 48 hours without paying the tax.”
Starting on October 1, the city will increase its air departure tax from HK$120 (US$15.40) to HK$200 per passenger. The move is expected to generate about HK$1.6 billion per year in government revenue."

I happened to work on a temporary project at Art Basel – a VIP Lounge for a major host partner and property developer. Having witnessed the art enthusiasts coming and going from the fair at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, I knew March would end on a high note.
The VIP lounge might have been small but it represented a big idea. The developer had a vision of truly recycling materials from their previous projects for this pavilion. We were not asked to specify off-the-shelf products with green labels indicating that they contain recycled materials – a fairly common practice in the industry. Instead, materials were directly harvested from the developer’s decommissioned projects and painstakingly turned into raw materials at the contractor’s factory.
In contrast, true recycling was nothing short of an education. First, the contractor had reservations about the process. Its representatives reminded me that “sustainability has a price”. They had to exert more effort in extracting, cleaning and testing the materials, as well as customising wood and steel panels to our design requirements. Due to the extra man-hours needed to pull this off, labour costs could easily outweigh the sum of purchasing new materials.
Second, while we wanted to use as many recyclables as possible, structural and safety concerns demanded that we use some new materials. Although what the public sees is often just the surface, properly sourcing a display’s supporting elements is just as significant. We knew we couldn’t make the VIP lounge out of only recycled content but we aimed for the most optimal result short of 100 per cent."

And despite Trump’s hard line, some economists said that China is sure to retaliate, as the marginal economic impact of his fresh threats on China is declining as the effective tariff level quickly builds up.
“Currently, the profit margin for China’s export sector is around 30 to 40 per cent,” said Dan Wang, China director at Eurasia Group. “If the US imposes tariffs exceeding 35 per cent, it would wipe out most of their profits – whether the tariff is 70 per cent or even 1,000 per cent makes little difference, as it essentially blocks China from trading directly with the US.
“China will certainly retaliate; it won’t back down.”"

A wide range of economists are voicing alarm over President Donald Trump’s steep tariffs on imports into the United States, sparking a trade war that experts say could tip many countries into recession. Here are comments by some leading economists:
For Thomas Piketty, French author of the bestselling Capital in the Twenty-First Century, “Trumpism is first of all a reaction to the failure of Reaganism” – the liberalisation of president Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.
“Republicans realise that economic liberalism and globalisation have not benefited the middle class as they said they would,” the left-leaning economist said.
“So now they’re using the rest of the world as a scapegoat,” he said. “But it’s not going to work: the Trump cocktail is simply going to generate more inflation and more inequalities.”
In response, “Europe needs to define its own priorities and prepare for the global recession that’s coming” with a massive investment plan in “energy and transport infrastructure, education, research and health”.
Paul Krugman, the Nobel economics prize laureate, said the US was essentially the founder of the modern trade system that had led to lower tariffs over the past decades."

Videos of rodents darting through crowds in Nusantara, the planned capital city on Borneo island, have been making the rounds on Indonesian social media in recent days.
In response, the Nusantara Capital Authority has deployed hundreds of rat traps and promised additional sanitation measures, in a scramble to contain the pest problem before it tarnishes the city’s ambitions of becoming a hi-tech, eco-friendly metropolis.
“This used to be a forested, hilly area,” said Thomas Umbu Pati Tena, the authority’s deputy for development control. “Naturally, there are many old rat nests. But we’re not sitting idle. Our health and community teams are already working on this.”
The US$32 billion project to relocate the national capital from Jakarta – a congested and sinking megacity – to the heart of Borneo has been internationally promoted as a “smart and sustainable” urban hub showcasing climate-conscious design and a reduced ecological footprint.
Construction began in earnest in 2022, with the city slated to eventually house up to 1.9 million residents."

With panic spreading in markets across the globe, world leaders raced over the weekend to make offers to US President Donald Trump to lower tariffs across the board.
The problem, however, is that it is unclear what exactly Trump would find acceptable – or if he even wants to make deals at all. Trump set a high bar on Sunday night, telling reporters that any agreements would need to eliminate bilateral trade deficits.
“To me, a deficit is a loss,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “We’re going to have surpluses or, at worst, we’re going to be breaking even.”
The lack of clarity over Trump’s demands is adding to frustration across the capitals hardest hit by his “Liberation Day” levies, which are set to take effect on Wednesday. With tariff levels set according to deficits, rather than actual reciprocal rates, governments are in the dark about what specifically they can do to avoid getting hammered.
The problem for all governments is that nothing they do can change the outcome of Trump’s formula for calculating the tariffs, according to Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation."

Jayson Wu, the Chinese owner of a furniture factory in Hanoi, has no idea what he will do if US President Donald Trump goes ahead with his unprecedented “Liberation Day” tariffs.
The plan – which will raise US duties on goods from Vietnam by 46 per cent – has not come into effect yet, but it has already hit his business like a bomb.
“My US clients have cancelled all their orders, and the factory has come to a standstill,” Wu said. “I can only wait to see what happens with the tariffs on the 9th. Otherwise, where can I move the factory now? Most Southeast Asian countries are also facing tariffs.”
Wu is one of many Chinese business owners in Vietnam who find themselves facing a dilemma as Trump threatens to launch a full-blown global trade war.
For Chinese businesses, Vietnam offered a way to avoid US duties aimed at China, as well as low labour costs, cheap rent, and stable trade relations with China thanks to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)."

A key change would broaden a provision in restructuring plans, known as cross-class cramdowns, to prevent shareholders from dissenting, according to a Ministry of Law report. The proposals would also streamline the process of disposing a debtor’s property or issuing new shares, and recommend building incentives into restructuring managers’ compensation.
The public consultation period will close on April 8, after which the Ministry of Law will draft a bill to be read in parliament before the proposals are enacted.
The recommendations are the latest in the ministry’s ongoing efforts to refresh insolvency rules under the Companies Act, which the state began years ago to make Singapore’s bankruptcy courts more appealing to investors.
“In the Asian context, where many companies are closely held by families, this could be a significant move if it results in these families losing control in these companies” said Mohan Gopalan, director for corporate restructuring & workouts at law firm Drew & Napier, commenting on the proposed changes on the cross-class cramdown.
In 2016, Singapore went through a similar exercise to update its insolvency law, adopting a set of committee recommendations. They included practices similar to tools laid out in the US bankruptcy code’s Chapter 11, such as offering automatic stay of legal and enforcement actions for debtors.

Hong Kong-born Hiroshi Tai will make history as the first Singaporean golfer to play in the Masters this week, but the 23-year-old can count on a strong Georgia connection to buoy his bid for low amateur honours at Augusta National.
Tai secured his place in the field for the year’s first major almost a year ago, when he won the NCAA collegiate championship representing Georgia Tech.
Georgia Tech is also the alma mater of United States golf great and Augusta National co-founder Bobby Jones – and creates a link to this day between the club and Georgia Tech’s Yellow Jackets teams.
But Tai said on Monday that the drive down Magnolia Lane felt “a little different” when he was arriving to prepare for his first Masters.
“Obviously being at Georgia Tech, there’s a lot of history involved with the Masters with Bobby Jones being a founder and obviously he played at Georgia Tech, graduated from there,” Tai said.
“So there’s a lot of history at Georgia Tech and connected with the Masters. It has been a really cool experience. And driving down Magnolia Lane, not even today, just any other day, would be amazing. Definitely enjoying it a lot.”"

The company, based in Foshan, Guangdong province, is moving forward with efforts to restructure 12.4 billion yuan (US$1.7 billion) in debt as part of a plan to reorganise nine bonds with a total value of 13.5 billion yuan, according to state-owned media outlet The Paper.
For two of the bonds, which previously required a 10 per cent payment on the principal in March, payment has been extended to September. The remaining bonds will be granted a grace period of 60 trading days for the repayment of both principal and interest, according to local media, adding that the developer currently has a total of 20.5 billion yuan in outstanding onshore bonds.
Country Garden did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The latest development was another victory for Country Garden, once China’s largest home builder by sales. The firm’s fortunes started to sour in late 2020 when Beijing implemented its “three red lines” policy to deflate a housing bubble and curb excessive borrowing among developers.
Last week, the company said its 2024 loss attributable to shareholders narrowed to 32.8 billion yuan from a whopping 178 billion yuan loss a year earlier. The 2023 loss was mainly due to steep write-offs on properties that were completed or under development, the company said in its annual report."

Liking a co-worker’s photo on social media. Sending them direct messages. Checking in on Slack more often than before.
Progressively interacting in this way with someone outside your relationship may be no big deal to you. To your significant other, however, it may be microcheating, which some people consider a form of infidelity because it can involve building a bond one heart emoji at a time.
Although pushing the boundaries of what is allowed in a relationship is not a new concept, the issue has become even more common with the rise of remote work, said William Schroeder, a therapist and owner of Just Mind Counselling centres in Austin, in the US state of Texas.
“People are having more digital relationships, so it kind of creates more space for that,” Schroeder said. “In this work-from-home environment, it can happen even easier because it’s real low risk.”
A term popularised by Australian psychologist Melanie Schilling, microcheating could be anything short of a physical or emotional relationship if it involves a behaviour you cannot talk about openly with a partner."

During his first term in office, US President Donald Trump swiftly moved to pull the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership – an ambitious free trade agreement aimed at cementing America’s position in the Asia-Pacific region.
Now, the reinstated US leader may be opening the door to China to join the successor to that agreement, as countries around the world seek to counter his sweeping reciprocal tariff regime, analysts said.
Many expect the rest of the world to close ranks against the US as they seek to stand up to American threats, which could aid China in its long-standing application to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).
China applied to join the grouping in 2021, but its bid remains pending and the CPTPP’s members did not provide an update on the application during November’s joint ministerial meeting in Vancouver."

“The US no longer adheres to free trade, arbitrarily undermining the internationally established rules of world trade, and its ruthless behaviour damages global and multilateral trade,” he said.
On Tuesday, the central government vowed to take “countermeasures” against any move by Washington to further raise tariffs after US President Donald Trump threatened another 50 per cent in duties on Chinese imports unless Beijing lifted retaliatory levies.

His video posted to the social media platform shows the artist’s face, with his signature untamed beard, appearing in black and white on two large outdoor billboards for about four seconds.
His mouth moves silently as traffic and pedestrians stream past. The Instagram post explains what he is mouthing, in English: “You must take part in revolution.” It is a line taken from a 1937 essay, “On Practice”, by late Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong that is also the title of his new graphic novel, written by Emmy-nominated journalist Melissa Chan.
The short video clips, filmed from the street, are undated but the locations of the LED billboards are given: 33A Argyle Street and 6-12 Sai Yeung Choi South Street in Mong Kok – just about the busiest spots in Hong Kong’s most densely populated district.
The Instagram post explains that Badiucao submitted the video work, titled Here and Now, under the pseudonym Andy Chou to the Milan-based Art Innovation Gallery for inclusion in its Hong Kong public art project “Luminance”.
According to an earlier statement by the gallery, “Luminance” was “an immersive exhibition” timed to coincide with Art Basel Hong Kong, the international art fair that ran from March 26-30."

Kimbal Musk joined his brother, Elon, in criticising tariffs, calling US President Donald Trump’s recent moves a “structural, permanent tax on the American consumer”.
“Even if he is successful in bringing jobs on shore through the tariff tax, prices will remain high and the tax on consumption will remain the form of higher prices because we are simply not as good at making all things,” Kimbal Musk, a Tesla Inc. board member, said in a post on X. He added the policy could lead to a cycle of less consumption and less jobs.
Elon Musk’s comments on tariffs featured prominently in a “Saturday Night Live” skit and in comments by Senator Ted Cruz, who said there are “angels and demons” vying for influence as the White House plans to impose the steepest US trade duties in more than a century.
“Elon is one of the angels,” Cruz said on his podcast released on Monday. “This is a good, good voice that is focused on US jobs that I hope the president is listening to.”
Tesla’s stock skyrocketed following Trump’s election, but has fallen more than 50 per cent since closing at a record high in mid-December.
Just a month ago, Kimbal Musk had thanked Trump for supporting Tesla after the electric vehicles were featured at a press conference on the White House lawn. Outside his work with Tesla, Musk also owns a restaurant chain."

The Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management polled 144 companies across a “wide range” of industries between February 28 and March 11, although it did not disclose the names or the number of employees represented.
The survey period started days after Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po announced the government would freeze civil servant pay and axe 10,000 positions as part of efforts to tackle the city’s HK$87.2 billion (US$11.21 billion) deficit.
When asked about whether the government’s move had affected pay adjustments for 2025, 42.7 per cent of the polled companies said they would consider modifying their levels.
Of that proportion, 24.4 per cent said they would consider a pay freeze, while 18.3 per cent indicated they might lower the level of the increase.

History, money and military: why the South China Sea is so important to Beijing
A breakthrough or rapid resolution was unlikely, they said, pointing to the increasingly tense and violent territorial dispute and superpower stand-offs in the busy waterway, marked by heightened maritime tensions and a recent war of words between Beijing and the US-led West.
It came shortly after Wang labelled Manila’s frequent maritime frictions with Beijing “a shadow play” controlled by the US and other Western powers, and accused the US of stoking “big power rivalry” by meddling in Asia.
“Asia is not an arena for big power rivalry,” he added."

Washington’s decision to impose reciprocal tariffs on Chinese goods could force Hong Kong manufacturers to cut jobs or even close down, as many businesses are set to struggle to navigate global trade frictions, analysts have warned.
Experts also said the sweeping tariffs would create a vicious cycle where consumption in the US would greatly diminish due to rising prices for imported goods, resulting in Hong Kong exporters struggling to survive the drop in demand and the risk of interest rate increases.
“The US’ sweeping tariffs have targeted all Chinese, wherever they are. No matter where Chinese exporters relocate, they will be subject to the high tariffs there,” Dennis Ng Kwok-on, vice-president of the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association of Hong Kong, told the Post.
“There is no way out now, and nothing can be done. Chinese manufacturers have moved to other places such as Vietnam and Cambodia to ward off this risk, but now this is inescapable.
“Hong Kong’s manufacturers are set to face staff cuts or even bankruptcies as they can’t stomach the massive tariffs themselves and will pass on the extra cost to consumers, which will drive business down.”
Ng said the only way out could be for such companies to move to Mexico, which was excluded from the latest US tariffs. Mexico is still subject to prior tariffs.
Executive Councillor and lawmaker Jeffrey Lam Kin-fung said a lot of firms in the process of relocating their production lines to Southeast Asian countries had immediately put the move on hold."

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said in a statement that the “explosive eruption” at the summit vent of Kanlaon Volcano began at 5.51am.
The volcano produced “a voluminous bent plume around 4,000 metres tall” that drifted southwest, it said.
Videos posted on social media showed a wide, billowing plume of smoke slowly stretching into the sky. The eruption stopped at 6.47am, the institute reported later.
“We were prepared for the eruption. The families within 4km to 6km were already evacuated during the previous eruption last December,” said John De Asis, a rescue official in Negros Occidental province’s La Castellana municipality."

Christian Sia – a candidate running in next month’s midterm elections to represent Metro Manila’s Pasig City in Congress – was given until Monday to explain why he should not be sanctioned or removed from the ballot under rules banning discriminatory and sexist behaviour. At the time of publication it was unclear if Sia had responded to the commission’s order.
Sonia Wee-Lozada, director of the Commission on Elections (Comelec) Task Force SAFE, issued the show-cause order on Friday after a video of Sia’s remarks during a campaign rally on Thursday went viral.
In the video, the lawyer and accountant – an alumnus of two prestigious Catholic universities – declared: “Any lonely, single mother who is still having her period, let me be clear, she should still be having her period, I will sleep with her for one night.”
Sia has since issued a half-hearted apology, saying the offer was merely a joke since he is married. He blamed his rivals for posting an edited clip online that omitted the audience’s laughter in response to his joke, which he claimed he made to alleviate their boredom."

China’s real estate sector will need to return to stability, after muddling through the past two years of its worst debt crisis, before global fund managers can regain their confidence in high-yield bonds in the nation and across Asia, according to Pimco.
Investors are still nursing losses from a crash among Chinese developers, who contributed to the bulk of the US$200 billion bond defaults since Beijing announced its “three red lines” policy in August 2020. The move to shut funding access to weak borrowers coincided with Covid-19 outbreaks, driving the credit market into an unprecedented slump.
China Evergrande’s collapse in 2024, with some US$20 billion of unpaid dollar-denominated bonds, is emblematic of a lot of failures caused by excessive borrowings and building during the boom years. Scores of peers are still struggling to reorganise their debts and are in and out of court to repay creditors.
“We are very focused on the property sector as a leading indicator of China credit,” said Christian Stracke, president and global head of credit research of the California-based fund manager. “You won’t see a lot of interest in China offshore credit until there’s a stabilisation in the property market.”

China’s junk-rated developers were the most prolific debt issuers in Asia over the past two decades, offering juicy yields to entice global fund managers. They commanded more than 50 per cent weight in JPMorgan Chase’s Asian credit benchmark in 2020, before falling to less than 30 per cent at the end of last year, according to Nikko Asset Management."

Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings deprived Panama of more than US$1.3 billion through a decades-old ports concession that was “negotiated against the Republic”, Panama’s comptroller general said Monday, citing the results of a sweeping financial audit.
Presenting the findings at a press conference in Panama City, Anel Flores said the contract signed in 1997 with Hutchison’s Panama Ports Company (PPC) ran counter to national interests, and accused former officials of favouring private interests over the state.
“Those Panamanians negotiated for themselves, not for the Republic of Panama,” Flores said. He called the concession “abusive” and said the amounts paid to the state were little more than “a tip”.
The audit was launched on January 20, the same day US President Donald Trump was inaugurated.

The latest round of People’s Liberation Army exercises around Taiwan illustrates a fundamental disconnect in how Washington and Beijing interpret policy signals. This disconnect stems from different points of policy emphasis and anxieties on both sides of the Pacific.
Beijing fears being boxed out of its political position that both sides of the strait belong to one China and thus responds forcefully to political signalling of strengthened ties between the US and Taiwan. Meanwhile, the US fears that Beijing will use force to resolve the Taiwan issue, thus responding to Beijing’s military signals with political support. This downward spiral must be examined and discussed at high levels to bring stability to the Taiwan Strait."

US President Donald Trump said on Monday that the United States and Iran were beginning direct talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme, a surprise announcement after Iranian officials had appeared to rebuff US calls for such negotiations.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi confirmed the meeting on Tuesday, saying the talks will take place in Oman on Saturday.
“It is as much an opportunity as it is a test. The ball is in America’s court,” Araghchi said in a social media post.
Iran’s state media said the talks would be led by Araghchi and Trump’s special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, with the intermediation of Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi.
Iran had pushed back against Trump’s demands in recent weeks that it directly negotiate over its nuclear programme or be bombed, but it had recently left the door open to indirect discussions."

The US Supreme Court on Monday temporarily halted a judge’s order requiring US President Donald Trump’s administration to return by the end of the day a Salvadoran man who the government has acknowledged was deported in error to El Salvador.
Chief Justice John Roberts, acting on behalf of the court, paused an order by US District Judge Paula Xinis that the administration return Kilmar Abrego Garcia by the end of Monday, in response to a lawsuit filed by the man and his family challenging the legality of his deportation.
The court’s action, called an administrative stay, gives the justices additional time to consider the administration’s more formal request to block the judge’s order while litigation in the case continues.
Earlier on Monday, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals denied the administration’s request to freeze the judge’s order.
Xinis found that the US government had no lawful authority to detain and deport Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant who lived in Maryland legally with a work permit, and ordered his return by 11.59pm on Monday. He was deported on March 15 on one of three high-profile deportation flights to El Salvador that also included alleged Venezuelan gang members.
The Justice Department in its Supreme Court filing stated that while Abrego Garcia was removed to El Salvador through “administrative error”, his actual removal from the United States “was not error”."

Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to comment publicly.

Also affected are programmes supporting vulnerable Lebanese people and providing irrigation systems inside Syria, a country emerging from a brutal civil war and struggling with poverty and hunger.

At talks designed to chart a path forward between the two superpowers on Monday, ministers from EU member states urged action to protect businesses from Chinese industrial overcapacity, amid fears that their economies could be pummelled on two fronts.
The direct impact of Trump’s tariffs on EU shipments to the US will affect 70 per cent of its exports, worth some €370 billion (US$405 billion), when all of them are deployed.
The officials are also bracing for the possibility of an indirect consequence of Trump’s actions: Chinese goods that would have been bound for the US getting diverted to Europe at discounted prices, putting more pressure on local firms that are already under strain.
“We need to rebalance trade relations between the EU and China in line with our industry, our economic security and low carbon agendas,” Laurent Saint-Martin, France’s trade minister, said at Monday’s foreign affairs council.
“At the same time, we need to push our very assertive trade policy with them, especially fighting against overcapacity, especially during this very specific trade war time.”"

“I direct the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States … to conduct a review of the acquisition of US Steel by [Nippon Steel] to assist me in determining whether further action in this matter may be appropriate,” the memo reads.
The Trump administration, US Steel and Nippon Steel asked an appeal court later on Monday to pause their litigation until June 5 while the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States reviews the tie-up anew.
Following the block, the two companies sued CFIUS, which scrutinises foreign investments for national security risks, alleging that Biden prejudiced the committee’s decision and violated the companies’ right to a fair review.
They claimed that Biden did so to win the favour of the United Steelworkers union in the swing state of Pennsylvania, where US Steel is headquartered, to improve his chances of re-election."

Lawmakers have questioned the need to create three more positions in the office of Hong Kong’s leader amid the budget deficit, but an official has stressed the roles will support a “new culture” of better informing the public about policies.
The planned recruitment involved two information officers and a driver, who will cost taxpayers HK$2.66 million (US$342,000) annually in total.
The budget for the Chief Executive’s Office reached HK$130 million this year, after increasing by 7.8 per cent, or HK$9.2 million, over the previous year, surpassing the average spending hike of other government departments.
“Is [the hire] in line with the financial secretary’s call for everyone to endure the difficult time together?” lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said during a Legislative Council finance committee meeting on Monday.
“Shouldn’t the Chief Executive’s Office set an example? Which department doesn’t have more work to do? ... They all reduced manpower.”
Tik was referring to finance chief Paul Chan Mo-po’s budget address delivered in February, in which the minister said 10,000 civil service jobs would be axed by 2027 and the government would cut spending by 7 per cent over the coming three years to help reduce the HK$87.2 billion deficit.
But Kevin Choi, permanent secretary from the Chief Executive’s Office, sought to justify the new positions by noting the operation was relatively small with about 100 staff members."

Peter Navarro, US President Donald Trump’s top trade adviser, on Monday dismissed tech-billionaire Elon Musk’s push for “zero tariffs” between the United States and Europe, calling the Tesla CEO a “car assembler” reliant on parts from other countries.
Navarro, widely seen as the architect of Trump’s tariff plans, told CNBC Musk had done a good job with his work to streamline government, but his comments on tariffs were not surprising given his role as “car person”, the latest salvo in a growing feud between the Trump advisers.
“When it comes to tariffs and trade, we all understand in the White House – and the American people understand – that Elon is a car manufacturer, but he is not a car manufacturer. He is a car assembler,” Navarro said, adding that many Tesla parts came from Japan, mainland China and Taiwan.
“He is a car person. That’s what he does, and he wants the cheap foreign parts.”
Musk, speaking by video link at a Congress of Italy’s right-wing, co-ruling League Party just days after Trump announced hefty reciprocal tariffs against nearly 60 countries, said he hoped Europe and the US agreed to “a zero tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone”.
Trump’s plans call for European Union countries to face a general tariff of 20 per cent."

Stock markets rise and fall, but there are days when the plunge defies gravity. The Hang Seng Index slumped 13.2 per cent on Monday, its worst drop in percentage terms since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. However, some brokers are bullish the market will soon find a bottom and rebound as it has done so many times in the past.
The Hang Seng Index sank 13.2 per cent to 19,828.30, but the decline was far worse than those seen in other Asian markets, which slumped between 4 and 8 per cent.
While the decline wiped off the benchmark’s near 15 per cent gain in the first quarter, the gauge has lost more than 20 per cent from a recent peak, dragging it into a technical bear market.
The fall came after China on Friday imposed a tit-for-tat 34 per cent tariff on US goods following US President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” package on Tuesday against all its trading partners, including exports from Hong Kong and China to the US.
“There was pent up selling pressure after a public holiday on Friday in Hong Kong and mainland China,” said lawmaker Robert Lee Wai-wang, who is also the chairman of Hong Kong-based Grand Finance Group.
Despite the sell-off, Lee said the market was more capable of handling the slump than in previous crashes, like the one in 1987."

A group of couriers said they would file claims against Deliveroo after the food delivery platform failed to give them any compensation as the company exited the Hong Kong market on Monday.
The Riders’ Rights Concern Group said the 16 couriers were among an estimated 12,000 riders who were not given any employee entitlements by Deliveroo, as they were considered self-employed workers.
London-based Deliveroo announced it was closing down in Hong Kong after a nine-year run, with certain assets to be sold to rival Foodpanda.
The platform said in the announcement it had appointed two liquidators and pledged to offer employees an enhanced redundancy payment going beyond statutory requirements.
But the riders’ group said only 200 workers formerly employed by Deliveroo were entitled to the compensation.
“For such a large-scale platform, to our surprise, it did not mention a word about how to handle all of its couriers and only told them to go to Foodpanda, bye-bye,” programme officer Justine Lam said.
About 25 workers had sought help from the group since last month, Lam said. Among them, 16 had filed complaints to the Labour Department and planned to file claims against Deliveroo at the Labour Tribunal next week."

US President Donald Trump warned China on Monday that its imports would face an additional 50 per cent tariff – raising the total levy to more than 100 per cent – unless it lifts the retaliatory levies it imposed on American goods in response to the Trump administration’s heavy new duties last week.
“If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th. Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated,” he threatened in a post on his Truth Social account.
Trump has stood firm on the steep “reciprocal” tariffs he imposed on all imports entering the US, set to take effect on Wednesday, including a 34 per cent duty on Chinese goods. In response, Beijing imposed its own 34 per cent tariffs on US products.
He lashed out at China for striking back, accusing Beijing of imposing additional tariffs “on top of their already record setting Tariffs, Non-Monetary Tariffs, Illegal Subsidization of companies, and massive long term Currency Manipulation” despite his warnings against such actions.
Shortly after taking office in January, Trump imposed a 20 per cent additional tariff on Chinese imports, ostensibly for failing to do enough to combat the illegal flow of illicit drugs into the US. Following last week’s 34 per cent tariff increase, the total now stands at 54 per cent.
If the new 50 per cent tariffs are imposed on Wednesday, Chinese imports to the US would face a combined duty of 104 per cent."

“A new trade war does not come as a big surprise to China,” said Larry Hu, chief China economist at investment bank Macquarie, adding that China’s swift retaliation, rather than de-escalation, pointed to both Beijing’s preparedness and the likelihood that it does not intend to be rushed into negotiations with Washington.
“China’s door to negotiations is not closed,” Hu assessed. “But, on the other hand, it will also focus on expanding domestic demand to offset the trade war’s influence on external demand.”"

US stocks are swinging on Monday following a manic morning where indexes plunged, soared, and then sank again as Wall Street tossed around a false rumour about US President Donald Trump’s plans for his trade war.
Some investors are holding on to hope that Trump may still lower his tariffs after negotiating with other countries, and Trump said on Sunday that he has heard from leaders “dying to make a deal”.
Countries are scrambling to figure out how to respond to the tariffs, with China and others retaliating quickly.
Trump’s tariff blitz fulfilled a major campaign promise as he acted without Congress to redraw the rules of the international trading system. It was a move decades in the making for Trump, who has long denounced foreign trade deals as unfair to the US.
The higher rates are set to be collected beginning on Wednesday, ushering in a new era of economic uncertainty with no clear end in sight.

A prominent international relations scholar warned that war between China and the United States, while not inevitable, was probable, but their interdependence in areas such as the economy and climate could help them avoid conflict.
“War between US and China, inevitable? No. Likely? Yes,” said Graham Allison, the founding dean of Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. Allison, who served as assistant secretary of defence under former US president Bill Clinton, made the comments on Sunday at the Harvard College China Forum.
Allison’s speech came after US President Donald Trump imposed an additional 34 per cent tariff on China last week, which provoked a tit-for-tat response from Beijing.
This latest round of duties – the third since Trump returned to the White House in January – has raised the total tariff rate on Chinese goods to 54 per cent."

Chairman of Hong Kong property developer Sino Group Robert Ng Chee Siong and his three children have been designated as politically significant persons in Singapore under the city state’s foreign interference laws for their links to China’s top political advisory body.
Singapore’s home affairs ministry said in a statement on Monday that Ng, Daryl Ng Win Kong, Nikki Ng Mien Hua and David Ng Win Loong had made declarations last year to the Registry of Foreign and Political Disclosures that they were members of a foreign legislature or foreign political organisation. The declaration is required for Singapore citizens under foreign interference laws.

The ministry did not explicitly state which foreign country the four had links to, however they have all reportedly held positions in the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China’s top political advisory body.

Yangtze Memory Technologies Co (YMTC), China’s leading flash memory chipmaker, has published nearly 20 new patents for processes that can boost computing efficiency and optimise chip-stacking structures, in a show of technological prowess, according to records from the country’s intellectual property agency.
YMTC is known for its design and fabrication of 3D NAND, a flash memory in which transistor dies are stacked vertically to increase storage density. Patent applications made public in late March include an improved stacking structure to resist potential deformation, a way to shield from electromagnetic interference, and a method to boost storage density, according to records posted on the website of the China National Intellectual Property Administration.
Several of the innovations involve software optimisation. For example, one patent titled “a memory system and a method of operating the memory system” innovates the way a flash memory refreshes data, thus “reducing the frequency of erasing the memory device, delaying the wear-out failure of the memory device and, to some extent, expanding the service life of the memory system”, according to the application.
The patents, applied for between 2021 and 2023, were all “published” on March 28.
You Yunting, a senior partner at Shanghai Debund Law Firm, said that the patent examination would take about a year in the best case. “Three years is also normal. In more complex cases, four or five years is possible,” You said.

Hong Kong’s home and youth affairs minister has defended six district councillors who did not speak at any of last year’s meetings, saying that repeating views expressed by others would be “meaningless”.
Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak Mei-kuen insisted that all district councillors achieved their goals set by authorities, and believed they had prepared adequately for every meeting.
“If [a councillor] raised their hands or pressed the button slower than their neighbour, with their point expressed by their neighbour, the options left would be to repeat what has [already] been said, or say that [their] opinion was the same. That would be meaningless,” Mak said on Monday.
The minister was responding to a report by local media that six district councillors, all appointed or ex officio members, had no record of speaking at last year’s meetings. Another 33 did not speak in more than 80 per cent of meetings.
Mak added that unless residents wished to see eight- to nine-hour meetings with filibustering, “speaking for the sake of speaking” would be an ineffective use of time for councillors.
“This is definitely not how a meeting should work, speaking for the sake of speaking or speaking for the sake of [hitting] numbers. That’s not what we want to see,” Mak said.
Under a revamped electoral system to “depoliticise” Hong Kong’s municipal-level district councils after a landslide opposition victory in 2019, the city saw 470 new members take up office in December 2023."

For anybody who has struggled to pull together a grocery list or plan a week of family meals, the promise of assistance from artificial intelligence is downright appetising.
AI can make dull, time-consuming tasks a breeze, and nutrition experts who understand the emerging technology are enthusiastic. But they season their enthusiasm with more than a dash of caution.
“These tools are really good at giving you what you ask for, as long as you know what you’re asking for,” said Raul Palacios, director of the Didactic Programme in Dietetics at Texas Tech University in the United States.
Palacios is a registered dietitian nutritionist who teaches about AI and regularly uses AI interfaces, called chatbots, for all kinds of tasks. Professionally, AI has streamlined his work with meal plans.
At home, he has taken pictures of what is in his pantry and refrigerator, uploaded them and asked, “Based on the ingredients I have on hand right now, what can I make for a family of four?”"

The Kremlin said on Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin still supported the idea of a truce in Ukraine, but many unanswered questions remained about how it would work.
US President Donald Trump has been pushing for a speedy ceasefire between Moscow and Kyiv since taking office, but his administration has failed to make a breakthrough despite talks with both sides.
“Putin does support the idea that a ceasefire is needed, but before that a whole range of questions have to be answered,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday.
“These questions are hanging in the air, so far no one has given an answer to them,” he added, blaming the lack of progress on “the Kyiv regime’s uncontrollability”.
Putin has said that any peace agreement must address what Moscow sees as the causes of the conflict: essentially a tug of war between Russia and the West over Ukraine’s future and the post-Soviet enlargement of Nato towards Russia’s borders.
Putin has said the ceasefire would have to ensure that Ukraine did not simply use it to regroup, and that key questions about verification of a truce would need to be clarified."

Lawmakers have urged Hong Kong’s stock market operator to quicken its listing reform and other programmes as a way to enhance its market competitiveness and cope with market upheavals induced by a new round of global trade war.
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) should implement changes to its listing rules and other improvement plans as soon as possible, lawmakers said in a monthly financial affairs panel at the Legislative Council on Monday, against the backdrop of a global market sell-off.
“The volatile global markets may provide new opportunities for the Hong Kong IPO [initial public offering] market,” said Jeffrey Lam Kin-fung, a member of the city’s Executive Council. “HKEX should speed up the listing approval process and carry out more listing reforms to attract more new listings from leading companies of different markets.”
The Hang Seng Index sank 13 per cent to 19,828 on Monday in the worst rout since October 1997. Other Asian markets slumped by 4 per cent to 8 per cent. Markets crashed after China imposed a tit-for-tat 34 per cent tariff on US goods, following President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” package against all its trading partners.

“The Hong Kong stock market has been very volatile, while we also found the initial public offerings were robust in the first quarter,” Lam said. “Leading companies on the mainland and some overseas companies may consider listing in Hong Kong as the city’s market performance is more stable.”
Joseph Chan Ho-lim, Undersecretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, said the Hong Kong market was trading smoothly despite the volatility. The HKEX reforms have the backing of the government, he added."

By Kwon Mee-yoo
A golden seal, believed to date back to Korea’s ancient Goguryeo kingdom (37BC-AD668), fetched an astounding HK$10.8 million (US$1.39 million) at a major Hong Kong auction. This amount surpassed its presale estimate by more than nine times, setting a record for the price of ancient seals.
The golden seal with a horse-shaped knob was auctioned at China Guardian’s Hong Kong 2025 spring sale, titled Important Private Asian Collection of Ancient Seals and Bronzes, on April 6.
Initially, its estimated price ranged between US$153,800 and US$282,100, yet it ultimately garnered a much higher final bid.
The relic, standing 2.8cm tall and weighing just 88 grams, bears a Chinese inscription that reads, “Marquis of Guiyi of Goguryeo, conferred by the Jin dynasty”.
According to Park Dae-jae, a professor of Korean history at Korea University, this wording indicates that the Jin dynasty of China probably used the bestowal of official seals as a diplomatic strategy to win over or solidify ties with neighbouring states such as Goguryeo, offering insight into the political and diplomatic dynamics of early East Asia."

Singer Park Ki-young recently made headlines for revealing her second divorce – years after it happened. She first married a lawyer in 2010 but divorced in 2015. In 2017, she married a tango dancer and choreographer she met on KBS2’s Immortal Songs, but the couple separated in 2022. The news was only shared three years later.
Lee Won-seok, lead vocalist of Daybreak, also delayed his announcement. He married a non-celebrity in 2011 but divorced in 2021. It wasn’t until April 2023 that he posted the news on his blog, “In 2021, I experienced two major goodbyes and found myself alone again.”
Former MBC presenter Son Jung-eun disclosed her divorce on KBS Joy’s Ask Us Anything Fortune Teller in January. She said, “There were big changes in my life. My father passed away six years ago, and being an only child, it was very difficult. The following year, I separated from my husband.” She had previously announced her marriage to a businessman in 2011.
Public attitudes toward divorce have significantly shifted. Celebrities who are divorcees now speak more openly about their experiences on television. Actor Hwang Jung-eum addressed her divorce on SBS Plus and E Channel’s dating reality show Because I’m Solo. SBS’s Dolsing Fourmen centres on divorced male celebrities like Lee Sang-min and Lim Won-hee. MBN’s Love After Divorce featured broadcaster Park Chang-hyun and Redsox member Noh Jung-myung, garnering attention.
Divorce is no longer seen as a major blemish for stars. After Son’s appearance on Ask Us Anything Fortune Teller, public support poured in. Television personality Seo Jang-hoon said, “Most people didn’t know she had divorced, so she received more messages after the show than she did when she became an anchor.”"

Looking for drinking partners or just want to be left alone? In Noge, a Japanese neighbourhood in Yokohama with more than 600 bars and pubs, you can don a wristband and indicate your mood without having to say a word.
Called Tonight’s Wristband, or Konya no Wristband in Japanese, they were developed by a sake-loving American expatriate woman living in Yokohama, Tokyo-based news site Sora News24 reported.
Each band is written in both English and Japanese, and declares what sort of mood the drinker is in.
There are six in total, colour-coded like traffic lights.
The two declarations on the green bands are “Just looking to have a fun chat about anything today!” and “Care to join me for a cheers?”.
The yellow bands, which focus on conversational topics, are especially suited for those new in town or to the bar. They let staff or regulars know the wearers are looking for recommendations on what to see and drink in Yokohama.
Finally, the red bands act as non-verbal do-not-disturb signs. They read, “Just having a quiet night tonight” and “Just enjoying a drink” but, in typical Japanese manner, end with a polite “Thanks!”."

China’s top think tank has shut down its public policy research centre amid a new round of ideological reinforcement, with any activities carried out in its name declared “illegal”, with immediate effect.
Part-time researchers affiliated with other departments were returning to their original institutions while the remainder had been dismissed, according to the statement on the CASS website. The centre’s social media accounts and website have also been shut down.
“All activities carried out in the name of the former research centre are illegal and legal responsibility lies with the perpetrators,” said the statement, signed by the Institute of Economics, which is a CASS entity.
The now-defunct centre was once headed by economist Zhu Hengpeng, who was also deputy director of the Institute of Economics. He was last seen in public at the end of April 2024.
Sources familiar with the matter said that Zhu had been investigated and removed from his post in May for criticising China’s economic policies in a group discussion on WeChat.
CASS, once home to many liberal academics who were vocal in their criticism of the authorities, is undergoing a major shift towards greater loyalty to the ruling Communist Party."

A hot favourite to add a Hong Kong record 11th Group One success to his glittering CV, Romantic Warrior had the measure of Japan’s Soul Rush everywhere but the finish line in an epic contest decided by the tightest of photo finishes.
“The horse has pulled up fine. He is healthy. He will come back to Hong Kong and have a rest. It’s been a long trip for him and we think he is a bit tired,” said Ben So Tik-hung, assistant trainer to Shum.
After completing quarantine in Dubai, Romantic Warrior will return to Hong Kong later this month to recover from his arduous campaign in the Middle East.
His next race is likely to come in November’s Group Two Jockey Club Cup (2,000m).
While the world’s highest-earning racehorse will have to wait for his 11th Group One success, his exploits in the Middle East have done more for his reputation than anything he could have achieved at home in the past few months.
A sparkling winner of the Group One Jebel Hatta (1,800m) at Meydan in January, Romantic Warrior had to settle for second to Forever Young in a Group One Saudi Cup (1,800m) battle that seemed to prove telling for both gallopers come Dubai World Cup night.
Feted by Hong Kong fans, Romantic Warrior has an ever-growing profile abroad and jockey Cristian Demuro spoke glowingly of Shum’s charge after getting his measure aboard Soul Rush.
“It’s as good a performance as he’s ever produced, he beat the best horse in the world today,” said Demuro.
“It is a special win because we are now part of the Romantic Warrior story. He doesn’t lose many races, but today he found a good horse.”
Now boasting a record of 18 wins and five seconds from 25 starts, Romantic Warrior’s second in the US$5 million (HK$39 million) Dubai Turf pushed his career earnings to HK$214,709,697.
Romantic Warrior’s next big target will be securing a record-extending fourth consecutive victory in December’s Group One Hong Kong Cup (2,000m), while there has already been chat that Shum and owner Peter Lau Pak-fai could give their champion another chance to master the Riyadh dirt in next year’s Saudi Cup."

A key Apple subcontractor in China said the Trump administration’s new tariffs are unlikely to affect its business thanks to ongoing efforts to diversify its customer base and manufacturing operations.
Luxshare Precision Industry said it has been pre-empting geopolitical risks by integrating risk control into its strategic decision-making process, according to a report by state-backed media outlet Shanghai Securities News. The Shenzhen-based company added that it has expanded its client portfolio and diversified production locations, while pursuing independent innovation in core technologies.
In addition, Luxshare said tariffs are usually paid by importers under normal free on board (FOB) shipping arrangements. In international commercial law, FOB specifies at what point respective obligations, costs and risk involved in the delivery of goods shift from the seller to the buyer under the Incoterms standard published by the International Chamber of Commerce.
Luxshare is a significant contract manufacturer in Apple’s supply chain, assembling a wide range of its key products including AirPods, iPhones and the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset.
The company’s assessment comes after US President Donald Trump slapped an additional 34 per cent tariff on China, triggering a trade war that threatens to upend the global supply chain including Apple’s supplier network.
Luxshare’s Shenzhen-listed shares fell more than 10 per cent to 31.88 yuan (US$4.38) on Monday, its lowest point year to date, following a 10 per cent drop on Friday."

Hong Kong Ballet’s latest production, Frida, explores the life and art of Mexican painter Frida Kahlo.
The full-length work by choreographer Annabelle Lopez Ochoa was developed from a one-act ballet, Broken Wings, which she created for the English National Ballet in 2019, and the retitled two-act version for the Dutch National Ballet followed in 2020.
Frida is not a narrative ballet as such. Instead, Lopez Ochoa offers a series of snapshots of key moments from Kahlo’s life, interspersed with interludes featuring characters from her paintings. This kaleidoscopic concept would have worked as a one-act ballet, but a 90-minute production needs more clarity and structure to keep the audience engaged.
This is a powerful production visually, full of striking, flamboyant images and there is some good choreography – the first duet for Kahlo and Rivera is outstanding; the scene where she miscarries, her body twisting into terrible contorted poses, is gruesomely dramatic.
However, while Kahlo’s admirers will enjoy the references to her paintings, their symbolism and the way Dieuweke van Reij’s ingenious costume designs bring them to life, those not familiar with the paintings are likely to be left bemused.
Kahlo channelled her suffering – physical and emotional – into her art. She had a limp from childhood polio, and horrific injuries from a traffic accident when she was 18 left her struggling with pain and disability for the rest of her life."

A consortium of Chinese companies will provide 40 per cent of the funding for the US$5.3 billion, 475km (295-mile) railway line from Naivasha, a town in the Central Rift Valley, to Malaba. They will operate the railway and charge toll fees for some years to recoup their investment, according to Kenya’s finance minister John Mbadi.
How long the unnamed consortium will operate the railway is subject to negotiation.

Some 30 per cent of the project funding was expected to come from the Export-Import Bank of China (China Exim Bank) in the form of loans, Mbadi told Kenya’s National Assembly in response to questions from parliamentarians.
The Chinese policy bank funded the 590km (367-mile) first phase but the construction ended abruptly in Naivasha after it pulled the plug on financing the extension to Malaba after calling for a new commercial viability study in 2019.
The minister said the new funding strategy involved negotiating a loan deal with China that included a grace period until after 2029, when the country is expected to have paid more than 80 per cent of the loan for the current SGR.
The remaining 30 per cent of the construction cost will be financed by the Kenyan government, mostly from the railways development levy or securitisation of the levy, according to Mbadi."

The discovery of a second headless carcass belonging to an endangered pygmy elephant in the forests of Malaysia’s Sabah has raised alarm over a resurgence of ivory poaching, with conservationists linking the killings to tusk dowries in neighbouring Indonesia.
Wildlife smuggling in Malaysia continues to thrive despite sporadic crackdowns, with trafficking networks exploiting remote border regions like Sabah – as well as major transit points like the Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
Sabah Wildlife Department discovered the decapitated carcass last week in the Tibow rainforest, deep in the state’s interior – the second since January in the same area.
There are believed to be only around 1,000 pygmy elephants left in the wild, as deforestation and poaching have decimated their numbers.
Sabah’s tourism, culture and environment minister, Christina Liew, said roadblocks had been set up in a bid to catch the poachers.
“The ministry views the latest discovery of the headless carcass of a Bornean pygmy elephant seriously, especially since it is the second such incident in a short period of time,” Liew said on Monday."

Myanmar’s junta leader Min Aung Hlaing has made a belated visit to the earthquake epicentre of Sagaing, a city levelled by the disaster and where aid workers say relief supplies have been blocked and delayed by security forces in an area of resistance to military rule.
The junta chief visited Sagaing on Sunday – his first reported trip in 10 days since the March 28 quake, according to state mouthpiece Global New Light of Myanmar.
His visit, reported on Monday, comes as the official death toll across the country topped 3,500 with nearly 5,000 injured and 210 missing – numbers almost certain to spike.
Min Aung Hlaing has faced heavy criticism for leaving Myanmar in the middle of a humanitarian crisis last week to attend a regional summit in Bangkok.
Up to 80 per cent of Sagaing has been obliterated by the 7.7-magnitude quake that was followed by a 6.4 tremor.
Myanmar’s military has a long history of denying aid to its enemies during natural disasters or conflict, prompting the UN to join local rights groups to warn against any selective provision of relief."

China’s reliance on Latin America, particularly Chile and Peru, for copper ore is becoming increasingly precarious. Decades of intense mining in Chile have led to declining ore grades and rising extraction costs. In Peru, delays in obtaining permits and political instability further complicate operations.
Adding to the complexity, both nations have long-standing trade agreements with the United States – since 2004 for Chile and 2009 for Peru – exposing China to additional risks as US-China tensions harden.
A looming global copper deficit adds pressure. In 2020, China consumed 14.43 million tonnes of refined copper, 75 per cent of it imported. By mid-2024, it had stockpiled over 300,000 tonnes of copper in state reserves, anticipating future disruptions. But stockpiling is only a temporary fix. For long-term security, China needs stable, politically independent suppliers.
African countries, with their vast reserves, are becoming central to China’s new copper strategy. Currently, only 8 per cent of African mining output is under Chinese control, but key footholds have already been established through a mix of state-owned and private enterprises."

When most people think of dangerous infections, they picture bacteria or viruses. But for infectious disease specialists like Peter Chin-Hong, one of the most insidious threats lurking in hospitals and clinics today is fungal.
Chin-Hong’s case list is long: a healthy 29-year-old marathon runner from California’s Central Valley whose heart lining was invaded by coccidioides, a soil-dwelling fungus; a lung-transplant recipient coughing up mould nodules – fungal growths scattered throughout his lungs – after stopping antifungal medication; and a 45-year-old woman with poorly controlled diabetes, infected by a black fungus that destroyed part of her face and spread to her brain. Despite multiple operations and treatment, she died in hospital.
“These aren’t rare any more,” said Chin-Hong, associate dean and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. “We’re seeing them every day.”
Once considered obscure or opportunistic, invasive fungal infections are now surfacing with alarming frequency – and in patients and places doctors never used to worry about.
Climate change is expanding the geographic reach of fungi. Medical advances like organ transplants, chemotherapy, and intensive care are saving lives, but they also leave more patients immunocompromised."

“If I had stayed on the fence he probably would have nearly won it. With that weight he should be competitive in Class Three. He wasn’t beaten far last start and he showed that he can be competitive in the grade.”
Also among Atzeni’s book are last-start winner Same To You, who rises in grade for the third section of the Class Four King’s Park Handicap (1,200m), and Club Ace in the second section of the King’s Park Handicap.
“Same To You is a nice ride to get. He’s a course and distance winner and although he’s got a tricky draw, he won quite nicely the last day so hopefully up in class with a light weight shouldn’t be an issue,” said Atzeni of Mark Newnham’s charge, who carries 120 pounds from gate 12.

China has called on the nation to “weather storms together” amid an escalating trade war with the “capricious” Trump administration after the US president warned that Beijing had miscalculated in striking back at his new tariffs.
The editorial said the country would “resolutely” focus on its domestic situation in a bid to turn challenges from the White House’s tariff measures into a strategic opportunity. It also pointed to a battery of potential policy tools that could be used to mitigate shock waves on the world’s No 2 economy from heightened trade tensions with the United States.
The Chinese authorities announced a series of countermeasures on Friday, notably tit-for-tat additional 34 per cent tariffs on all imported American goods, in retaliation for the latest US levies on Chinese products, which observers described as an “epic” response that exceeded expectations.
Chinese stocks dived on the first trading day since Beijing launched its counter-attack. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index closed more than 7.3 per cent lower on Monday, prompting the Chinese sovereign fund company Central Huijin Investment to ramp up efforts to stabilise the market."

Central Huijin Investment, a unit of China’s US$1.2 trillion sovereign wealth fund, bought exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Monday, intervening in the nation’s stock market that is reeling from the mayhem inflicted by reciprocal tariffs from the US.
The company is “firmly” positive on the outlook of China’s capital markets and fully acknowledges the allocation values of A shares, or the yuan-denominated stocks trading on China’s onshore exchanges, the statement said.
Huijin was not alone in diving into the market. China Chengtong Financial Holdings and Beijing Chengyang Investment, two units under the state asset management company, said they too have been buying ETFs, without divulging details.
The state buying was the first move by Beijing to mitigate the fallout from the US’ full-blown trade war, which has swept across the global markets amid fears of a recession for the global economy.

Chinese companies with the biggest exposure to the US slumped in Hong Kong, sending the market to its worst day in nearly 30 years, as President Donald Trump’s sweeping reciprocal tariff on all trading partners sent shock waves through the global financial markets.
The Hang Seng Index tumbled 13.2 per cent on Monday, a scale not seen since the Asian financial crisis in October 1997. BYD Electronic, which derived 69 per cent of its 2024 sales from overseas, plunged 22.4 per cent to HK$28.80. PC maker Lenovo, which relied on the US for 35 per cent of its 2024 revenue, slumped 23 per cent to HK$7.58.
Machine tool maker Techtronic slumped 10 per cent to HK$73.90 and biotech firm WuXi Biologics plummeted 26 per cent to HK$18.28. The US sales as a proportion of their total revenue were 76 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively, according to China Galaxy Securities International.
On the mainland, Apple supplier Luxshare Precision Industry tumbled by the 10 per cent daily limit.

The study also found that countries had different strategies for accepting aid from Beijing. Southeast Asian states with acute development needs and constrained access to development financing, such as Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, were found to be the most reliant on China.
The findings, released on March 26, came from the report “Hedging bets: Southeast Asia’s approach to China’s aid” by Lowy Institute’s analysts Alexandre Dayant and Grace Stanhope.
Meanwhile, lower-middle-income countries with more diverse foreign relations, such as the Philippines and Vietnam, were classified as “restrained” in accepting Chinese funds, while higher-income nations with moderate development needs, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, approached ties with China “the most opportunistically and politically”.
The study said the “new-found agency” of many Southeast Asian countries to calibrate development ties with China might be undermined if Western aid cuts – such as President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 90-day freeze on foreign aid provided by the US across the board – translated to a drastic reduction of development financing available in the region.
“Countries already reliant on Chinese development support will have even less room to explore diversifying their ties. Countries with restrained or opportunistic approaches to China will find it harder to maintain this precarious balancing act,” the study said."

Barefoot in the dust, their hands wrapped in thin fabric, a handful of athletes practised Moraingy, a traditional Madagascan martial art, ahead of a fight in Antananarivo stadium.
The competition in the capital of the Indian Ocean island was aimed at promoting the age-old combat sport. Moraingy dates back to the 17th century.
It originated on the west coast of Madagascar, where it was practised as training for war and as an initiation rite marking the passage to adulthood.
It spread as people migrated and is mainly practised today in the north and northwest of the country.
“Watch your guard!,” shouted coach Thierry Saidani, whose training centre at the northern tip of Madagascar has created several champions."

Despite Japan failing to take advantage of the Chinese sending a depleted line-up to a tournament in South Korea last week, Sun Yingsha, China’s best women’s table tennis player, has warned of the rising danger posed by the country’s closest rivals.
China last week sent essentially a second-string team – one without five of their top 10 men’s and women’s players – to the WTT Champions Incheon event last week.
While China had two men and three women – compared with one and three from Japan – in the quarter-finals at the INSPIRE Arena, they still managed to win both singles events.
And while China still enjoys a slight edge over Japan at the top of the women’s rankings – the two countries fill up nine of the top 10 spots – Sun was taking nothing for granted.
“For sure, in many more competitions, many more young Japanese players are coming up,” the world No 1 said. “Most of the top 10 players, other than the Chinese, are from Japan.
“They are playing much more internationally, and we have more chances to play against them or to watch them play."

Oil sank after Saudi Arabia slashed its flagship crude price by the most in more than two years and the escalating trade war spurred concerns about a global recession and weaker energy demand.
Brent fell by almost 4 per cent to US$63.01 a barrel, a four-year low, before paring losses, while West Texas Intermediate was near US$60. Saudi Aramco lowered Arab Light crude to its biggest buyers in Asia more than expected for May, moving just days after Opec+ announced a surprisingly large output hike.
“Markets are beginning the week still in the throes of panic,” said Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights in Singapore. “No one dares pick a bottom” and “stand in the way of the selling tsunami,” she said.
Market metrics signal conditions are loosening. The spread between Brent for this December and the same month in 2026 flipped to contango briefly, with the nearer contract priced below the longer-dated one. That is a bearish structure.
Oil slumped along with other industrial and agricultural commodities and global equities as the wave of tariffs, plus retaliation from China, torpedoed appetite for risk. Crude’s losses were exacerbated by the surprise move by the Opec+ alliance to increase production by more than had been expected, stoking concerns about a global surplus.
Reflecting the fast-souring mood, Goldman Sachs reduced its price forecasts for the second time in less than a week. The revised outlook has Brent for December at US$62 a barrel versus US$66 previously."

Investors poured into safe havens like the yen and Swiss franc on Monday and heavily sold the risk-sensitive Australian dollar as the market rout from US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs deepened and fears of a global recession grew.
Global markets were sent into a tailspin on Monday as Asian stocks and Wall Street futures plunged and investors wagered that the mounting risk of a deep economic downturn could lead to a cut in US interest rates as early as May.
The dollar fell 0.63 per cent against the yen to 145.92, after tumbling more than 1 per cent earlier in the session, as the US dollar extended its 2 per cent slide against the Japanese currency from last week.
“The big theme has been selling USD/JPY because it’s a good US recession proxy and it’s a good US yields proxy and US yields tanked,” said Brent Donnelly, president of market maker and analytics firm Spectra Markets.
The Swiss franc jumped more than 0.8 per cent to 0.8531 per dollar, building on its 2.3 per cent surge against the US currency last week.
Both the yen and the franc have emerged as significant winners in the aftermath of Trump’s latest tariff salvo as investors dump riskier assets and flock to safe havens in a move that has also seen gold and government bonds catch a bid."

South Korea’s ousted president Yoon Suk-yeol has continued to rally supporters from his official residence by issuing a string of combative messages, while officials deny a June 3 date reportedly set for a snap election to find his successor.
Citing an unnamed official, Yonhap News Agency on Monday revealed the tentative date and said it would be announced after a cabinet meeting held by acting president, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, whose office later clarified no date had been set.
According to the constitution, a snap presidential election must be held within 60 days if the post becomes vacant due to reasons such as impeachment.
Three days after the Constitutional Court removed Yoon from office, he remains holed up in his presidential home near the Han River. There is no word on when he will return to his private home – a luxurious property in affluent southern Seoul.
Yoon and his wife, Kim Keon-hee, were reportedly caught off guard by the verdict. Local media reported his security detail had prepared a welcome ceremony, anticipating his reinstatement, and Yoon himself had planned a visit to the national cemetery to mark the occasion.
Shortly after his removal was confirmed on Friday, Yoon issued a statement to supporters, apologising for failing to meet their expectations, but stopped short of accepting the court’s ruling."

The move came amid heightened trade tensions between China and the US, set off by President Donald Trump’s announcement of heavier-than-expected tariffs last week and a proportionate response from Beijing.
“Emerging market currencies are under pressure from US tariff shocks, and today’s fixing reflects that market pressure,” said Ding Shuang, chief Greater China economist at Standard Chartered.
“Such a mild depreciation does little to offset the current tariff hike,” Ding said, adding he expects the central bank to maintain its strategy until the next round of tariffs is announced.

Wang Haoyu, 23, appeared in West Kowloon Court on Monday charged with six counts of criminal offences. He had been hospitalised since the incident took place on March 31.
To determine if he was fit to plead, the prosecution asked the court to send the suspect to the Siu Lam Psychiatric Centre for further examination. Wang faces two counts of common assault, and one count each of theft, criminal damage, obstructing a police officer in due execution of duty and wounding.
The defendant, from mainland China, allegedly became agitated when a woman asked him to turn down the volume of a video playing on his phone at a campus canteen.
He was then said to have attacked her, as well as a canteen staff member who tried to stop him.
Wang also allegedly stole the woman’s belongings after she fled, including HK$970 (US$125) in cash, her ID card, bank cards and other personal items."

Air India long languished under government ownership while cash-rich Middle Eastern rivals siphoned off travellers. Now the airline is trying to even the score with cheaper fares, fresh cabins and lounges as well as shorter layover times.
The multi-year turnaround programme will initially focus on the airline’s 27 Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners that are more than 10 years old in some cases, with Air India seeking to complete a refit in early 2027. A second stage, involving older Boeing 777 wide-bodies, will start late next year, though that step is proving more complex because of issues with seat suppliers, according to Chief Executive Officer Campbell Wilson.
“Consistency makes an airline good,” Wilson said in an interview. “There should be a consistency in product quality, crew service, punctuality, and experience at airports and in aircraft. We are working on all of those.”

Live Nation said fans attending the shows would be allowed to have plastic or silicone reusable bottles, or cups inside, but they must be empty and have a maximum capacity of 600 millilitres (20.3 fluid ounces).
Kai Tak Sports Park on Monday clarified that these bottles must also come without lids.
Disposable plastic, glass or thermal bottles, as well as those bigger than 600ml, are prohibited.
During earlier events and trial runs, many people had to store their bottles on unstaffed racks placed outside the venue, while those who were unaware of the blanket ban held up the queues at security checks.

Once an illegal fisherman who would cut down the tropical trees to be sold as fuel, he now protects them as part of a civilian fisheries patrol force.
“Because life was difficult, we were forced to cut and sell mangroves back then. We couldn’t find other jobs,” Longos, 44, said.
Because of efforts by the local government to offer job training and nurture an ecotourism business, people like Longos became part of the solution, not the problem.
“I started planting new mangroves when I stopped doing illegal activities in 2011,” he said, proudly pointing out a mangrove he helped plant along the water.
For decades, the area’s mangrove cover was reduced by destructive fishing methods such as the use of dynamite and by illegal deforestation for wood to bake bread or make charcoal."

The firm said expatriates returned to the city from Singapore in the first quarter of the year, though there was minimal activity in the major luxury enclaves and the market remained subdued.
Leasing transactions occurred mainly in the lower rental brackets in Kowloon, it said, driven by an influx of talent from the mainland.
“In addition to mainland talent, expatriates and individuals from mainland China working in hedge funds and cryptocurrency have recently contributed to increased demand for leasing, each exhibiting distinct housing preferences,” said Jack Tong, the director of Savills Research & Consultancy.
Many of these renters have profited from cryptocurrency trading, the firm said, adding that they generally seek new flats in Kowloon with established surrounding mainland communities or opt for short-term accommodation.
In the fourth quarter, residential rents for luxury flats in Kowloon rose 3.9 per cent from the third period, compared with a decrease of 0.2 per cent in Hong Kong Island, according to Savills residential rental indices."

Hong Kong exporters will bear the brunt of United States President Donald Trump’s crackdown on duty-free entry for low-value packages shipped from the city and mainland China from May 2, economists and industry players have warned.
The White House claimed the removal of the so-called “de minimis” exemption, which applies to international shipments with a retail value of US$800 or less, was essential because it had been used by many e-commerce companies to avoid import taxes and customs inspections.
In response, the Hong Kong government said it would continue postal services to the country until May 2, but would not collect any tariffs on behalf of the US government.
The Post examines how this policy will affect Hong Kong businesses and the wider economy.
The name of the policy derives from the Latin phrase “de minimis non curat lex”, meaning “the law does not concern itself with trifles”, with the provision originally designed to reduce administrative burdens.
The trade provision allows companies to avoid US import duties by shipping products directly to individual consumers in small parcels, usually via air cargo."

Hassett said this did not mean that Russia was being treated completely differently from other countries, and said Trump was merely focusing on talks with Russia to end the war against Ukraine.
In an initial explanation after the tariffs were announced, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that Russia had not been included because US sanctions already exclude any significant trade.

I was immediately hooked and have attended every year since, pandemics permitting.
Not surprisingly as it grew in popularity, the tournament outgrew the Football Club ground and moved to the old Government Stadium in So Kon Po. Even that proved insufficient after a few years and a new one had to be built in situ. Dragages designed and built a fine 40,000-seater. That did us proud for many years, but the world moved on and, eventually, so did we.

Hong Kong has hosted the Track Cycling World Cup three times – in 2016 and twice in 2019 – the Track Cycling Nations Cup in 2021 and 2024, as well as the UCI Track Cycling World Championships in 2017.

Corrected to specify the average account size that clients have with Goldman Sachs’ private wealth management division.
Goldman Sachs has begun providing advice on art and collectibles to ultra-wealthy people in Asia, including Hong Kong and mainland China, which together form the world’s second-largest art market.
The US investment bank’s private wealth management (PWM) division started its art and collectibles advisory service in the US in 2019, expanded to Europe three years ago and rolled out in Asia last year. The division has around 16,000 clients globally who put an average of US$70 million worth of assets with the bank. Ultra-high-net-worth individuals are defined as those with more than US$30 million in net worth.
“We serve many clients who transact in passion and luxury assets, and we want to help them think more strategically about the markets for these assets, which are sometimes not very transparent,” Monica Heslington, head of art advisory in Goldman’s PWM division, told the Post in an exclusive interview in Hong Kong.
“Art and collectibles have a higher degree of complexity, and people need the right experts to help them through the process.”
While clients in Asia and the West are similar in terms of their passion for art, the infrastructure surrounding the market differs across the two regions, according to Heslington.
In the US, many people rely on art advisers for negotiations, research and education, and they hire specialised lawyers to review contracts, she said."

Hong Kong’s new police chief hopes to instil a sense of duty into residents to encourage them to defend national security in their daily lives, saying the city cannot afford to experience more clashes such as those during the 2019 social unrest.
Commissioner of Police Joe Chow Yat-ming also said he was neither a “hawkish” hardliner nor a “dovish” moderate in terms of his policing style, adding that the force should be tough on crime but could be softer when reaching out to the public to explain its work.
“I’d rather the public think of me as someone diligent than a hawkish or dovish figure. As a biology graduate, I think hawks and doves are both great,” Chow said.
“Sometimes, you have to tell people what is right and what is wrong. Other times, you can adopt softer approaches to explain our work to residents, depending on the nature of the task.”
The police chief said national security extended beyond the city’s two national security laws and covered other areas, such as cybersecurity."

“By and large, we’re seeing generally somewhat pessimistic views from the survey respondents,” Ho said. “The overall sentiment is that we are living in a very volatile environment right now.”
The main concern behind the pessimistic sentiment is cybercrime, Ho said. Hong Kong is a fast-paced financial hub, which makes it a frequent transit point for global fraud, she added.
“That is almost a by-product of being a financial centre, but it also puts the pressure on financial institutions and banks in Hong Kong to be more stringent in terms of their [know your customer] procedures, anti-money-laundering protection mechanisms and procedures,” she said.

Trump has remained defiant since unleashing the blitz of tariffs on stunned nations around the world on Wednesday, insisting that his policies “will never change” even as markets went into a tailspin.
Futures contracts for the New York Stock Exchange’s main boards were sharply down on Sunday, suggesting more pain for battered Wall Street stocks when markets open on Monday, while US oil dropped below US$60 a barrel for the first time since April 2021.
A little over half an hour after the contracts resumed trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.56 per cent, while the broader S&P 500 index was down 3.85 per cent.
Trump said on Sunday the violent falls in US and global markets showed the “medicine” of his trade tariff barrage was working.
“Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One as he returned to Washington from a weekend of golfing in Florida, adding that trade partners were “coming to the table” and “want to talk”."

Music pumping from the DJ, families basking under the sun and spectators enjoying cold beers while the final of the ITF Beach Tennis World Tour Hong Kong unfolded gave Discovery Bay’s Tai Pak beach a new feel on Sunday.
It was the first time Hong Kong had hosted an ITF beach tennis tournament and hundreds of people were drawn to the event, which started on Friday.
Arnault Brac de la Perriere, unofficially the city’s leading player, was responsible for bringing the BT10- and BT50-level events to the city.
The Hong Kong resident hails from the Indian Ocean island of Reunion, where beach tennis is the national sport and home to the Sand Series Reunion Classic Tournament, a grand slam event.
Now, Brac de la Perriere has set his sights on giving the city its own grand slam, something he said was achievable in the next few years.
“The road map is quite clear,” he said. “We need at least two years of solid BT100, BT200 and potentially BT400 events.
“There are a lot of facilities that we need but I was part of the organisation of the grand slam in Reunion, so I know what we have to do.”"

Around 50km (30 miles) north of the city of Shaoguan, in northern Guangdong province, towering crimson cliffs rise above lush forests and winding streams, drawing young and old alike.
In the Danxia Shan national geopark tens of millions of years of erosion and tectonic activity have sculpted red sedimentary rock into dramatic peaks and valleys.

The Israeli military said that during “counterterrorism activity” in Turmus Ayya, “soldiers identified three terrorists who hurled rocks towards the highway, thus endangering civilians driving”.
“The soldiers opened fire toward the terrorists who were endangering civilians, eliminating one terrorist and hitting two additional terrorists,” a military statement added.
The Palestinian health ministry said one person was in critical condition and another suffered minor injuries in the same incident.
Shalabi said one of the wounded also had US citizenship. Turmus Ayya, north of the main West Bank city of Ramallah, is known for having many dual US-Palestinian citizens.

American actor John Lithgow won the best actor trophy at the London stage Olivier Awards on Sunday for exploring the dark side of children’s writer Roald Dahl in Giant.
Backwards-biographical story The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was named best new musical at the awards, Britain’s equivalent of Broadway’s Tony Awards.
Conclave star Lithgow added the Olivier to an awards shelf that already includes multiple Tony, Emmy and Golden Globe trophies, for depicting the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in Mark Rosenblatt’s play, which confronts Dahl’s antisemitic views.
“I think I’m going to faint,” said an emotional Lithgow, 79. He said he wanted to assure Britons that the transatlantic “special relationship is still firmly intact”.
“It’s not always easy to welcome an American into your midst, and at this particular moment, it’s probably a little more complicated than usual,” he said.
Lesley Manville, whose CV includes a stint as Princess Margaret in The Crown, took the best actress prize for her performance as shocked royal spouse Jocasta in Oedipus.

A US citizen awaiting trial in Moscow has been forcibly admitted to a psychiatric hospital, Russian state media reported on Sunday.
Joseph Tater, 46, was arrested in August 2024 after being accused of assaulting a police officer during a confrontation with staff at an upmarket hotel in the Russian capital.
A Moscow court agreed to admit Tater to a psychiatric hospital non-voluntarily after a medical evaluation on March 15, Russian state news agency Tass reported.
It said that doctors had described Tater as displaying signs of “tension, impulsivity, persecutory delusions, and lack of self-awareness regarding his condition”.
The US embassy in Moscow declined to comment on the case, citing privacy concerns.

It is unclear when the court made its decision to detain him on medical grounds, but Tass previously reported that he had been released from pre-trial detention at the end of March."

Chinese-born Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, who was born in Yemen – both Labour MPs – flew from London to Israel to visit the occupied West Bank but were blocked from entering Israel and deported back to the UK, British media reported.
“It is unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning that two British MPs on a parliamentary delegation to Israel have been detained and refused entry by the Israeli authorities,” Lammy said in a statement.
“I have made clear to my counterparts in the Israeli government that this is no way to treat British parliamentarians, and we have been in contact with both MPs tonight to offer our support.

North Korea on Sunday held its first Pyongyang International Marathon in six years, hosting foreign runners in the reclusive country that has largely closed its borders since the Covid-19 pandemic.
Athletes from China, Ethiopia and other countries took part in the event, according to state TV. The marathon is one of several events held to celebrate the April 15 birthday of Kim Il-sung, North Korea’s founder and grandfather of current leader, Kim Jong-un.
About 200 foreigners arrived on Friday and Saturday in Pyongyang where those running practised at a hotel for the Sunday race, said Simon Cockerell, general manager at Beijing-based Koryo Tours, in Instagram posts.
The Koryo Tours is an official partner of the Pyongyang Marathon, aiding the sign-up process for international competitors.
The isolated state sealed its borders in 2020 at the start of the pandemic but has been slowly lifting restrictions since 2023.
It has allowed Russian tourist groups into the country but its capital remains closed to regular tourism.
The marathon is a return course running through central Pyongyang, passing major landmarks and heading out into the countryside before coming back through the city to a stadium filled with 50,000 spectators, Koryo Tours said."

The Chinese defence ministry said the facility was designed to “strengthen practical military cooperation” – supporting regional counterterrorism, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.
The ministry added that it “does not target any third party” – an apparent reference to US concerns about potential exclusive PLA access to the site.
Brian Wong, a fellow at the Centre on Contemporary China and the World at the University of Hong Kong, said the facility reflected Beijing’s strategic efforts to diversify regional maritime access as part of its broader Belt and Road Initiative.
In particular, the base would improve access to the strategic Andaman Sea, bypassing chokepoints imposed by Vietnam, Singapore and Indonesia, he said."

Pope Francis made a surprise public appearance on Sunday as he mingled with crowds at the Vatican just two weeks after leaving hospital for a serious case of pneumonia.
“A good Sunday to all. Thank you very much”, the 88-year old pope said as he was wheeled through Saint Peter’s Square in his wheelchair after a mass dedicated to the sick.
Surrounded by a mass of smartphones and cameras, and attached to nasal breathing tubes, his voice was fragile but more audible than when he left the Gemelli hospital on March 23. The Argentine’s last public appearance was on February 14.
Francis is, in theory, undergoing two months of convalescence following his life-threatening health scare, with strict rest, no public activity and no contact with crowds.
Yet the Jesuit spent Sunday morning blessing the masses gathered on the sunny square, in an encouraging signal for his health two weeks before Christians the world over celebrate Easter.
“He’s doing better, that’s clear, and he wants that to be seen,” a Vatican source said on condition of anonymity.
“He’s not yet well enough to deliver a message, but well enough to make a gesture … and show up,” the source added."

While Sword Point resented the kickback when a distant last in the Group Two Godolphin Mile on the Meydan dirt on Saturday night, Lor’s spirits were lifted by Voyage Samurai and three-year-old Mr Cool’s impressive victories.
The small field and lack of speed in the Class Two Faculty Of Education Alumni Handicap (1,600m) set up perfectly for Voyage Samurai and it played out to script when he made all under Derek Leung Ka-chun.
Sent off the $1.6 favourite, the Dissident gelding dictated from the front and was never threatened when beating the $4.9 second elect, Helene Feeling, by a length and a quarter.
Top win, Voyage Samurai! Derek Leung steers Frankie Lor's ultra-consistent charge to a fifth career win at Sha Tin... 👏#LoveRacing | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/ET4fDZ9kmV
“Early in the season he was still good, but then in two or three races his form dropped a little bit,” Lor said after Voyage Samurai was a disappointing seventh and ninth in January.
“This time we put the blinkers on and he’s more focused. I hope he can keep improving and 1,800m I think is no problem for him.”
Voyage Samurai has built a superb record of five wins and as many seconds from his 13 career starts.
“Finally I got another win on him,” Leung said. “He’s been very honest this season and even before.
“He was just beaten last time by a better horse [Sunlight Power] and this time the field didn’t seem as strong. He controlled the pace and he didn’t mind the fast tempo – I’m happy.”
Mr Cool clinched Lor’s brace with an excellent triumph at start two, finishing powerfully under Karis Teetan to claim the Class Four Morningside Alumni Handicap (1,400m).
Sky Jewellery added another layer to his reputation as a galloper with a big future after storming home to win the Class Three Wu Yee Sun And Lee Woo Sing Alumni Handicap (1,600m).
With two wins and a close second from his first four starts, expectations were again high for the John Size-trained gelding when he started a raging $1.55 favourite in the final race on the card.
Impressive win, Sky Jewellery! 🌟

And he didn’t let backers or connections down, rocketing home from 11th on the turn to record another powerful victory under Hugh Bowman.
“He’s a nice horse. He’s still learning his trade though but he was aided by a really solidly run mile,” Bowman said after Sky Jewellery beat Morgan Success by two lengths.
“When he got in amongst horses – that was the first time he’s had that – he was a bit new to it but he had time to get himself together and understand what was going on.
“I had a clear passage when I needed to move and I had time to get him organised before I let him down and the response was there for everyone to see.”
Size completed a double in the final two races on Sunday’s card, with Brilliant Express chiming in to claim the Class Three S.H. Ho And CW Chu Alumni Handicap (1,400m).
Despite being trapped three wide without cover under Brenton Avdulla, Brilliant Express kept finding from midfield to beat Eighty Light Years by a neck in a tight finish.
The $1.8 favourite, The Boom Box, was beaten just under a length in third after zigzagging through the field under Zac Purton.
Size extended his lead in the trainers’ premiership, moving to 47 wins – seven clear of nearest rival David Hayes.
Brilliant Express helped clinch a double for Avdulla, who earlier won on the David Hall-trained Geneva in the Class Three Shaw Alumni Handicap (1,200m).
The long wait for a much-needed winner ended for Jerry Chau Chun-lok on Sunday, with the young jockey halting his drought of 74 rides with victory on Chateau Le Peche.
Winless since booting home Sky Joy on January 19, Chau returned to the winners’ enclosure in Sunday’s opener when he guided Jimmy Ting Koon-ho’s galloper to his maiden success at start 17.
After travelling smoothly in midfield, Chateau Le Peche kept finding to wear down Joyful Champion late to score by a short head.
The Embellish four-year-old had only managed three placings from his first 16 starts, but he thrived from a soft draw in gate two on his return to 2,000m in the Class Five Graduate School Alumni Handicap."

“I thought I had a few decent rides today and some of the draws went my way, too,” said Teetan, who moved to 30 wins for the campaign. “It’s turned out to be a great day.”
Top Throne started Teetan’s red-letter day with an impressive victory in the second section of the Class Four New Asia Alumni Handicap (1,200m).
Backed into $3 favouritism after a close fourth on debut, the David Hayes-trained gelding had a sweet run in the box seat from gate two and pounced on the lead 150m out when hooked out into the clear by Teetan.
The three-year-old responded strongly to salute by three-quarters of a length, holding off a late charge from Dazzling Fit with debut winner Mount Everest also running on late for third.
“He ran great in his first run,” Teetan said of Top Throne’s debut behind Mount Everest on March 9.
“He actually did many things wrong but to still run where he ran was a great effort and we thought he would always improve from that, which he did.”
Teetan followed up in the next race on David Eustace’s Good Luck Babe, leading all the way to salute in the Class Four United Alumni Handicap (1,600m).
Sporting a familiar set of silks on Mr Cool in the Class Four Morningside Alumni Handicap (1,400m), Teetan clinched his treble when the Frankie Lor Fu-chuen-trained gelding stormed home on his second start.
Mr Cool went two better than his debut third to Tactical Command when he ran on powerfully from the back half of the field to beat Etalon Or by three-quarters of a length.
“I said to the owner [Maurice Koo Win-chong] ‘this is one of my favourite set of silks’ in Hong Kong because of Mr Stunning,” Teetan said, referring to the Koo-owned galloper he booted home in a pair of Group Ones.
“On debut at Happy Valley, he just didn’t know where he was but he ran a great race and we knew he would improve a lot.
“You could see today, not many horses won from where he was but the speed was on and I was happy where I was.
“When I asked him he really responded well and I just want to say well done to the connections and well done to all the trainers sticking with me and giving me support – I really appreciate it.”"

Hong Kong’s triathletes have set themselves the objective of overtaking mainland China, after the city team claimed relay bronze at the Asia Sprint Championships on Sunday.
The dominant Chinese, whose team included Lin Xinyu and Yang Yifan, the women’s gold and silver medallists from Saturday’s individual race, crossed in one hour, 31 minutes and four seconds, after leading from the start on Central Harbourfront.
Their men, Fan Junjie and Zhang Xirui, had been third and fifth, respectively, the previous day.
The Hong Kong quartet of sisters Cade and Tallulah Wright, Robin Elg and Jason Ng Tai-long came home in 1:32.15, two seconds behind Japan, who left out individual men’s winner Takumi Hojo from their team.
A second Hong Kong foursome of Hilda Choi Yan-yin, Oscar Coggins, Charlotte Hall and Mark Yu Shing-him finished seventh in 1:34.24.
Tallulah Wright, who acknowledged the fierce inter-squad competition for National Games selection in November, said while Japan used to be the benchmark “China blew it out of the park, they were phenomenal”."

Chief Economic Minister Airlangga Hartarto said in a statement that Indonesia would pursue diplomacy and negotiations to find mutually beneficial solutions after Trump announced sweeping global tariffs on Wednesday.
“The approach was taken by considering the long-term interest of bilateral trade relation, as well as to maintain the investment climate and national economic stability,” Airlangga said, adding that Jakarta will support potentially impacted sectors, such as apparel and footwear industry.
Trump’s tariff on Indonesia, one of six hard-hit Southeast Asian countries, is set to take effect on Wednesday.
The Indonesian government will gather inputs from businesses on Monday to help formulate strategy to address the US tariffs, and will find ways to increase trade with European countries as an alternative to the US and China, Airlangga said.
Jakarta has said it would send a high-level delegation to the US for direct negotiations with the government."

Boasting several strong fancies among his team of eight, Eustace struck with Regency Happy Star and Good Luck Babe before one of his least-fancied runners pulled off a late plunge to cap the stable’s three-timer.
Sea Sapphire was brown-lamped late in betting in the Class Four The CUHK Alumni Cup (1,200m), firming from $28 to $13 before making all under Ben Thompson.
A prolific Group One winner in Australia in partnership with Ciaron Maher, Eustace has made an instant impression in Hong Kong with 23 wins in his first campaign.
Sea Sapphire caps a @EustaceRacing treble! 🔥 @BenThompson2102 collects the CUHK Alumni Cup at Sha Tin... #LoveRacing | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/rLOktk3cxK
“It’s very exciting,” Eustace said of his three-timer.
“I thought we were coming here with a strong team and probably our first three runners proved that, with two winners and a second [with Dazzling Fit].
“[Sea Sapphire] is a nice surprise. They’ve all raced well and consistently, so it’s very pleasing.”
Sent to the front from gate nine, Sea Sapphire kept finding to shrug off a determined challenge from the $3.2 favourite Akashvani.
He scored by a neck as the first two home broke well clear of their rivals, with third-placed Lucky Archangel beaten just over three lengths.
On his fourth run since switching from the Pierre Ng Pang-chi stable, Sea Sapphire bounced back from a disappointing last-start 12th at Happy Valley in January.
“To be honest, I thought he was coming into the race in good form,” Eustace said.
“His trial on the grass was very pleasing and a lot better than his trials on the dirt, where he doesn’t really show his best. We had a setback earlier in the season just through health and his run prior to his last one actually had a lot of merit.
“Obviously I thought he would improve with the run, but the race set up really well and he got a beautiful ride by Ben.
“He’s a horse who doesn’t need too much training, he doesn’t carry a huge amount of weight so it’s just a case of keeping him fresh and well and healthy, which he is.”
Thompson, who rode Sea Sapphire on his previous two starts before Sunday, wasn’t shocked by the gelding’s second career victory.
“It’s no surprise for him to beat a handy field. Especially Akashvani, who was there with us the entire way,” the Australian said.
“[Sea Sapphire] had 118 pounds, obviously for a very in-form stable, and he duly saluted.”
Another stable transfer, Regency Happy Star, notched his third win from six starts for Eustace with a thrilling triumph in the Class Five Chung Chi Alumni Handicap (1,400m).
Sent off the $2.5 favourite, Regency Happy Star had a cosy run on the leader’s back from gate one for Alexis Badel and prevailed by a short head from Lucky Man.
“He’s had a terrific season – he’s just gaining confidence and relaxing very well now in his races,” Eustace said of the former Michael Chang Chun-wai and Tony Cruz-trained galloper.
“It’s going to start to get a bit tougher, but hopefully we can have one more go in Class Five.”
Good Luck Babe was the middle leg of Eustace’s treble, leading all the way under Karis Teetan to beat Matsu Victor narrowly in the Class Four United Alumni Handicap (1,600m).
Eustace wasn’t far off winning four consecutive races on Sunday, with Dazzling Fit charging from near last to finish second to Top Throne in the second section of the Class Four New Asia Alumni Handicap (1,200m)."

Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau on Sunday likened the planned healthcare fee reform to “an additional health insurance package” for all Hongkongers, saying it aimed to enhance medical protection for the public.
In a televised interview, Lo said the Hospital Authority was working out details on charging patients no-show fees for services such as medical scans. One option under consideration was to ask for prepayment or a deposit.
“It is like when you book a hotel room. Some hotels will require a credit card to guarantee your reservation. And if you do not cancel your booking up to a certain number of days prior to the arrival date, then there will be a penalty or you only have a partial refund,” he said.
“If you simply do not show up, the booked service will be left unused, then you may be charged the full total of the cost.
“Everyone has to take responsibility for their actions … Many people are queuing for the service and it is very unsatisfactory if we allow no-shows to happen.”
The government last month announced it would raise public hospital fees, saying the move was partly aimed at narrowing the price differences between the public and private sectors, as well as cracking down on abuse of services."

Police in northwestern China are investigating whether a rare snow leopard found dead on Saturday was hit and killed by a motorist.
Municipal authorities in Golmud, a city on the Tibetan Plateau in Qinghai province, said the male leopard was found dead on a mountain highway on Saturday. Tyre marks bearing traces of blood were also found at the scene.
The local grasslands bureau said the police were “investigating and verifying” the cause of the accident.
It added: “If any illegal behaviour is found, it will be severely cracked down on in accordance with the law. In view of the frequent activities of wild animals in this area, we urge drivers and passengers to drive carefully and avoid wild animals crossing the road.”
A witness who reported the snow leopard’s death to police told Sichuan Radio and Television that there were seven to eight bloody footprints around its body.
Snow leopards are a protected species and there are around 5,000 of them living in the wild in China, according to state news agency Xinhua. Of these 1,200 – around a quarter of the total population – are in Qinghai.
Snow leopards are listed as a “vulnerable” animal on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species. The conservation group estimates that there are just 7,500 to 8,000 snow leopards remaining in the world."

Hong Kong is set to attract about 170,000 visitors on the back of at least 56 events the Tourism Board has helped to put on the city’s calendar this year in the meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) sector.
The board said it had submitted bids to bring the events to the city, with 16 to make their debut locally this year.
Among the full calendar of events are the International Society for Stem Cell Research’s annual meeting in June, as well as aviation conferences Routes World 2025 and Airspace Asia-Pacific 2025 in September and December, respectively.
The board’s director of MICE business development, Phoebe Shing, said the 56 events would attract about 170,000 mainland Chinese and overseas visitors, with around 260,000 people taking part.
“The Tourism Board will fully promote the development of MICE tourism, continue to strive for more large-scale events, consolidate Hong Kong’s position as an international MICE capital and attract high-end tourists to Hong Kong,” she said.
Total overnight MICE visitors to Hong Kong, including those who attended events not facilitated by the board, increased by about 10 per cent to 1.42 million last year over the figure for 2023."

Hong Kong jewellers will be forced to reduce their exposure to the US, scale back operations, relocate production or even close down, as American President Donald Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on Chinese exports raises levies to as much as 60 per cent, industry leaders have said.
The latest tariffs of 34 per cent on Chinese exports, effective on April 9, would double retail prices, fuel inflation, reduce sales of these goods to the US and potentially force some exporters out of business, industry figures told the Post.
They added that a 10 per cent blanket tariff on virtually all countries meant the jewellers’ workaround option of relocating production to Southeast Asian countries was no longer feasible.
“Many companies will choose to downsize or not to operate in the US market,” Bronia Yip Mei-chu, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Jewelry Manufacturers’ Association, said.
Yip said the tariff situation was particularly dire for small and medium-sized enterprises, which had limited manpower even though they might have an array of products and diverse markets, such as Europe, Southeast Asia and the Middle East.
“The only [solution] is to reduce the share of the US [exposure] and possibly increase the share of sales in other markets, Europe, and now more markets in the Belt and Road Initiative and some new Eastern European countries or Africa,” she said."

The Israeli military has provided new details that changed its initial account of the killing of 15 emergency workers near the southern Gaza city of Rafah last month but said investigators were still examining the evidence.
The 15 paramedics and emergency responders were shot dead on March 23 and buried in a shallow grave where their bodies were found a week later by officials from the United Nations and the Palestinian Red Crescent. Another man is still missing.
The military initially said soldiers had opened fire on vehicles that approached their position “suspiciously” in the dark without lights or markings. It said they killed nine militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad who were travelling in Palestinian Red Crescent vehicles.
But video recovered from the mobile phone of one of the dead men and published by the Palestinian Red Crescent showed emergency workers in their uniforms and clearly marked ambulances and fire trucks, with their lights on, being fired on by soldiers.
The only known survivor of the incident, Palestinian Red Crescent paramedic Munther Abed, also said he had seen soldiers opening fire on clearly marked emergency response vehicles.
An Israeli military official said late on Saturday the investigators were examining the video and conclusions were expected to be presented to army commanders on Sunday."

Scott, an artist himself, lent his visual talents to the project
When Ridley Scott, visionary director of Alien, Blade Runner and Gladiator, connects with your story, it’s probably a good idea to explore it in any medium possible.
Modville, a four-issue neo-noir graphic novel set in New Orleans in 2169 that unfolds in a world of crime and artificial humans, known as mods, was just that story.
Created by Jesse Negron, the comic touches on themes of father-daughter relationships, morality and humanity.
The comic series bucks the current trend of reframing superhero narratives. Instead, it is from an original idea and will go direct to consumers as opposed to being released by a big publisher.
Negron, who had previously worked with the director and his late brother, Tony Scott, pitched the idea of doing a comic book to Tom Moran, senior vice-president of Ridley Scott’s film and TV company Scott Free Productions.
“Tony was a big fan of Jesse’s. We met and talked about his ideas, and I said, ‘Well, what do you want to do? Film or TV?’ He said, ‘I really want to do comics, but you guys don’t do that’.”"

The accomplished Lee Man defender, Dudu, acknowledged his aspirational club had fallen beneath expectations this season, but the 34-year-old said Saturday’s gritty 1-0 win at Southern gave them a “real chance” of retaining their league title.
Champions after an unbeaten campaign last season, Lee Man have been peculiarly inconsistent this term.
Tsang Chiu-tat, the championship-winning head coach, left after his team lost the opening two matches of their abortive AFC Champions League Two campaign.
Replacement Matt Holland lasted only 13 games, which included Senior Shield final and FA Cup quarter-final losses, a 1-0 league defeat to leaders Tai Po, and a trio of consecutive extraordinary recoveries from two goals behind to beat North District, Kowloon City and Eastern.
Dudu praised Welshman Holland for instilling “professionalism and a British mentality”. “He [emphasised the requirement] to take every training session seriously and give our best,” Dudu added.
Nonetheless, Lee Man’s Jekyll and Hyde form has continued under caretaker boss Chu Siu-kei. The weekend’s victory, and a 1-0 win against Kitchee in his opening game, sandwiched a 7-3 home defeat by Tai Po that Chu called “unacceptable”."

Already the father of an eight-year-old, he juggles the responsibilities of his regular home life with taking care of his parents and working full time.
Michael, who only wanted to provide his first name, said the arrangement put him under a great deal of pressure.
He was initially reluctant to seek help caring for his father, who has hearing loss, and his mother, a wheelchair user.

Deepak Kumar – a luxury car dealer – was arrested for rash and negligent driving after a Lamborghini he was testing veered out of control and hit two construction workers in Noida, a city bordering the Indian capital, last Sunday.
On Monday, Kumar was allowed out on a bail of 25,000 rupees (US$300), triggering renewed fury online and fresh debate over the country’s uneven justice system.
A widely circulated video of the incident shows Kumar stepping out of the crashed vehicle and asking bystanders in Hindi, “Koi mar gaya kya?” (“Has anyone died?”).
The footage, filmed by a witness, has fuelled accusations of impunity for India’s affluent, especially when crashes involve poor pedestrians or roadside workers.
Gaurav, a bystander who witnessed the crash, told Indian news agency ANI: “The driver could not control the car, hit people and then crashed into the divider.”"

The 27-nation bloc faces 25 per cent import tariffs on steel and aluminium and cars and “reciprocal” tariffs of 20 per cent from Wednesday for almost all other goods.
Trump’s tariffs cover some 70 per cent of the EU’s exports to the US – worth in total €532 billion (US$585 billion) last year – with likely duties on copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and timber still to come.
The European Commission, which coordinates EU trade policy, will propose to members late on Monday a list of US products to hit with extra duties in response to Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs rather than the broader reciprocal levies.
It is set to include US meat, cereals, wine, wood and clothing as well as chewing gum, dental floss, vacuum cleaners and toilet paper."

Hong Kong is expanding transport services, including introducing two new cross-border buses, to prepare for a series of highly anticipated concerts by British rock band Coldplay later this week.
Transport authorities said on Sunday that the two cross-border buses would launch on Tuesday. The band will perform at Kai Tak Stadium starting from the same day and wrapping up on Saturday.
Authorities will also operate a bus route, SP12, for concertgoers travelling between the venue and the Lok Ma Chau-San Tin public transport interchange for crossing over to Shenzhen via the Yellow Bus route.
Another route, A25S, will help Coldplay fans travel from the stadium to the local checkpoint on the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, ensuring access to the city’s airport or Macau and Zhuhai via the Gold Bus.
The Transport Department said it had arranged 11 special bus services between Sung Wong Toi Road and major districts across the city.
“As the traffic in the vicinity of Kai Tak Sports Park is expected to be heavy, spectators should opt for public transport and avoid driving,” a spokesman said."

What do people need when it comes to transport? To get from Point A to Point B. It’s as simple as that.
Look at the recent global survey by Time Out which put Hong Kong at the top of a ranking of the best public transport systems in the world. Time Out surveyed more than 18,500 locals in over 50 countries, and 98 per cent of Hongkongers said they were happy with the city’s public transport.
The city government should take this as positive feedback. After all, it was the people it serves who decided whether the service they receive is any good. We should take pride in a public transport system – one which has been planned and built across decades – that conveniently and efficiently takes commuters from Point A to Point B.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Sunday rejected direct negotiations with the United States as “meaningless”, after US President Donald Trump said he would prefer direct talks with the Islamic republic.
Trump had called last month on Tehran to hold negotiations on its nuclear programme with Washington, but threatened to bomb Iran if diplomacy fails.
On Thursday, the US president said he would prefer to hold “direct talks” with Iran.
“I think it goes faster and you understand the other side a lot better than if you go through intermediaries,” he argued.
But on Sunday, Araghchi said “direct negotiations would be meaningless with a party that constantly threatens to resort to force in violation of the UN Charter and that expresses contradictory positions from its various officials”.
“We remain committed to diplomacy and are ready to try the path of indirect negotiations,” he added, according to a foreign ministry statement."

Less than 30 per cent of organisations in Hong Kong have established guidelines for employees using artificial intelligence (AI), the city’s privacy commissioner has said, urging companies to avoid inputting sensitive data into such tools as much as possible.
Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung Lai-ling said on Sunday that further amendments to the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance were needed to reduce the risk of data leakage, after her office released guidelines aimed at helping companies regulate AI use among staff.
She said the use of generative AI tools in the workplace was becoming increasingly prevalent.
But Chung noted that while 68 per cent of organisations were aware of the associated privacy risks, only 55 per cent had developed an AI policy or were planning to create one.
“The number that have actually formulated one is less than 30 per cent,” she told a radio programme.
Chung said small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) could lack the resources to develop internal AI usage policies.
She also called on organisations to minimise the inclusion of personal data in AI inputs. A retail fashion design company, for example, could include information related to orders, such as sizes and style, to conduct a preference analysis, without inputting customer names, she said."

Tariffs imposed by the US will inevitably have a short-term impact on Hong Kong as an international trading hub, the city’s finance chief said, as he vowed to prepare for the worst and take action to support businesses.
“As an international trading hub, Hong Kong will inevitably be affected to a certain extent in the short term,” Chan wrote on his weekly blog.
His predecessor, John Tsang Chun-wah, also warned that US President Donald Trump’s global tariffs could lead to the collapse of the current international order and global supply chains.
Trump last week announced sweeping tariffs on his country’s global trading partners, with a fresh 34 per cent levy on Chinese goods, including those from Hong Kong.
When combined with the existing duties on Chinese goods, the tariffs will go up to 54 per cent. In a tit-for-tat move, Beijing said on Friday it would impose a 34 per cent tariff on imported American goods."

As the world is consumed by seemingly intractable crises, the norms and values that once guided professional responses are being challenged daily.
From international humanitarian law, which governs the conduct of war, to humanitarian aid, public health, and even journalism, the frameworks that once ensured impartiality, probity, and fairness have been shaken – and in some cases, undermined.
“Decoupling and derisking has disrupted trade. Justice for Palestine is more remote than ever, and unauthorised wars are being launched without UN Security Council approval,” veteran Chinese diplomat Lu Kang lamented in a recent speech.
Clearly, notions of balance and objectivity are easily misunderstood – especially when people argue for what is effectively false balance or moral equivalence when pushing their agendas. As the philosopher Hannah Arendt argued, impartiality should not be confused with scientific objectivity."

Verstappen crossed the line for his 64th victory to a huge ovation from the 115,000 crowd some 1.4 seconds ahead of McLaren’s championship leader Lando Norris in second place.

As President Donald Trump’s sweeping global tariffs took effect this weekend, US farmers hoping for a profit this year instead found themselves facing lower crop prices – and the prospect of ceding more ground in foreign markets.

And dozens of economies, including the European Union, China and India, are set to face even higher levels – tailored to each party – starting on Wednesday.

Ex-Liverpool and Real Madrid star Steve McManaman said Trent Alexander-Arnold could opt against following in his footsteps if the Reds win the Premier League.
It is an open secret that the Spanish giants want to complete a free-transfer swoop for Alexander-Arnold when the player’s Anfield contract runs out this summer.
Publicly, the 26-year-old has made no decision over his future, and McManaman, who won two Champions League titles during four years in Spain, said he disagreed with the belief that the move to Real Madrid was a done deal.
He also questioned why a player born just a stone’s throw from Liverpool’s Melwood Training Ground was subject to more criticism over a potential move than foreign teammates Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah, who also become free agents from July 1.

Al Zaabi now leads Al Nasser, an Abu Dhabi-based company that is focused on energy, sustainability, construction, logistics and manufacturing. His visit to Hong Kong on April 3 was his first since the Covid-19 pandemic began, with a long-term goal to “identify global partners”, he said. He is the son of the family firm’s owner.

A Hongkonger was among at least 44 people injured when two tour buses collided in Japan on Saturday, according to the city’s immigration authorities.
A travel agency also revealed on Sunday that six Hong Kong residents had been travelling on one of the two Tokyo tour buses at the time of the accident.
It was not immediately clear which bus the injured Hongkonger was travelling on.
According to Japanese media, at least 44 people were injured when one of the buses was rear-ended by the other at around 10am on Saturday on a section of the Chuo Expressway near Hachioji, a city in the western part of the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan area.

Hong Kong has reversed the trend of its declining school population by adding about 4,500 students, a net increase that an industry leader has attributed to fewer families moving abroad and more professionals arriving under talent schemes with their children.
The increase came after more than 80,000 pupils left Hong Kong schools between 2019-20 and 2022-23 amid anti-government protests and the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Education Bureau recently submitted enrolment figures to the Legislative Council that covered all government, aided, private, international and direct subsidy scheme schools as of September 2024.
The Post calculated the net increase by comparing the enrolment figures for Kindergarten One to Form Five in September 2023 with those from Kindergarten Two to Form Six a year later to determine the population change.
The tally excluded the 2023-24 Form Six students, who later left to pursue post-secondary education or find work. There has been no headcount exercise after they left Form Six.
The number of pupils enrolled increased from about 741,000 to around 745,500."

Chinen recalls the moment vividly: it happened during a “contact event” in Nagano several years ago. These gatherings, popular among extraterrestrial enthusiasts, aim to initiate sightings or communication through meditation and group intention. Chinen first developed an interest in the existence of alien life shortly afterwards.
“We had not seen anything that we could definitely say was a UFO during the evening, but it was dark and there were stars and as we were talking, we saw lights moving around us,” he told This Week in Asia. “Suddenly there was one light – a huge ball of red light that expanded and then instantaneously disappeared.”
“There was one person in the group who was sceptical about UFOs,” he added. “And his back was turned at that very instant, but the rest of us saw it … that was enough to convince me.”
Asked if he felt fear during the encounter, Chinen shook his head. “They do not show themselves if they sense fear,” he said."

Sun Life Financial plans to hire more agents and expand new sales channels in Hong Kong to capture a bigger slice of the wealth management and retirement markets in Asia, according to its regional chief.
“We are partnering more with private banks in Hong Kong to address the overall financial planning needs of these customers,” said Manjit Singh, president of Sun Life Asia, in an interview. “There is a big need to help the high-net-worth customers with intergenerational financial planning, inheritance or liquidity management.”
The Canadian insurer expanded its pool of sales agents by 50 per cent to 3,000 last year in Hong Kong to prepare for a post-pandemic influx of mainland Chinese visitors. Its new insurance premiums rose 330 per cent between 2019 and 2024, lifting its ranking to fifth from 12th in terms of new policies in Hong Kong, according to industry data.
Its client base and premiums from wealthy clients in Hong Kong grew eightfold in that period.
Sun Life has about C$1.5 trillion (US$1.05 trillion) of assets under management globally. It operates in eight markets in Asia including Hong Kong, the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore, and is part of joint ventures in mainland China and India. The group has been doing business in Asia for 133 years, serving 30 million clients through 92,000 agents and 27 banking partners.
Mainland visitors to Hong Kong have been a big source of growth for global insurers, Singh said. Nearly 60 per cent of high-net-worth individuals in Greater China use insurance policies to transfer their wealth to the next generation, according to a Manulife and Deloitte survey in February."

Gas consumption in Hong Kong stayed below the pre-pandemic level for a sixth straight year in 2024, with the supplier expecting the pattern to persist due to what economists said was a “structural decline” in usage linked to lifestyle changes, including increased travel to mainland China.
The city’s sole gas supplier, the Hong Kong and China Gas Company, better known as Towngas, also linked its forecast to the warm weather expected this year.
Professor Lee Shu-kam, the head of Shue Yan University’s department of economics and finance, pointed to “a structural decline in sales” of gas in the city.
“A very important factor is the poor economy. When there are fewer tourists, shops will use less [gas],” Lee said. “What’s more important is that after the pandemic, many people have shifted to consuming more on the mainland.”
For instance, those aged 60 or above can travel by rail free of charge in Shenzhen by presenting their Home Return Permits, passports or other identity documents issued by the local government, according to a website of the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau.
The waived transport fares were “very attractive” Lee said. “But when you are up there, you definitely need to have meals.”"

Entrance exams featuring questions more suited to secondary school students are not uncommon in the elite kindergartens of Daechi-dong, an affluent neighbourhood in Seoul’s Gangnam district often dubbed South Korea’s “education capital”.
For parents, securing a spot for their child at one of these kindergartens offers a crucial advantage in the fierce competition for admission to the country’s top three universities – collectively known as “SKY”. A degree from one of these prestigious institutions is in turn widely seen as a golden ticket to social prestige, stable careers and lifelong success.
Choi Myung-hee, a professor of early childhood education at Shingu College with decades of experience in the ultra-competitive sector, traces the roots of the phenomenon to the rise of overbearing “helicopter parents” who are hypervigilant about their children’s success. These parents, born in the 1960s and 1970s, experienced South Korea’s rapid development and now channel their anxieties into securing their children’s futures."

How China is reshaping its economic ties with Africa
China’s role in Africa reflects one of the most significant shifts in global alliances and economic power dynamics over the past decade.
In 2024, China’s trade with Africa increased nearly 5 per cent year on year. Initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing’s plan to grow global trade, and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation have contributed to the rise of China as the continent’s top trading partner.
Despite its domestic economic slowdown, China’s relationship with African nations is evolving as Beijing shifts towards public-private partnerships and engaging financial institutions for project funding rather than traditional government-to-government loans. Trade is also diversifying, with Africa exporting more non-resource goods like coffee and avocados to China.
In this video, Africa expert Hannah Ryder and Post Africa correspondent Jevans Nyabiage discuss the evolving China-Africa economic partnership."

A planned reform to the Hong Kong stock exchange’s trading unit system should boost stock market turnover and encourage smaller investors, but implementing it will require investment to overcome technical challenges, according to brokers.
Both the exchange and financial firms would need to upgrade their systems to support changes to the board lot – the number of shares defined as a trading unit, they said. Currently, board lots are not standardised, and are generally large, which can discourage smaller investors.
Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po in his budget speech on February 26 called on bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) and market regulator the Securities and Futures Commission to propose an upgrade of the system this year. They should ensure the system “can better meet liquidity characteristics of shares of different sizes and investment needs, as well as facilitate trading and improve efficiency”, he said.
While players across the ecosystem agree with reform in principle, some are concerned that the upgrade will be costly, especially for smaller brokers.

Hong Kong should maintain its free-trade port status, which is crucial to consolidating its position as a global financial hub, some economists and business leaders have said, while calling for the city to avoid joining Beijing in imposing retaliatory tariffs on US goods.
But Executive Council member and lawmaker Jeffrey Lam Kin-fung said Hong Kong should consider following Beijing by imposing a 34 per cent tariff on some US imports to show support for the nation.
“Some merchandise, such as those items that easily have alternatives or substitutes like food or clothing, could be subject to tariffs,” he said. “For some essential equipment, such as for medical purposes, it should be exempted.”
In a tit-for-tat move, Beijing said on Friday it would impose a 34 per cent tariff on imported American goods, escalating trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies.
Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po on Sunday continued to emphasise the importance of the city’s status as a free-trade port after a day earlier suggesting there were no plans to retaliate against the latest round of levies.
The United States is Hong Kong’s second-largest export market, accounting for US$37.9 billion in merchandise in 2024, about 6.5 per cent of the city’s total exports, although its share has shrunk from 8.6 per cent in 2018."

Few who watched the recent four-part crime drama Adolescence on Netflix would have remained unmoved – whether by the powerful acting, the one-shot episodes, the tragedy of a teen murder, or the disturbing attitudes embodied in language.
“Manosphere” combines “man-” with “-sphere” to refer to a particular area of interest and the people associated with it, the word modelled after the coinage “blogosphere”.
While the term emerged online in 2009, the manosphere’s broader ideology has deep roots in 1970s movements advocating men’s rights, a backlash to feminism. Major manosphere communities include:
“Men’s Rights Activists” (MRAs), who advocate political changes to benefit men; their activism, however, consists of harassment and abuse of feminists and other female public figures.
“Men Going Their Own Way” (MGTOW), whose members hold that society is rigged against men and a system it is impossible to change, hence they advocate abstaining from relationships with women.
“Incels” – a portmanteau of “involuntary celibate” and a word originally popularised in the 1990s by a woman’s website – now encompasses the online subculture of young men who are frustrated by their lack of sexual experience, for which they blame women.
“Pick-Up Artists” (PUAs) are built around “game” – that is, techniques, strategies and mindsets that help men be more successful in attracting women. Many of these involve objectifying women and promoting harassment techniques, most notably “negging”.
“Negging” – from “to neg”, itself formed from clipping “negative” or “negation” – is the practice of ignoring, undermining or insulting a person, especially a woman, who one finds attractive in the belief that lowering their self-confidence will make them more interested in and receptive to the “negger”."

But experts warn its maritime defences are woefully unprepared for a modern conflict
But as the threat of conflict in the Asia-Pacific grows, the navy is confronting a 10-year capability gap. With an ageing fleet and dwindling firepower, it has become the focus of an increasingly acrimonious debate about how urgently Australia must prepare for war.
“Australia has no ability to wage a protracted conflict against a powerful adversary,” military historian John Storey told a recent Institute of Public Affairs seminar. “We cannot replace equipment losses, manufacture our own munitions, we have no capability to ramp up our defence forces in a crisis. And we have minimal capabilities to operate independently of a powerful ally.”
These concerns are amplified by a growing sense that time is running out.
Amid mounting unease over the war clouds gathering in its neighbourhood and growing doubts about America’s commitment to even its staunchest allies, Australia – and its navy in particular – is grievously unprepared should predictions of regional conflict prove prescient.
While the navy’s personnel are highly trained, its fleet consists of only 10 surface combatants: three relatively new Hobart-class air defence destroyers and seven ageing multirole Anzac-class frigates."

Do you eat breakfast? If so, what do you have?
The first meal of the day has long been seen as the most important, with research showing links between having breakfast and better health through lower incidence of diabetes and heart disease and a lower body mass index.
The rise in popularity of intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating has prompted many people to skip breakfast, however, and sparked a debate about this meal’s importance.
We asked four experts in nutrition, three of them in Hong Kong, whether breakfast is important, what they ate and the reasons for their choices. Their consensus: never skip breakfast, eat it not too long after waking – and include protein.

The US said on Saturday it would revoke all visas held by South Sudanese passport holders over South Sudan’s failure to accept the return of its repatriated citizens, at a time when many in Africa fear that country could return to civil war.
US President Donald Trump’s administration has taken aggressive measures to ramp up immigration enforcement, including the repatriation of people deemed to be in the US illegally.
The administration has warned that countries that do not swiftly take back their citizens will face consequences, including visa sanctions or tariffs.
South Sudan had failed to respect the principle that every country must accept the return of its citizens in a timely manner when another country, including the US, seeks to remove them, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.
“Effective immediately, the United States Department of State is taking actions to revoke all visas held by South Sudanese passport holders and prevent further issuance to prevent entry into the United States by South Sudanese passport holders,” Rubio said.
“We will be prepared to review these actions when South Sudan is in full cooperation,” Rubio said."

In collaboration with researchers from Tsinghua University, DeepSeek developed a technique that combines methods referred to as generative reward modelling (GRM) and self-principled critique tuning, according to a paper published on Friday. The dual approach aims to enable LLMs to deliver better and faster results to general queries.
The resulting DeepSeek-GRM models outperformed existing methods, having “achieved competitive performance” with strong public reward models, the researchers wrote. Reward modelling is a process that guides an LLM towards human preferences.
DeepSeek intended to make the GRM models open source, according to the researchers, but they did not give a timeline.
The academic paper, published on the online scientific paper repository arXiv, comes amid speculation about the start-up’s next move following the global attention garnered by the firm’s V3 foundation model and R1 reasoning model.
Reuters reported last month that DeepSeek-R2, the successor to R1, could be released as soon as this month, as the company rushes to capitalise on its rising profile. The release of DeepSeek-R1 rocked the global tech community with its cost-efficient performance that rivalled leading models.
DeepSeek has remained tight-lipped about the rumoured R2 release. It has not commented on the matter through official public channels, but a customer service account denied the report in a group chat with business clients, Chinese media outlets reported last month."

Urged to the lead at the 350m, Romantic Warrior looked to have Soul Rush’s measure for much of the home straight but the Japanese galloper found enough to get his nostril in front when it mattered.
The loss brings to an end Romantic Warrior’s arduous Middle Eastern mission, which began with an electric victory in the Group One Jebel Hatta (1,800m) at Meydan in January.
The seven-year-old then produced a heroic second behind Forever Young in a Group One Saudi Cup (1,800m) for the ages – an effort which must surely have had some impact on the champion galloper and makes his Dubai Turf effort even more admirable.
Saturday night’s runner-up effort pushes Romantic Warrior’s already world-record earnings past HK$214 million and the galloper will now be given a rest until next season.

The comments came as Trump’s widest-ranging tariffs took effect in a move that could trigger retaliation and escalating trade tensions that could upset the global economy.
“We have been the dumb and helpless ‘whipping post,’ but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before,” Trump wrote on social media.
“This is an economic revolution, and we will win,” he added. “Hang tough, it won’t be easy, but the end result will be historic.”
A 10 per cent “baseline” tariff came into place just after midnight, hitting most US imports except goods from Mexico and Canada as Trump invoked emergency economic powers to address perceived problems with the country’s trade deficits.

The action, filed by lawyers Norman Castro and Julio Macias with the country’s Supreme Court, targets the law that approved the 1997 concession contract between the Panamanian state and the Panama Ports Company, a subsidiary of CK Hutchison.
The lawyers alleged that the agreement violated fundamental articles of Panama’s constitution, undermining the country’s sovereignty, public interest and economic fairness.
Their arguments, laid out both in their petition and subsequent written submissions to the court, centre on claims that the concession improperly transferred sovereign powers to a private entity, failed to follow public bidding procedures required under the constitution and granted tax exemptions without proper legislative approval.
Under the concession agreement, CK Hutchison was granted the authority to restrict future port development in designated areas known as Diablo and Isla Telfers, and retained veto power over infrastructure projects in the surrounding region.
The lawyers contended that such powers should, under Panamanian law, belong exclusively to the state."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday hailed “tangible progress” after meeting British and French military chiefs in Kyiv to discuss strengthening the Ukrainian army and ways to support the war-torn country after any end of hostilities with Russia.
British Chief of the Defence Staff Tony Radakin and French counterpart Thierry Burkhard on Friday held talks with Zelensky, Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky and Defence Minister Rustem Umerov.
Zelensky wrote on social media on Saturday: “There is tangible progress and the first details on how the security contingent of partners can be deployed,” without giving details.
French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer are spearheading European efforts to send a “reassurance force” to Ukraine after any end to the war sparked by Russia’s invasion in 2022.
Zelensky thanked “the UK and France for their leadership”, saying “it is this kind of joint work, when everyone is focused on a strong result, that helps to bring a reliable and lasting peace to Ukraine.”
He said the allies are “making efforts to ensure security in Ukraine and reliable security guarantees”."

Sent off favourite for the six-furlong dash down the Meydan straight, Howdeepisyourlove looked to be travelling beautifully into the race from midfield until he clipped heels 500m from home and was pulled up by jockey James McDonald.
Treated on the track after suffering a partial dislocation to his left front fetlock, the five-year-old was taken to Dubai Equine Hospital for further examination but had to be humanely euthanised.
“Near the 500m clipped the hind leg of another runner resulting in the gelding becoming unbalanced, as a result being eased out of the race and the rider dismounting,” said the stewards’ report.
“When questioned, [McDonald] advised Howdeepisyourlove was travelling well until the 500m, where it clipped the hind leg of Marbaan.
“A post-race veterinary examination revealed the gelding to have subluxated its left fore leg.”
Howdeepisyourlove’s career featured six wins from 28 starts, with the highlight his victory in January’s Group Three Bauhinia Sprint Trophy (1,000m).
The George Boughey-trained Believing, who could only manage ninth in last April’s Group One Chairman’s Sprint Prize (1,200m) at Sha Tin, went onto win the race narrowly from Japan’s Win Carnelian, with Regional running third for Edward Bethell.
One race earlier, Sword Point had a torrid time of things when running last in the Group Two Godolphin Mile on dirt, struggling throughout before finishing 46 lengths off the victorious Raging Torrent.
Frankie Lor Fu-chuen’s Sword Point, who has prevailed twice on the Sha Tin all-weather track this season, didn’t enjoy the Meydan dirt one bit.
Also ridden by superstar Kiwi rider McDonald, the six-year-old galloper failed to take up a prominent position from gate two before resenting the kickback.
Owned by Yulong Investments, the Doug O’Neill-trained Raging Torrent was a popular winner under Frankie Dettori.
French galloper King Gold was three and a half lengths away in second, while Kazu Petrin grabbed third for Japan.
The night’s first race for thoroughbreds, the Group Two Dubai Gold Cup (3,200m), went to the home team, with Godolphin’s Dubai Future prevailing for trainer Saeed bin Suroor and jockey Silvestre de Sousa.
Earlier on Saturday, Hong Kong-based trio Zac Purton, Hugh Bowman and Andrea Atzeni left Randwick empty-handed after jetting down to Sydney for Doncaster Mile Day.
Zac Purton fared best of the trio, snagging a Group One third aboard Buffalo in the Inglis Sires’ (1,400m)."

Protesters returned to the streets across Spain on Saturday in anger over high housing costs with no relief in sight.
Thousands marched in the capital, Madrid, and over 30 other cities in a demonstration organised by housing activists and backed by Spain’s main trade unions.
The housing crisis has hit particularly hard in Spain, where there is a strong tradition of home ownership and scant public housing for rent. Rents have been driven up by increased demand. Buying a home has become unaffordable for many, with market pressures and speculation driving up prices, especially in big cities and coastal areas.
A generation of young people say they have to stay with their parents or spend big just to share a flat, with little chance of saving enough to one day purchase a home. High housing costs mean even those with traditionally well-paying jobs are struggling to make ends meet.
“I’m living with four people and still, I allocate 30 or 40 per cent of my salary to rent,” said Mari Sánchez, a 26-year-old lawyer in Madrid. “That doesn’t allow me to save. That doesn’t allow me to do anything. It doesn’t even allow me to buy a car. That’s my current situation, and the one many young people are living through.”
The average rent in Spain has almost doubled in the last 10 years. The price per square meter rose from 7.2 euros (US$7.9) in 2014 to 13 euros last year, according to real estate website Idealista. The increase is bigger in Madrid and Barcelona."

According to a paper published on February 18, all missiles were successfully detected and tracked by a new dual-band (S/X) phased array radar system, before hitting the target with 100 per cent success.
The test, detailed in Flight Control & Detection, a Chinese-language journal, marks the first public disclosure of China’s land-based early warning radar capabilities.
Its dual-band technology – similar to the US Navy’s USNS Howard O. Lorenzen missile-tracking ship – combines wide-area surveillance (S-band) with high-resolution targeting (X-band).
While the Lorenzen is hailed for its unmatched capability, with the potential to track more than 1,000 targets simultaneously, the United States has never publicly demonstrated its performance under live-fire conditions."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to visit the White House on Monday to discuss recently announced tariffs with US President Donald Trump, three Israeli officials and a White House official said on Saturday.
The impromptu in-person visit could mark the first by a foreign leader to meet with Trump and try to negotiate a deal to remove tariffs.
Netanyahu’s office has not confirmed the visit, that would likely also include discussions on Iran and Israel’s war against Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza. The visit was first reported by Axios.
The surprise invite by Trump came in a phone call on Thursday with Netanyahu, who is presently on a visit to Hungary, when the Israeli leader raised the tariff issue, according to the Israeli officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
As part of a sweeping new tariff policy announced by Trump, unspecified Israeli goods exported to the United States face a 17 per cent tariff. The US is Israel’s closest ally and largest single trading partner.
An Israeli finance ministry official said on Thursday that Trump’s latest tariff announcement could impact Israel’s exports of machinery and medical equipment."

Hong Kong’s second-largest public housing provider plans to send out a fresh round of tenancy agreements in September that will require well-off residents to pay extra rent, with those who refuse expected to move out in four months, the group’s chairman has said.
Ling Kar-kan, Hong Kong Housing Society chairman, also said on Saturday the body was confident that the new rules would stand up to legal scrutiny.
He said the new agreement, which requires tenants to regularly report their income and asset levels to the organisation, would be sent to about 25,000 households yet to be covered by the policy from September.
“If the tenants accept the terms, they can carry on paying rent in the following months. If they don’t accept the terms, they can inform us by not accepting the new tenancy agreement,” Ling told a radio programme.
The society’s chairman said those who refused to accept the new terms would be given a four-month grace period to move out.
Ling said the society had already conducted an assessment to ensure the policy could stand up to any legal challenges.
“We carefully looked into this and thoroughly consulted legal advice,” he said. “Our assessment is that even if we face any judicial challenges, we would have enough reasons [to make a case].”"

Libya’s suspension of 10 international humanitarian groups, part of a broader crackdown on African migrants, is aimed at masking domestic failures and securing external concessions, particularly from Europe, analysts have said.
Libya’s Tripoli-based authorities announced on Wednesday a decision to suspend the Norwegian Refugee Council, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Terre des Hommes, CESVI and six other groups, accusing them of a plan to “settle migrants” from other parts of Africa in the country.
War-torn Libya is a key departure point on North Africa’s Mediterranean coast for migrants, mainly from sub-Saharan African countries, risking dangerous sea voyages in the hope of reaching Europe.
Anas al-Gomati, director of the Tripoli-based Sadeq Institute think tank, said “this isn’t about NGOs – it’s about creating enemies to distract from failures”.
The UN-recognised government of Abdulhamid Dbeibah is “tapping into conservative anxieties while masking their inability to provide basic services”, Gomati said.
Libya has struggled to recover from the chaos that followed the 2011 Nato-backed uprising that overthrew long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi."

But experts say there is still a long way to go before China can compete with them, and the legal profession will need to do more to align with international practices and build trust.
There are already some 282 registered arbitration institutions in China, and the government has sought to promote its top-tier cities as alternatives to the world’s leading international arbitration centres.
The move is partly aimed at being able to better respond to the disputes that are arising as Chinese companies expand investment overseas, but legal professionals say that goal is still a long way out of reach.
“Various initiatives are under way across different Chinese cities, but they are still quite far from becoming true international arbitration centres,” according to Ma Zhihua, a partner with the DaHui Law Firm in Beijing.
“It has been discussed at high level and municipal level, but the actual progress and impact remain uncertain,” said Ma, who has worked in arbitration for more than two decades."

A senior United States official has discussed the importance of an ongoing audit of CK Hutchison’s management of two ports at the Panama Canal with the country’s foreign minister, amid controversy surrounding the Hong Kong company’s sales of the facilities.
Panamanian authorities announced their audit of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison in January after US President Donald Trump declared his intention to take back the Panama Canal, which he claimed was under China’s control.
The row soon escalated after CK Hutchison surprised markets in March by announcing it was selling all its overseas port operations, including the two in Panama, to a group led by investment firm BlackRock in a deal worth US$23 billion.
The deal also drew the ire of Beijing, which later said it would launch an antitrust probe into the arrangement.
On Friday, US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau spoke with Panamanian Foreign Minister Javier Martinez-Acha on further advancing ties between the two countries, while also addressing the issue of the port deal.
“The deputy secretary also recognised Panama’s actions in curbing malign [influence of the Communist Party of China] and discussed the importance of Panama’s ongoing audit of Hutchison’s management of concessions of two ports at either end of the Panama Canal,” US State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said on Friday."

All around a recent farm show in Canada, equipment salespeople struggled to swing deals with farmers worried about tariffs.
With some combines costing more than US$800,000, a surprise price increase from a tariff would be a hit most farm budgets cannot easily take.
Canada was spared the Trump administration’s broad global tariffs on April 2 but faces tariffs on steel and aluminium exports to the US as well as on autos not compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade.
As of Friday, Canadian farmers said they were unclear whether agricultural equipment is subject to the duties or to Canada’s retaliatory tariffs. Sorting out the details could take weeks.
Meanwhile, farmers’ appetite for new combines, tractors and other farm equipment has slumped, and manufacturers are pulling back.
In March, Case IH, an agricultural equipment manufacturer based in Racine, Wisconsin, and owned by global giant CNH Industrial, notified hundreds of workers in North Dakota and Minnesota of lay-offs. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

The death of Leung Nga-sze at the hands of her father has raised concerns about Hong Kong’s foster care system, with the child murdered just months after she was returned to her mother.
Lau Kai-ping, 42, was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison on March 26, with Madam Justice Anna Lai Yuen-kee saying the mother’s decision to allow the father, who had a history of violence, to live with the child “indirectly caused the tragedy to happen”.
During the month-long trial, the court heard that several government social workers had handled the child’s case, as well as an evaluation of whether the mother, Helen Leung, was fit to take care of Nga-sze.
Social welfare lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said the case “saddened” him.
“This [tragedy] happened, even though many social workers had worked with the child. It was very unfortunate,” he said.
Tik said social workers involved in assessing Helen Leung had done their part in checking whether she was fit to take care of a child, but “neglected that there was an abuser in the family”."

The Philippines expressed alarm on Saturday over the arrest of three Filipinos in China on suspicion of espionage, saying they were ordinary citizens and the arrests could be retaliation for Manila’s crackdown against alleged Chinese spies.
Chinese authorities arrested the Filipinos and accused them of working for the Philippine intelligence agency to gather classified information on its military, the state-run China Daily reported earlier this week, citing state security officials. It said the three had confessed to the crime.
The Philippines’ National Security Council disputed Beijing’s accusations, saying the three were former recipients of a government scholarship programme created under an agreement between the southern Chinese province of Hainan and the western Philippine province of Palawan.
“They are ordinary Filipino citizens with no military training who merely went to China at the invitation of the Chinese government to study,” National Security Council spokesperson Jonathan Malaya said in a statement.
“They are law-abiding citizens with no criminal records and were vetted and screened by the Chinese government prior to their arrival there,” he added.

Cambodia’s leader Hun Manet said on Saturday there was “nothing to hide” as he inaugurated a naval base renovated in recent years by China, after Washington had voiced concern over Beijing’s role in the upgrades.
The United States has said the Ream Naval Base, located off Cambodia’s southern coast, could give China a key strategic position in the Gulf of Thailand near the disputed South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost in its entirety.
Senior Cambodian officials have repeatedly denied that the base is for use by any single foreign power, following US media reports in 2022 saying that the new facilities at Ream were being built for the exclusive use of the Chinese navy.
Military representatives from various nations attended a ceremony on Saturday marking the inauguration of the renovated Ream base, with Cambodia rolling out the red carpet for a delegation from China’s People’s Liberation Army.
Prime Minister Hun Manet hailed the opening of the upgraded port at the event, where Cambodian and Chinese flags were flown.
“We hold the live inauguration today because we want both Cambodian people, and people and all forces around the world to stop casting doubt about it,” he said in a speech."

Hong Kong lawmakers have called for scrapping some civil service benefits amid a budget deficit, as the government revealed it spent more than HK$300 million (US$38.6 million) in a year on holiday bonuses and another HK$5 million on recreational facilities.
But the government defended the benefits, saying they were included in employment contracts and could help boost worker morale.
Figures provided by the Civil Service Bureau to the Legislative Council’s Finance Committee earlier this week revealed that more than HK$172 million was spent on the Long and Meritorious Service Travel Award Scheme in 2023-24, involving 2,414 civil servants.
The scheme offers holiday allowance to non-directorate officers who have worked for 20 years or more and have records of “consistently very good performance”.
A similar scheme called Leave Passage Allowance, targeting directorate officers, cost the public coffers HK$146 million in 2023-24, up from HK$93 million the year before
A total of 1,750 officers made claims under the allowance, with an average amount of HK$83,400 for each application. The average amount has gone up by nearly 40 per cent from HK$59,600 the year before."

“Of course barrier two helps a lot. The last two times I rode him, I drew outside and this time I’ve drawn inside, so I think it will make some difference,” said Poon, who piloted Dragon Joy to a win and then an eighth from his two runs before his ninth under Teetan.

Ever been moved to tears while cooking dinner? If not, you are probably not cooking with onions. For most of us, our eyes react this way because of a sophisticated self-protection system in these allium plants.
Jutta Papenbrock, a professor at the Institute for Botany at Leibniz University Hannover, in Germany, explains why cutting onions makes us cry, and ways to prevent it.
Sulphurous, volatile substances are produced when we cut onions, thanks to a reaction between the organic compound isoalliin and the enzyme alliinase, which are contained in onion cells, Papenbrock says. This substance helps protect onions by keeping predators like voles and rats at bay.
The two substances come together when an onion cell is destroyed, releasing a volatile mixture that irritates the eyes, which then produce tears to flush it out.
It is possible to genetically modify onions so that they do not contain these substances. But that also reduces the somewhat pungent flavour that we like in onions, she adds.
To lessen the release of this mixture, use a well-sharpened knife. It will divide the onion flesh, damaging and bruising the least number of cells – considerably reducing the chemical reaction that causes the irritation."

Thousands protested in the South Korean capital on Saturday in support of disgraced ex-president Yoon Suk-yeol, who was removed from office a day earlier over his bungled martial law declaration.
South Korea’s Constitutional Court unanimously ruled on Friday to remove Yoon over the December 3 attempt to subvert civilian rule, triggering fresh elections to be held by June after months of political turmoil.
A long wait for the court’s ruling had heightened tensions in the Asian nation, fuelling far-right support for Yoon and weekly rival rallies in capital Seoul.

Joao Moreira will ride the expected favourite Stellenbosch as he goes for two Group One wins in a row after claiming the Group One Takamatsunomiya Kinen (1,200m) at Chukyo on Satono Reve last weekend.
A four-year-old Epiphaneia filly, Stellenbosch has yet to finish out of the top three in eight career starts, with her last five all at Group One level, including four of them against her own sex.
She was first, second and third in the filly Classics and has excelled in the 1,600m-1,800m range. Third in December’s Group One Hong Kong Vase (2,400m) at Sha Tin, she’s had some rough runs, some poor luck in the draw and this could be her chance to bag her second big win.
Last year’s Osaka Hai winner Bellagio Opera aims to become the first horse in the race’s history to win consecutive versions.
The Lord Kanaloa-sired five-year-old has posted a decent, but not brilliant, third, sixth and fourth since. They were all in Group Ones and two over more ground than his best 2,000m. Unlike last year, however, he’ll be heading into the Osaka Hai first up.
Things get more interesting when one considers the growing reputation of the Osaka Hai as the place to land a horse’s first Group One.
Four other horses still chasing that prize are attracting extra attention due to a growing trend with the past four Osaka Hai winners all scoring the first Group One victory of their careers in this race – Lei Papale (2021), Potager (2022), Jack d’Or (2023) and Bellagio Opera (2024).
Sixpence, a Kizuna four-year-old, hails from the Miho barn of Sakae Kunieda and has won five of his six starts, with three of them Group Twos.
Though he has won racing to the right, it will be Sixpence’s first time at Hanshin and his first long haul from home. And, having last raced on March 2, this time will be his shortest time between races.
Lord Del Rey, also by Lord Kanaloa, is five years old and based at the western Japan training centre of Ritto near Hanshin. Highly consistent over 1,800m-2,200m, he has finished first or second in all but one of his nine races.
He won his first Group race, a Group Two at Chukyo in January, and has finished first and fourth at Hanshin. Last year, he didn’t make the final field.
“He couldn’t get in last year, but he has come along well without mishap this year and I think he has a chance,” said trainer Mitsumasa Nakauchida.
Yoho Lake, a Deep Impact seven-year-old from Ritto, shares his owner, trainer, and sire with Potager, the 2022 Osaka Hai winner.
Four of his five wins have come over right-handed courses (including Hanshin) in the 1800m-2200m range and, with rain forecast leading in to the race, Yoho Lake may prove an ace in the pack."

Earlier this week, the public safety ministry issued a separate warning reminding people to drive safely and be aware of the risks from bad weather.
On Friday, social media platforms were flooded with photos showing crowds in other popular tourist spots. One picture showed people jammed on a path up the Wutong Mountain on the edge of the southern city of Shenzhen, unable to move.

Four-time world champion Max Verstappen smashed the track record to snatch pole position for Sunday’s Japanese Grand Prix ahead of McLaren’s Lando Norris, as Yuki Tsunoda qualified a lowly 15th in his Red Bull debut.
A blistering lap of one minute, 26.983 seconds in his Red Bull put Verstappen 0.012 seconds ahead of championship leader Norris, with McLaren’s Oscar Piastri third.
Verstappen set a new Suzuka track record with his final lap in Saturday’s qualifying, pipping Norris right at the death.
“Each session we kept making little improvements, then the last lap was flat-out,” said Verstappen, who has won the Japanese GP for the last three years.

Already the holder of ONE Championship heavyweight kickboxing and Muay Thai world titles, Roman Kryklia rode a 14-fight winning streak into Bangkok, and added another victim to his list, flattening Britain’s Lyndon Knowles in the first round of their clash at ONE Fight Night 30 on Saturday.
The Ukrainian’s fifth consecutive knockout in the Muay Thai title bout came after an opening knockdown with a clean left hook.
While Knowles beat the count, Kryklia sealed the deal with a clean right cross that left the Englishman flat on the canvas. It was another savage finish, and came with a US$50,000 performance bonus.
Despite the frightening display of power, the double champ insisted he was only a threat inside the ring. Outside, he remains humble and composed.
“I want to say that I’m very dangerous only in the ring … but here outside, everything’s good!” Kryklia told the Post.
“Me and my friend, former ONE featherweight kickboxing champion Chingiz Allazov, we prepared many combinations, many difficult sides to analyse my opponent … but in reality, it was much easier. I threw my right arm – and everything else.”"

Hongkongers’ water usage has dropped by 12 per cent compared with during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, a city official has said.
Director of Water Supplies Roger Wong Yan-lok also said on Saturday that the government was still deciding how much to adjust prices by, about nine months after his organisation floated the idea.
He added that the department had learned from the hotel, catering and construction sectors that a gradual approach to such changes was important.
Wong said the average daily domestic water consumption per capita among Hong Kong households had decreased from 151 litres during the pandemic’s peak to the present level of 133 litres.
The department had earlier launched schemes targeting the top 1 per cent of high water consumers to reduce their usage and help the city save up to 500,000 cubic metres of water in 2025.
Water utilities in the city are currently priced at up to HK$9.05 (US$1.16) per cubic metre and have been frozen since 1995. The government also waived 75 per cent of water and sewage charges for non-domestic households during the pandemic."

“We have a 20th century president in a 21st century economy who wants to take us back to the 19th century,” Dartmouth College economics professor Douglas Irwin posted on social media.
The 19th century marked the golden age of tariffs in the United States, with an average rate regularly flirting with 50 per cent.
The century extended a doctrine adopted since the country’s founding, which advocated for the protection of the American economy as it underwent a period of industrialisation.
“Careful studies of that period suggest that the tariffs did help protect domestic development of industry to some degree,” said Keith Maskus, a professor at the University of Colorado.
“But the two more important factors were access to international labour, and capital … which was flowing in the United States during that period,” he added."

Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po has stressed the importance of Hong Kong maintaining a free and open economy, suggesting there are no plans to retaliate against the latest 34 per cent tariff the US has slapped on Chinese goods even though the city strongly opposes the measure.
But Chan said on Saturday that Washington’s sweeping global tariffs would affect sentiment, especially in financial markets.
He added that the government already had a mechanism in place to mitigate risks.
In a tit-for-tat move, Beijing said on Friday it would impose a 34 per cent tariff on imported American goods after US President Donald Trump escalated a global trade war by imposing duties on his country’s trading partners.
Asked whether Hong Kong would hit back at the United States, Chan said the city’s status as a free port was a core strength that would not change.
“The government of course resolutely opposes the tariff and will also come up with its own defence,” he said at an event held at the Hong Kong News-Expo."

Head coach Andrew Wright lamented a “pretty bad day all round”, and sent a stark warning over Hong Kong’s 2025 National Games prospects, after a series of sub-par performances in Saturday’s Asia Triathlon Sprint Championships.
The city’s best performers, Jason Ng Tai-long and Cade Wright, finished ninth in their respective men’s and women’s races on a wet course at the Central Harbourfront.
Any home top-five finishers would have secured Games qualification, but with only two more selection races remaining, in Chengdu and Samarkand next month, it is possible that Hong Kong’s triathletes will have to rely on discretionary picks.
“We made selection hard but achievable, and if no one gets it, it would be pretty disappointing,” Andrew Wright said.
There was a show of power from female mainland China athletes ahead of November’s event, which will be staged in Hong Kong.
Lin Xinyu and Yang Yifan, the winner of last month’s test event, came home first and second in 59 minutes and seven seconds, and 59.19, respectively. Their compatriot, Lu Meiyi, was seventh in 1:00:13."

This research was jointly conducted by researchers from Guangzhou’s Sun Yat-sen University, Fudan University and Liaoning University, and published in the journal Nature on March 27.
“Delivering vaccine antigens to CD8+ T cells [which are important to immune defences] requires three critical steps: cytoplasmic entry into antigen-presenting cells (APCs), APC activation and endoplasmic reticulum targeting,” said Wang Ji, a researcher with the Institute of Precision Medicine at the First Affiliated Hospital of SYSU, who is the corresponding author of the study. Wang made the remarks in an interview with China Science Daily on March 28.
The endoplasmic reticulum is often termed the cellular “highway” that links sub-cellular structures such as the nucleus and cytoplasm.
Traditional vaccine delivery resembles something akin to guiding hikers to a mountain base. But the team’s system SABER – which stands for STING Agonist-Based ER-Targeting Molecules – acts as a molecular “elevator”, bypassing cellular barriers to transport antigens directly to the ER, resolving the “last-mile” delivery challenge.
Experiments have shown that it functions like a dedicated “courier”, capable of accurately and effectively delivering antigens from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum."

Such units are among the thousands of troops that South Korea’s spy agency says Pyongyang has deployed to Russia to support Moscow’s war against Ukraine.
During the visit to a special operations unit on Friday, Kim said the “actual war capability for guaranteeing victory in the war field is bolstered up through intensive training,” the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.
He added that their training is “the most vivid expression of patriotism and loyalty to the country,” according to the agency.
Images released by state media showed Kim peering through the scope of a sniper rifle that KCNA said was going to be “newly supplied to special operation units”.
Other images showed him pointing to the bullseye of a target, crouching alongside heavily camouflaged soldiers, and smiling and waving to troops."

Here’s what we know about the case.
Kim Sae-ron was once one of South Korea’s most promising film stars. She began acting aged nine in A Brand New Life (2009), which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. She gained further recognition with The Man from Nowhere (2010) and A Girl at My Door (2014), also invited to Cannes.
Media and online commentators scrutinised her personal life. YouTube gossip channels accused her of exaggerating financial difficulties and questioned her sincerity. Critics, and her family, say it contributed to her declining mental health."

A triple-up on Newcastle players is a popular choice, given they face Leicester before games against Manchester United and Crystal Palace in Gameweek 32.
Nick Pope (£4.9m), Jacob Murphy (£5.0m) and Alexander Isak (£9.5m) are the best picks, but Kieran Trippier (£5.6m) could be a great differential. The defender is only owned by 4.2 per cent of players, and has started the past two games.
He currently has a knock and could miss the game, but if his injury is only minor, given Newcastle’s other injury woes, expect him to be in the starting XI going forward."

He was also aboard Helene Feeling on his following two starts, registering a third and close second at the city circuit, while Luke Ferraris hopped on for the former British galloper’s last start when he ran a brave third to Bundle Award.

“He’s been a model of consistency this season and continues to run really well,” Bentley said.
“I get on with him really well, he’s a jockey’s dream really. He’s a big horse with a big stride and sticks his head out all the way.”
A five-time winner from 24 local starts, Helene Feeling again carries top weight of 135 pounds when he drops back from 1,800m on Sunday.
Bentley hopes a kinder run from gate four in the small field of seven will boost Helene Feeling’s claims.
“There looks to be a little bit of pace in there with Voyage Samurai, so I imagine we just keep it simple with him,” Bentley said.
“He’s been relaxing really well and especially over the 1,600m, that’s not going to be an issue at all. I imagine we’ll just take a lead and the small field, you’d like to think that would make it a little bit easier.
“Naturally [the weight is] something to contend with, but he’s a big horse and he can carry the weight.”
In an even race that headlines the 10-race card, Helene Feeling takes on The Golden Scenery, Winning Dragon, C P Brave, Voyage Samurai, Snowfield and Woodfire Bro.
Bentley, who has ridden 20 winners this term, also has high hopes for promising four-year-old Flash Current in Sunday’s Class Four The CUHK Alumni Cup (1,200m).
The Jimmy Ting Koon-ho-trained gelding stormed home from last to score an impressive victory second up before running on strongly again for third behind Akashvani last start.
“Obviously his first run was less than ideal with nowhere to go, but I was happy to jump on him the next time and he won really well down the outside,” Bentley said.
“Last time was another really good run, but I think the horses on the front got an easy time of it and from my barrier, I just had to go a little bit further back. He’s coming into the race in good order and we hope for another good run.”
Flash Current and Akashvani clash again on Sunday, with Bentley’s mount the beneficiary of an eight-pound swing on David Hayes’ impressive debut winner.
Akashvani rises to top weight of 135 pounds and faces another wide draw in gate 14.
“He was obviously a pretty impressive winner in that race, so he’s going to be a horse I’ve got to keep my eyes on, but the fact he’s got an awkward draw perhaps brings things a bit more in line with me,” Bentley said of Akashvani.
“[Flash Current is] probably not the quickest into stride, but hopefully now he’s got a little bit more experience under his belt, he might be able to jump that bit faster and be in a slightly more prominent position. I have to see on the day and speak to Jimmy, but I presume we’ll be happier to get more of a midfield pitch.”
Perfecto Moments, Matters Most, King Of Dubai and Morgan Success are Bentley’s other rides on Sunday."

US President Donald Trump’s widest-ranging tariffs to date took effect on Saturday, in a move which could trigger retaliation and escalating trade tensions that could upset the global economy.
A 10 per cent “baseline” tariff came into place past midnight, hitting most US imports except goods from Mexico and Canada, as Trump invoked emergency economic powers to address perceived problems with the country’s trade deficits.
The trade gaps, said the White House, were driven by an “absence of reciprocity” in relationships and other policies like “exorbitant value-added taxes.”
Come April 9, around 60 trading partners – including the European Union, Japan and China – are set to face even higher rates tailored to each economy.
Already, Trump’s sharp 34-percent tariff on Chinese goods, set to kick in next week, triggered Beijing’s announcement of its own 34-percent tariff on US products from April 10.
Beijing also said it would sue the United States at the World Trade Organization and restrict export of rare earth elements used in high-end medical and electronics technology."

This story has been updated to clarify that it was estimated that each of three types of flexible work arrangements accounted for between 4 and 5 per cent of employees outside the government sector, not between 4 and 5 per cent of employees surveyed.
Only about 10 per cent of employees outside the government sector in Hong Kong have benefited from flexible work arrangements, according to official data, with some experts saying local companies have been slow to adopt policies over cost and productivity concerns.
Allen Cheung, who works in insurance, is among them. He typically spends two days a week in the office for meetings and training sessions, then dedicates another three days to following up with customers or checking the latest market information.
“My schedule is not fixed, and I can arrange my own activities for each day. There is no clear boundary between work and life, and I enjoy this type of working mode,” said Cheung, who is in his late thirties.
He said his industry was “performance-driven and client-centred”.
If clients travelled to Hong Kong to sign contracts, he needed to arrange his time around their schedules, even working weekends to handle tasks such as picking them up from the airport or showing them around the city, he said.
But Cheung said he could choose to take a break on weekdays when he had no meetings or client visits, which gave him time to enjoy activities such as reading or hiking."

The plunge in oil prices over the past two days following the twin shocks of President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the surprise boost in production from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) has altered the global energy landscape with stunning speed.
Brent crude, the global benchmark, tumbled 13 per cent through Thursday and Friday to just over US$66 a barrel, casting new doubts on Trump’s quest to aggressively boost US fossil fuel output and achieve “energy dominance.” Across the Atlantic, the sell-off is poised to ease soaring energy costs in Europe but also squeeze Middle Eastern petrostates.
Already the oil market is tossing aside expectations for 2025. Goldman Sachs, one of Wall Street’s long-standing crude bulls, cut its year-end price forecast on Thursday for Brent crude by US$5, to US$66 a barrel. Enverus has slashed more than a third from its demand-growth model. UBS Group, which at the start of the year forecast global demand would grow by 1.1 million barrels per day, is now cutting that up to nearly 50 per cent.
“The moment that President Trump put the tariffs that were hammering on Canada almost two months ago, we had already downgraded our forecast,” said Al Salazar, head of macro oil & gas research at Enverus. “The timing of the Opec announcement felt like them piling on.”
US oil futures settled near US$61 a barrel Friday – well below the US$65 threshold that many companies need to profitably drill new wells in Texas and surrounding states, according to a recent survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. The trade war, meanwhile, is driving up the price of the drilling equipment, with pipe costs rising about 30 per cent compared to levels before Trump imposed 25 per cent tariffs on steel last month."

The final vehicle will travel on the Tokyo Expressway on Saturday. Work on the KK Route will begin immediately afterward, ahead of events scheduled for April 18 to celebrate the opening of the Tokyo Sky Corridor.
On that day, participants are invited to walk along the 2km (1.2 miles) stretch of elevated roadway and engage in public discussions about the Tokyo Metropolitan Government’s plans to promote pedestrian-friendly lifestyles throughout the city.
The following day, the KK Line will host the Ginza Sky Run Challenge, a preliminary event for the marathon course for the Deaflympics, scheduled for November in Tokyo.
City officials estimate that developing the KK Route will take another five years. It will ultimately feature gardens, green spaces, art installations, viewpoints over the city, and areas where visitors can relax and enjoy peaceful moments.
The objective is to convert a 1966 highway built as part of the city’s modernisation into a lively tourist destination."

Anyone who recalls whispering at the dinner table as a child likely also has memories of being overheard and reprimanded by a sharp-eared mother – even as an oblivious father ploughed through his meal.
According to British and French researchers, the impression that women often have sharper hearing than men is now backed by scientific evidence.
Following tests on around 450 people across 13 countries, the team revealed results showing women “typically” having hearing amplitude that is around two decibels more sensitive than men’s.
“Women consistently exhibit higher sensitivity by two decibels” on average across the entire frequency spectrum tested in all populations sampled, the research team said in a paper published in the journal Scientific Reports.
Concluding that female ears can be up to six kHz sharper than male ears in some populations, the team said women not only show “heightened cochlear sensitivity” – referring to the fluid-filled part of the inner ear that helps convert sound waves to be read by the brain – but outdo men in other acoustic tests."

Ronin, a rat trained to sniff out explosives, has earned an entry in the Guinness World Records after finding a record 109 landmines and 15 items of unexploded ordnance in Cambodia’s northern Preah Vihear Province.
Belgian aid organisation Apopo revealed Ronin’s achievements on Friday, World Rat Day, which is marked every year on April 4.
Ronin, an African pouched rat, secured the record after being put to work in August 2021, beating all his peers. The five-year-old rat is the most successful in Apopo’s history, going back 25 years.
Ronin was described as “hardworking but also friendly and relaxed.”
Apopo’s Lily said: “Ronin’s success likely comes from his sharp focus, strong work ethic and love of problem-solving. His intelligence and natural curiosity help him stay engaged. Finding landmines is like a fun game to him, and no two days are the same.”
The rats are too light to detonate landmines and are able to track down the explosives in landmines faster than traditional metal detectors.
According to Apopo, there are more than 300 so-called HeroRATS working on various projects."

Multiple Ukrainians legally in the United States under a humanitarian programme received an email this week telling them their status had been revoked, and they had seven days to leave the country or the “federal government will find you.”
A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson said on Friday the email had been sent in error and that the Ukrainian parole programme created after the 2022 Russian invasion of that country had not been terminated. It was not clear how many Ukrainians received the email.
Reuters reported last month that the Trump administration was planning to revoke temporary legal status for some 240,000 Ukrainians who fled the conflict with Russia. Such a move would be a reversal of the welcome Ukrainians received under President Joe Biden’s administration.
“If you do not depart the United States immediately, you will be subject to potential law enforcement actions that will result in your removal from the United States,” the Thursday email read. “Again, DHS is terminating your parole. Do not attempt to remain in the United States.”
The Department of Homeland Security sent a follow-up note on Friday, telling them that the order was in error and that “the terms of your parole as originally issued remain unchanged at this time.”
One Ukrainian parolee, who asked that her name not be used for fear of retribution from the US government, said she “couldn’t breathe normally and was uncontrollably crying” upon receiving the email."

A federal judge on Friday ordered the Trump administration to arrange for the return of a Maryland man to the United States after he was mistakenly deported to a notorious El Salvador prison, while a US government lawyer was at a loss to explain what happened.
The ruling rejected the White House’s claim that it lacks the power to retrieve Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, because he is no longer in the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has corrected deportation errors in previous years, according to Abrego Garcia’s lawyer and legal experts.
The government filed an appeal immediately after the decision, while Trump administration officials repeated assertions that Abrego Garcia is a dangerous gang member and that US courts have no control over the matter.
“We are unaware of the judge having jurisdiction or authority over the country of El Salvador,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement following the ruling by US District Judge Paula Xinis.

The area around gas pipelines must be strictly safeguarded at all times, following the recent gas pipeline fire in Selangor, Malaysia, experts said, emphasising that no unauthorised work should be permitted. Even simple tasks like trimming grass within the designated area require permission and supervision from the owner.
A former Petronas safety officer said that residents should be safe if protection zones are respected.
“As long as the gas pipeline area is not disturbed and the gazetted area is respected, there is no reason for residents living near underground gas pipelines to worry,” Zakariah Yusoff said.
Zakariah, who maintained gas pipelines for 24 years, said Petronas prioritised public safety when laying out the pipelines.
The blast affected 1,254 people from 308 families in the area, with 87 houses suffering a “total loss” and an additional 148 houses requiring repairs.
Zakariah said the owner of the gas pipelines should have the final say on any work done in the gazetted area."

Elsie’s father dismissed the images as fakes, but the girls insisted they were real. Doyle, grieving his son’s death in World War I, had become deeply invested in spiritualism. He saw the photos as validation of his beliefs."

Hong Kong’s siu mai concern group strives to preserve iconic street food flavours
Hongkonger Andrew Wong Tsz-san is more passionate than most about Cantonese dim sum staple siu mai, a dish that inspired him to create an online group to gather fans of the street food favourite.
The freelance advertising professional, who is now the author of a book on the much-loved yellow-coloured dumplings, co-founded the Hong Kong Siu Mai Concern Group on social media with two partners in 2020.
“I believe most people were drawn to the group during the pandemic when going out to eat was no longer an option and social interactions were scarce,” Wong, 31, said.
“The more they bought frozen siu mai and cooked at home, the more people craved that street-side taste of having siu mai and fish balls.”
Traditionally, Chinese restaurants make the dish from ground pork, shrimp and mushrooms. But street vendors often use flour-based dough and fish paste.
Wong’s group was not alone during the pandemic, with similar ones popping up to serve as platforms for discussion among local food lovers craving authentic flavours."

Hong Kong’s first international beach tennis tournament sanctioned by the sport’s global governing body began on Friday, with 28 nationalities represented and comparisons drawn with the spirit of the city’s world-renowned rugby sevens showpiece.
Organisers hope that the debut edition in Discovery Bay can stimulate interest in a similarly fast-paced variant on a traditional game and be a stepping stone to staging higher-level International Tennis Federation (ITF) events.
Arnault Brac de la Perriere, unofficially the city’s leading player, was responsible for making ITF Beach Tennis World Tour Hong Kong happen. He said the aim was to generate a little of the party atmosphere, and tap into the accessibility, of the shortened form of rugby, as seen days earlier during the Hong Kong Sevens at Kai Tak Stadium.
“I see the joy that people get, it’s really like rugby sevens,” he said. “You have the stadium, a big party and the best players in the world coming.”
Getting the event off the ground was the culmination of three years of work, and the end goal is to bring a grand slam tournament to town, said Brac de la Perriere, who hails from the Indian Ocean island of Reunion and moved to Hong Kong 20 years ago."

An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that a junta air strike had accidentally hit a Chinese Red Cross rescue team. This has been corrected to clarify that the rescue team was fired upon, but was not hit.
As stunned, bloodied survivors sift through the rubble of the country’s deadliest earthquake in decades, bracing for even darker days ahead, junta chief Min Aung Hlaing is seizing the opportunity – to secure his grip on power and manoeuvre back into the diplomatic fold.
Shunned internationally in the wake of his 2021 coup, the general was even ostracised by the typically taciturn Association of Southeast Asian Nations bloc, which banned him from its summits for failing to follow an agreed peace plan.
Before the devastating 7.7-magnitude quake on March 28, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing’s forces were losing ground in a civil war triggered by the coup, relying on forced conscription and air strikes as rebel groups edged closer to the military’s heartlands.
Now, with his enemies preoccupied by the overwhelming humanitarian crisis, the junta chief has a momentary reprieve from war – and he is using it to rebrand himself as the stoic leader of a nation in need.
The timing of the once-in-a-century quake could not have been more fortuitous for a regime that had been floundering. The epicentre, Sagaing, is both a rebel stronghold and the site of brutal scorched-earth campaigns by the junta’s military. Villages there were razed, civilians slaughtered and pro-democracy fighters pushed underground."

Rising prices for sports goods made in Asia will be felt by American consumers after US President Donald Trump’s latest tariffs on China and its neighbours, Hong Kong experts predicted on Friday.
China and several Southeast Asian nations heavily involved in manufacturing for the world’s biggest sports brands were targeted by the United States in the tariffs announced on Wednesday.
Cambodia, Vietnam, China and Indonesia were hit with 49, 46, 34 and 32 per cent tariffs respectively on their exports to the US – potentially affecting the products of the likes of Nike, Adidas, Under Armour, Lululemon, On Holdings, Amer Sports and Hoka, all of which have some form of production in the region.
Nike’s 2024 annual report stated that Vietnam, Indonesia and China manufactured 50, 27 and 18 per cent respectively of its shoes in the preceding year. Vietnam also produced 28 per cent of the American company’s clothing, with China and Cambodia making 16 and 15 per cent respectively.
But Vera Yuen Wing-han, an economics lecturer at the University of Hong Kong, said that the impact on prices would harm American consumers.
“The tariff has been added to many countries, so it does not favour Vietnam, China or Cambodia,” she said. “But it’s too expensive to produce locally in America, so they will have to import, they have to buy, even if it’s a higher price.”"

Some observers have predicted that the move would fuel doubts about US reliability and even nudge Vietnam closer towards China economically, but others said Hanoi would continue its policy of hedging between the two superpowers.
“For Vietnam’s export-driven economy, the immediate economic hit is very damaging – both in trade and in foreign direct investment inflow,” Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow from the Vietnam Studies Programme at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said.
“But the longer-term damage could be worse: a breakdown of trust painstakingly rebuilt over decades between Washington and Hanoi. Trust, once broken, isn’t easily mended.”
The United States is Vietnam’s largest export market – with the value of US$142 billion, or nearly 30 per cent of its gross domestic product – and the steep tariffs appeared to take it by surprise. It recorded a trade surplus of US$123 billion with the US."

Texas Senator Ted Cruz, usually a staunch supporter of US President Donald Trump, sounded the alarm on the administration’s move to ramp up tariffs, saying they posed “enormous risks” to the US economy and made Republicans vulnerable to a “bloodbath” in next year’s midterm elections.
Long-term trade duties would drive up inflation and wreak havoc on markets, Cruz said on his podcast, which was released on Friday as a deep sell-off hammered US stocks for the second straight day. The economic fallout could help Democrats reclaim the House of Representatives and possibly even flip the Senate, although that’s less likely, he said.
“It would destroy jobs here at home and do real damage to the US economy if we had tariffs everywhere,” the Texas Republican said.
Cruz’s critique echoes the doubts of four Republican senators who this week rebuked Trump by siding with Democrats to back a measure that would have terminated the president’s previous levies on Canada.
As markets tumbled on Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators – including Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley – introduced legislation that would require congressional approval for new tariffs. Cruz said on Thursday that he was studying that proposal.

A top adviser to US President Donald Trump said that Washington’s support for Argentina’s ongoing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund hinges on President Javier Milei distancing himself from China, specifically by ending a currency swap agreement with Beijing.
Speaking at Miami Dade College on Thursday, Mauricio Claver Carone, Trump’s special envoy for Latin America, described Milei as “an ally” but stressed that Washington’s priority is to ensure any new IMF deal does not “reinforce China’s position” in Argentina.
“We want the famous credit line that Argentina has with China to end,” Claver Carone said, referring to the swap arrangement, which he labelled “extortionate”. He warned that as long as it remains in place, “China will always be able to extort Argentina.”
Currency swap agreements allow two countries to exchange currencies at a pre-agreed rate, providing one another with liquidity in times of need.
For Argentina, the swap line with China has been critical, as it enables the country’s central bank to access renminbi that can be converted into dollars, bolstering foreign reserves and, by extension, the Argentine government’s ability to repay creditors including the IMF.
With Argentina’s history of financial instability and limited access to international markets, the swap agreement with Beijing has acted as an essential financial backstop. Originally signed in 2009, it has been renewed and expanded several times."

Ainscough instead turned to Gerson therapy, an alternative cancer treatment that involves patients following a strict two-year organic juice regimen – drinking up to 13 glasses of fresh juice a day, taking dietary supplements and having daily coffee enemas.
Ainscough – the inspiration for the character Milla Blake, played by Alycia Debnam-Carey in the Netflix series – claimed to have healed herself.
She became well known for her alternative medicine blog, published three e-books and promoted alternative treatments with her “Wellness Warrior” events, inspiring countless cancer sufferers.

Two days after sending the economy reeling by announcing widespread tariffs, US President Donald Trump insisted his trade policies would never change as he remained ensconced in a bubble of wealth and power in Florida.
The worldwide sell-off for financial markets slammed into a higher, scarier gear on Friday as the S&P 500 plummeted 6 per cent, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 5.5 per cent and the Nasdaq composite dropped 5.8 per cent.
Markets are facing their worst crisis since the Covid crash after China matched Trump’s big raise in tariffs in an escalating trade war. The price of oil slid to its lowest level since 2001.
Meanwhile, the US president began the day at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach, and headed to his nearby golf course a few kilometres away after writing on social media that “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH”.

Britain’s Prince Andrew sent Chinese President Xi Jinping a letter on his birthday every year as part of a “communication channel” to support the British royal’s platform for entrepreneurs, according to court documents published on Friday.
The documents came to light following a legal challenge brought by Chinese businessman Yang Tengbo, who was described as a “close confidant” of Andrew and was banned from Britain on the grounds he was a suspected Chinese spy.
Yang, who has said that “the widespread description of me as a ‘spy’ is entirely untrue”, is appealing against the rejection of his challenge to the decision to ban him from the country.
Documents released by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission on Friday included a witness statement provided by Dominic Hampshire, who became Andrew’s senior adviser in 2019.
Hampshire said in the statement that Andrew had regular communication with China’s Xi in relation to the prince’s Pitch@Palace initiative to encourage entrepreneurs.
“The Duke has always had a communication channel with the President, largely to support the success of Pitch@Palace in China, and this was never hidden,” Hampshire said."

US President Donald Trump on Friday failed to outline a deal to sell Chinese-owned TikTok to American investors, and issued an executive order pushing back the deadline to finalise an agreement, which will keep the popular short-video app alive.
“My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress. The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days,” he said in a social media post.
A representative of ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese parent, said in a statement that it had been in “discussion with the US Government regarding a potential solution for TikTok US.”
“An agreement has not been executed. There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law,” it added.
Trump said his administration hoped to “continue working in Good Faith with China, who I understand are not very happy about our Reciprocal Tariffs (Necessary for Fair and Balanced Trade between China and the U.S.A.!)”"

A phone call between US President Donald Trump and Vietnam’s leader To Lam is set to “cool down” the temperature and allow further negotiations, with the Southeast Asian nation bearing the brunt of America’s sweeping tariffs, according to observers.
The talk between the two leaders is also a clear indication that under the transactional approach embraced by the Trump administration, tariffs are negotiable.
During the call described by Trump as “very productive”, both sides agreed to discuss a deal to remove the 46 per cent tariffs imposed on Vietnam.
Trump said on social media his Vietnamese counterpart had told him that “Vietnam wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they are able to make an agreement with the US”.
“I thanked him on behalf of our country, and said I look forward to a meeting in the near future,” the American president said, after the call which took place on Thursday night, Vietnam time.
The two leaders agreed they would continue talking “to soon sign a bilateral agreement” on tariffs, the Vietnamese government said, adding that Trump accepted an invitation to visit the country soon."

S&P Global Ratings on Wednesday downgraded Longfor’s long-term issuer credit rating to BB from BB+ and its senior unsecured notes to BB- from BB, citing concerns that the company’s contracted sales could remain under pressure through next year due to a further depletion of saleable resources.
The company’s contracted sales could decline a further 13 per cent this year to 89 billion yuan (US$12.3 billion), the ratings agency said. Longfor’s gross profit margin from property development was expected to remain suppressed at 5 to 6 per cent, down from 11 per cent in 2023, as its focus on clearing inventory continued to weigh on profitability, S&P said.
“While we believe the company will be able to reduce adjusted debt of about 10 billion yuan each year in 2025 [and] 2026 using its growing rental and service income, weakness in property development will partially offset this,” wrote S&P analysts Wilson Ling and Edward Chan."

A veteran Hong Kong property investor has sold a shop in Jordan at a loss of more than 30 per cent as the market remains depressed amid falling retail sales and high interest rates.
Edwin Lee, the founder of Bridgeway Prime Shop Fund Management, the first Securities and Futures Commission-licensed fund manager focused exclusively on shops and retail property, said his fund on Monday sold a ground-level shop at 126-128 Woosung Street for HK$18.7 million (US$2.4 million) after acquiring it for HK$27.5 million three years ago.
A gauge of private retail properties compiled by the Rating and Valuation Department has slumped nearly 30 per cent since Lee acquired the asset in July 2022. The index stood at 380 in December compared with a peak of 601 in November 2018 when the city’s property market was booming.
“To maintain the fund’s liquidity, we will continue to buy and sell shops with good potential,” he said. “Just like developers, we can’t hoard our stocks and wait while the market continues to drop.”
Lee, who forayed into property investments in 2009, said it was his fund’s first loss since it was set up in 2016. He said the sale was not due to any liquidity problems and the fund was not under any financial pressure.
Lee said Bridgeway would continue to offload retail units as sentiment in the property market continues to improve, citing rising transactions driven by a stock market rally.
Banks in Hong Kong are wary of non-performing loans and rising leverage among their clients because of high borrowing costs. They have been asking borrowers to cover the difference in mortgages because of falling property values, forcing some owners to sell at distressed prices to raise cash."

City University (CityU) was the only one from Hong Kong to fall in the rankings, finishing a place lower in 16th.

Set to ride consistent galloper Happy Together in Sunday’s Champions Mile, the Frenchman tuned up for the city’s second biggest meeting of the year with wins on Winning Heart, Leather Master and Power Koepp.
“It’s important, my form’s good,” Badel said after moving to 25 wins for the campaign.
“I feel good. I’ve had decent support and a nice book of rides and it’s nice to deliver.”

Frankie Lor Fu-chuen’s Happy Together faces a tough test against the likes of star miler Voyage Bubble and nine-time Australian Group One winner Mr Brightside in a strong edition of the Champions Mile.
However, the six-year-old has been a model of consistency in Hong Kong with six wins and three top-five finishes in his three Group One starts.
“Happy Together is my faithful friend and I believe his form is good and I think it’s interesting to see him over the mile,” Badel said.
“I think it makes it more simple. It’s a tough race but he’s so honest. He’ll run a place.”
Badel bagged the opening two races at the Valley, with Tony Cruz’s Winning Heart overcoming a wide run throughout to claim the Class Five Flamingo Flower Handicap (1,200m) before Manfred Man Ka-leung’s Leather Master broke through for his first triumph at start 20 in the Class Five Freesia Handicap (1,800m).
Power Koepp continued his top form since a transfer to Mark Newnham, landing his second win from three starts for his new stable in the Class Three Kalanchoe Handicap (1,200m).
Perfectly placed by Badel in the box seat from gate two, the seven-year-old surged to the lead passing the 200m and held off a gutsy Lucky Eight to win by a short head.
Elsewhere on Wednesday night, the Valley’s leading trainer Caspar Fownes and his apprentice Ellis Wong Chi-wang teamed up for a race-to-race double with Super Sixty and Sky Cap.
It was 24-year-old Wong’s first brace since May last year.
“It’s very nice. He’s a good kid, so hopefully he’ll kick on from this,” Fownes said.
“He gave them nice rides, they were deserving of their victories and hopefully he can get some more support now and more winners.”
Wong capitalised on gate one to spear Super Sixty along the inside for a fast-finishing win in the Class Four Geranium Handicap (1,000m) before making all on Sky Cap in the Class Four The Lusitano Challenge Cup (1,200m).

Starting a $29.9 outsider after finishing no better than seventh from his five starts, Capitalist three-year-old Sky Cap kicked clear in the straight and hung on late to beat Bienvenue by a neck.
“It was a surprise, but his last run was a lot better. He was only beaten three and a half lengths at Sha Tin and came here with an inside gate [two],” Fownes said.
“He was going to be competitive but winning or not, you don’t know. We’re just happy to get the result.”
Cruz shared training honours with Fownes after also notching a brace with Winning Heart and Fallon, who continued his consistent form with a strong win under Ben Thompson in the Class Three Roselle Handicap (1,800m)."

The absences suggest that these companies may be grappling with sharply dropping sales in mainland China or suffering a financial squeeze despite fanfare and enthusiasm around the sector, which is a bright spot in the national economy.

Geely Auto’s premium electric vehicle (EV) brand Zeekr debuted its flagship luxury SUV, the 9X, on the opening day of the Shanghai Auto Show on Wednesday, marking the brand’s first foray into hybrid models as it continues to expand globally despite rising geopolitical tensions and tariff disputes.
Powered by CATL’s battery technology, the new model boasts an all-electric driving range exceeding 380km (236 miles) – the longest among hybrid SUVs worldwide – and accelerates to 100km/h (62mph) in just three seconds, according to the carmaker.
Some people have jokingly given the model from the Hangzhou-based carmaker the nickname “Hangzhou Bay Cullinan”, referring to the Rolls-Royce model that sells for as much as US$500,000.
While Zeekr did not disclose detailed pricing, the 9X will start at around 1 million yuan (US$140,000) based on previously published information, positioning it directly against premium foreign rivals like Mercedes-Benz and BMW. Deliveries are expected to begin in the third quarter of this year.
The vehicle, which uses two Nvidia Thor chips, is equipped with Zeekr’s in-house G-Pilot autonomous driving system, launched last month, for Level 3 autonomous driving, which allows for “hands-off” driving based on standards set by US-based SAE International.
“Breaking the monopoly of luxury brands, not only in the MPV segment but also in SUVs, is crucial for Chinese EVs to surpass traditional luxury giants,” Zeekr CEO Andy An Conghui said as he unveiled the vehicle on Wednesday morning."

German companies in China are being affected by rising trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, a survey by the German Chamber of Commerce in China has found.
The flash survey of 143 member companies, conducted between April 14 and 17, found that 86 per cent of respondents had been affected by the latest round of tariff increases, with the proportion rising to 93 per cent in the automotive sector.
Among those surveyed, 9 per cent said they had been “very strongly” affected by Chinese trade measures, while 8 per cent said the same about American ones.
The proportion that said US tariffs had a direct impact on their operations than other trade instruments – 36 per cent – was the same as those most affected by Chinese tariffs.
“It is concerning that the vast majority of German companies in China are affected by the escalated trade conflict,” said Maximilian Butek, executive director and board member of the German Chamber of Commerce in East China.
“We expect that German companies’ localisation efforts in China will gain even more momentum now.”"

Starting May 1, foreign tourists entering Thailand will be required to submit their arrival details online, regardless of whether they arrive by air, sea or land.
This marks the reactivation of the TM6 arrival form, which was initially abolished in 2022. However, the process has now been modernised, with the form replaced by the Thailand Digital Arrival Card (TDAC), which must be completed online before arrival.
The reintroduction of the TDAC aims to streamline immigration processes and reduce waiting times. Additionally, the digital data will facilitate faster coordination with consulates and the Disease Control Department.
The form will collect personal information, details about the length of stay, and accommodation arrangements.
This change reflects Thailand’s efforts to modernise its entry procedures and improve efficiency for both tourists and authorities.
The new arrival card comes as Thailand braces for a surge in visitors this year after millions worldwide watched the third season of hit HBO series The White Lotus showcasing a Thai luxury resort."

On Nomination Day, last-minute ministerial redeployments added an element of surprise, setting the stage for fierce competition in the group representation constituencies (GRCs) of Punggol, Tampines and West Coast.
Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong has left his long-held Chua Chu Kang GRC for the newly created multi-seat Punggol GRC, while Manpower Minister Tan See Leng, previously expected to lead the team in Marine Parade-Braddell Heights, has shifted west to Gan’s former ward. These moves came despite both ministers earlier announcing they would remain in their respective constituencies.
In Punggol, Gan faces a formidable challenge from the Workers’ Party’s (WP) star candidate, legal counsel Harpreet Singh, who leads their team. However, Gan’s high profile and deep popularity are expected to make this a closely contested fight.
The anticipated contest in Marine Parade-Braddell Heights GRC fizzled out after the WP opted not to field a slate there, handing the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) an uncontested victory for the first time since 2011.
In East Coast GRC, a former hotbed of competition during the 2020 general election, the WP has returned to contest but without its top candidates this time. Analysts believe this may have influenced the PAP’s decision not to deploy senior figures such as Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat or Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, both of whom announced their retirement from politics shortly after nomination proceedings concluded."

A newly discovered karst cave dating back 480 million years in remote southwest China has revealed a pristine sediment “gene pool” that experts say has not been seen before.
But they say it must be protected before it is too late, warning it is under threat from people – particularly social media influencers – entering the cave and causing irreversible damage to its fragile structures.
Cave explorer Zhao Jieyu first ventured into the cave – which is hidden beneath a steep mountain in Daozhen county, Guizhou province – in 2021.
He describes a rich subterranean world of snow-white crystal flowers, luminescent “cave pearls” and gravity-defying cone-shaped formations – all sculpted over time by the mineral-rich water that filters down through the cave’s ancient sedimentary rock.
Zhao and geologist Zhang Yuanhai, who visited the cave for the first time earlier this month, say the calcite deposits that have formed have been seen in hypothetical models before, but never in real life.
Zhao is the deputy secretary general of the Geological Society of China’s Speleology Committee and has been exploring caves for nearly two decades. He had kept the discovery quiet until recently to protect the cave.
It has now drawn the attention of state media – official news agency Xinhua reported on the cave in mid-April – and online influencers. According to Zhao, visitors have been entering the cave and trampling on its delicate formations, and in some cases snapping off centuries-old crystals and taking them away."

Yeoh emphasised that Malaysian football’s troubles require comprehensive solutions rather than piecemeal fixes.

“I’ve asked [the] AFC (Asian Football Confederation) to do an assessment. They have given me a report, and we will discuss it with FAM. We can’t look at one case only,” she said.
“We have to see it holistically. In our future meeting, we will discuss with FAM on how to improve the current ecosystem. Not just at the national level, but we want to see improvements in these clubs.”"

Three generations of the Hayes family have built an imposing legacy over 78 years, with the Lindsay Park name a constant force in Australia’s biggest races.
But on Hong Kong’s second-biggest meeting of the year, Ben Hayes – who trains Mr Brightside in partnership with brothers Will and JD – said winning the Champions Mile and their father David claiming the Chairman’s Sprint Prize (1,200m) with Ka Ying Rising would be an unmatched feat for the famous family.
“If we’re able to get the dream and they both win, it will probably be the best day Lindsay Park and our dad have ever had together,” Ben Hayes said.
“It’s very unique. We get to have a Group One runner on the same day as our dad.”
The late Colin Hayes started the dynasty when he launched his training career in South Australia in 1947. In a 43-year career, he prepared 5,333 winners – including 524 Group and Listed winners – and was inducted into the Australian Racing Hall of Fame.
His son David took the reins of Lindsay Park in 1990 at the age of 28 and made an immediate impact, which led to the opportunity to train in Hong Kong in 1996.
In his first stint in the city, David won two championships, and a Hong Kong Sprint (1,200m) and Hong Kong Derby (2,000m), before returning to Australia in 2005.
David became the first trainer in Hong Kong’s professional era to return to train in the city in 2020, with Lindsay Park left in good hands with his nephew Tom Dabernig and eldest son, Ben.
In 2023, Ben was joined in a training partnership by twin brothers Will and JD, and Mr Brightside quickly established himself as the trio’s flag-bearer.
Mr Brightside has often been considered for a trip to Hong Kong but finally makes his international debut on Sunday, bidding to add to his strong record, which includes 19 wins and a close second to Hong Kong champion Romantic Warrior in the Group One Cox Plate (2,040m) at Moonee Valley.
“From a travelling point of view, couldn’t be happier with the way he’s settled in,” said Ben Hayes, who spent many of his formative years in Hong Kong along with his brothers during David’s first stint in the city.
“We feel he’s heading in the right direction heading into Sunday.”
In one of the strongest editions of the Champions Mile in recent years, Mr Brightside takes on the likes of Hong Kong’s star miler Voyage Bubble, fellow Australian galloper Royal Patronage, Classic Mile hero and Hong Kong Derby runner-up My Wish, and Japan’s Gaia Force.
“It is a strong race, but he is a nine-time Group One winner. He deserves to be here and if you look at his record, he’s always around the mark,” Ben Hayes said.
“Obviously the favourite [Voyage Bubble] is going to be very hard to beat. One thing in our advantage, I know this track drains very well but he will get a track with give.
“If he gets a track with give, he improves. If you look at his wet-track record, he’s nearly undefeated, so that would give us more confidence. If we get a barrier where he can take a sit, that would give us confidence again. We’re very happy with him.”
Top Australian jockey Craig Williams will ride Mr Brightside, while Ka Ying Rising will be a raging favourite to notch a 12th consecutive victory in the Chairman’s Sprint Prize.
The Hayes family will be represented in all three Group Ones on Champions Day, with David’s Classic Cup (1,800m) winner Rubylot set for the QE II Cup (2,000m)."

Americans elected President Donald Trump in hopes that he would fight inflation and boost the US economy, but as he approaches his 100th day in office, they are giving the Republican poor marks for his handling of both, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows.
Trump has kicked off his term with an aggressive economic agenda, sparking trade wars as he slaps tariffs on major US trading partners, trying to pressure the Federal Reserve to bend to his will and setting off the worst sell-off in US financial markets since the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic five years ago.
Just 37 per cent of respondents to the six-day poll that concluded on Monday approved of Trump’s handling of the economy, down from 42 per cent in the hours after his January 20 inauguration, when he promised to supercharge the economy and bring about a “Golden Age of America”. The reading is well below than at any point in his first term, when it ranged from the mid-40s to mid-50s.
“You have a president who promised a golden age,” said James Pethokoukis, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. “But everything that’s supposed to be up is down, everything that’s supposed to be down is up.”
Pethokoukis said the economic warning signs put pressure on Trump to reverse course on tariffs, but that even if Trump caved, the economy might not quickly bounce back amid the chaos.
In a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted just after Trump’s inauguration, some 55 per cent of respondents said either inflation or the broader economy should be Trump’s main focus in his first 100 days in office, which run through April 30. Twenty-three per cent picked immigration.
Three months later, three-quarters of the respondents in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll said they worried a recession was coming. Fifty-six per cent of respondents, including one in four Republicans, said Trump’s moves to shake up the economy are “too erratic”."

Hong Kong’s rail operator wants to increase Airport Express fares, sparking concerns over whether the proposed price of HK$120 (US$15) to the city centre is too expensive.
The Post looks into the proposed fare changes and alternative options for residents and tourists travelling to and from the airport.
The Airport Express, which began service in 1998, offers a 24-minute journey spanning 35.3km (29.1 miles) from Hong Kong International Airport to Hong Kong station in Central.
A single journey ticket for adults using an Octopus card currently costs HK$110 to Hong Kong station, HK$100 to Kowloon station and HK$65 to Tsing Yi. The MTR Corporation submitted a fare adjustment proposal to the Legislative Council on Tuesday, hoping to raise the price to HK$120, HK$105 and HK$73, respectively, from June.
Adult single tickets to the airport without an Octopus card will cost HK$130 from Hong Kong station, HK$115 from Kowloon station, and HK$80 from Tsing Yi, representing increases of HK$15, HK$10 and HK$10, respectively.
“To ensure a sustainable income to meet rising operational costs and investment needed for renewing railway assets, there is a need to adjust the Airport Express fares to achieve break-even and maintain a high-quality service,” the company said."

China’s plans to put astronauts on the moon by 2030 remain on track with large-scale tests proceeding “as scheduled”, following the completion of early trials for lunar landing spacecraft duo Mengzhou and Lanyue, according to Chinese space authorities.
The current timeline to land the first humans on the moon this century still placed China’s space programme behind the United States.
Component tests that have been completed for the crewed lunar mission include thermal evaluations of the Lanyue lunar lander, which will transport crew members from the spacecraft to the moon’s surface.
The agency was set to conduct the first comprehensive assessments of mission components, Lin said during an event to announce the Shenzhou 20 mission to China’s Tiangong space station, which was expected to launch on Thursday."

China is likely to be among the last countries to reach a trade agreement with the US to reduce tariffs, according to fund manager Franklin Templeton.
It took 18 months to finalise a US-China trade deal during US President Donald Trump’s first term, Yi Ping Liao, a portfolio manager and senior research analyst with the company’s emerging markets equity team, said during an online briefing on Wednesday.
China might “face the highest level of complexity in negotiations, because there are multiple issues aside from trade that need to be resolved”, Liao added, without elaborating on the issues.
On Tuesday, Trump appeared to soften his stance on the escalating tariff war primarily targeting China, saying that in the event of negotiations, levies on China would “come down substantially, but it won’t be zero”.
At a White House event, he said that the current level of 145 per cent was “very high” and that eventual tariffs would not “be anywhere near that high”. A timeline for any change was not made clear.
Trump’s sweeping tariffs on countries around the world have sent global markets tumbling, triggering widespread economic uncertainty.
“I think you can sum up the first 100 days of the Trump 2.0 administration in really one word: uncertainty,” said Grant Bowers, portfolio manager with Franklin Equity Group."

Wong, the highest-ranked player in Hong Kong’s history, lost 7-6, 6-1 to Italy’s Federico Cina in a match that lasted one hour, 18 minutes.
After a tight first set, in which the 373rd-ranked Cina won the tiebreak 7-5, Wong failed to hold his serve in the second and soon fell behind 3-0 before clawing back to 3-1.

The EU on Wednesday slapped Apple and Meta with 700 million euros in fines for breaking digital competition rules, risking the wrath of US President Donald Trump.
The penalties threaten to cause more tension in the already fraught relationship between the bloc and Trump, as the two sides discuss a deal to avoid his sweeping tariffs on the EU.
The European Commission fined Apple 500 million euros (US$570 million) after concluding the company prevented developers from steering customers outside its app store to access cheaper deals.
The EU also fined Meta 200 million euros (US$228 million) over its “pay or consent” system after it violated rules on the use of personal data on Facebook and Instagram.
The fines are the first under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which came into effect last year, forcing the world’s largest tech firms to open up to competition in the EU.
They could rise further if Meta and Apple fail to comply within 60 days, the commission said, threatening the US giants with “periodic penalty payments”."

Chinese autonomous-driving firm Pony.ai said it plans to expand its robotaxi services globally, taking advantage of the lower cost of production enabled by the nation’s leadership in the automotive industry.
James Peng, chairman and CEO of Pony.ai, said the company’s robotaxis were 20 to 30 per cent cheaper than those from US rival Alphabet’s self-driving unit Waymo.
“Our biggest advantage compared with companies like Waymo is that we’re much more integrated,” Peng told the Post during an interview at the Shanghai Auto Show on Wednesday. “We have the advantage of a mature supply chain and ecosystem in China.”
The Guangzhou-based company debuted its seventh-generation autonomous-driving system and showcased three mass production robotaxi models developed in partnership with Japanese auto giant Toyota Motor and state-owned carmakers BAIC Group and GAC on the first day of China’s largest car show.
While the company did not disclose the prices of the new models, it said it had reduced production costs by 70 per cent compared with the previous generation.
“I think in the next two to three years the most significant improvement you’ll see in the industry is the scale-up,” Peng said, adding that falling costs would lead to wider adoption and a significant increase in the number of self-driven taxis on the road."

The eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu, which topped the national economic growth table in the first quarter of this year, is edging closer to Guangdong’s position as the country’s largest provincial economy.
Jiangsu’s quarterly gross domestic product rose 5.9 per cent, year on year, to 3.309 trillion yuan (US$453 billion), narrowing the gap with Guangdong – which has ranked No 1 for over four decades – to around 44 billion yuan, according to data released by the provincial authorities.
Guangdong, which neighbours Hong Kong and Macau and pioneered China’s reform and opening up, saw its economic output grow 4.1 per cent to 3.353 trillion yuan in the same period. Its growth was lower than the national average of 5.3 per cent.
Analysts attributed the southern province’s struggles to its previous overreliance on the property sector, weak consumption, sluggish investment and the impact of trade tensions on exports.
“Guangdong is still undergoing painful economic restructuring, shifting from reliance on real estate to infrastructure and industrial investment. However, the overall economy remains weighed down by debt-ridden property developers,” said David Wong, a lecturer at the Hang Seng University of Hong Kong, who added that made its economic predicament more challenging than that of other developed regions.
Guangdong and Hainan were the only Chinese provinces to see declines in fixed-asset investment in the first quarter, recording falls of 6.2 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively."

China’s leading memory chip manufacturer, ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT), has issued a rare recruitment announcement for its Japanese branch, shedding light on the subsidiary as the company expands its capacity with the aim of becoming a key player in the global dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) market.
In a recruitment post published on Wednesday in Chinese, English and Japanese, CXMT revealed that its Japanese subsidiary, established in 2020 with offices in Yokohama and Fukuoka, is seeking integrated-circuit design candidates who are set to graduate from universities outside China in 2026.
This marks the first time CXMT has disclosed information about its operations in Japan.
CXMT’s DRAM production is expected to reach levels comparable to Micron and about half that of SK Hynix by 2025, potentially reshaping the “three-player structure” of the global DRAM market, according to a recent report by South Korean media outlet ChosunBiz, citing research data from Omdia.
Japan was the dominant force in the memory chip industry during the 1980s, holding an 80 per cent share of the global DRAM market in 1987 and housing seven of the world’s top 10 chipmakers."

Thousands of people filed through the central aisle of St Peter’s Basilica to pay their final respects to Pope Francis on Wednesday, the start of three days of public viewing ahead of the pontiff’s funeral.
Throngs of ordinary faithful made their way slowly to the 16th-century basilica’s main altar, where Francis’ simple wooden casket was perched on a slight ramp, as four Swiss Guards stood at attention. Over the coming days, tens of thousands of people are expected to pass through the basilica, which is staying open until midnight to accommodate them.
Cardinals, meanwhile, met in private to finalise preparations for Saturday’s funeral and plan the conclave to elect Francis’ successor.
Francis died on Monday at age 88, capping a 12-year pontificate characterised by his concern for the poor and message of inclusion, but also some criticism from conservatives who sometimes felt alienated by his progressive bent.
Wednesday opened with the bells of St Peter’s tolling as pallbearers carried Francis’ body from the Vatican hotel where he lived into the basilica in a procession through the same piazza where he had delivered what became his final goodbye. Francis made a surprise Popemobile tour through the faithful on Easter Sunday, after being assured by his nurse he could despite his continued frail health from a bout of pneumonia.
Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who is running the Vatican temporarily until a new pope is elected, led the procession down the central aisle to the altar, with clouds of incense preceding him and the choir chanting the Litany of Saints hymn. In pairs, cardinals in red cassocks approached the casket, bowed and made a sign of the cross, followed by small groups of purple-robbed bishops, black-clad ushers, priests and nuns – and then the doors were thrown open to the public."

Hong Kong lawmakers have proposed increasing the Airport Express’ ridership by improving the service’s connections to the city’s high-speed rail station and a mega bridge, as well as by maintaining cheaper fares to AsiaWorld-Expo.
Lawmaker Gary Zhang Xinyu suggested on a radio programme on Wednesday that links with the two sites would help to increase passenger flows by encouraging people from mainland China to fly from Hong Kong.
His call followed the MTR Corporation’s proposal on Tuesday to raise Airport Express fares for the first time in eight years, with an average increase of 9.4 per cent.
The company said the increase was to ensure “a sustainable income” to meet rising operational costs and investments required to renew railway assets, adding that there was a need to adjust fares to break even and maintain a “high-quality service”.
“We want to make it more convenient for passengers to transfer to the Airport Express from the West Kowloon high-speed rail station, so that we can achieve transfers between railway systems and planes,” Zhang said.
“We hope to attract more friends from mainland provinces to come to Hong Kong using high-speed rail, then transfer to the Airport Express, where they can then fly internationally from Hong Kong.
“We actually have the conditions to do this geographically.”"

Authorities said that the elderly suspect, surnamed Lee, had moved out of the 21-storey public rental building in November after prolonged conflicts with his upstairs neighbours.
In the nearly two years that Lee lived in unit 301, he frequently argued with the people living directly above him in unit 401 over noise issues, according to The Korea Times newspaper.
Police had been called to the building in September after a physical altercation, but no criminal charges were filed. Even after moving out, Lee reportedly continued to visit the complex and argue with his former neighbours.
“He was someone the police should have dealt with, not us,” one resident told The Korea Times.
Lee allegedly returned to set the building on fire on Monday morning, about five months after he had moved out. Witnesses reported a loud explosion and flames coming out of units 401 and 404."

But it saw “strong growth momentum” in cargo operations during the first traditional peak period of the year, recording a year-on-year tonnage increase of 10.6 per cent last month.
“However, the latest developments on trade tariffs are creating uncertainties that may cause disruptions to our cargo business, changes in travel demand, increased costs and pressure on supply chains, among other impacts,” said Lavinia Lau Hoi-zee, who serves as Cathay Pacific’s chief customer and commercial officer.
“We are taking proactive steps to put ourselves in the best possible position in facing and mitigating these external forces as we remain aligned, agile and responsive in our approach.”
Cathay noted that passenger traffic last month was 19.8 per cent higher than in March 2024.
The company also said there had been less demand for leisure travel last month due to the absence of extended weekend breaks in the city."

On a recent Saturday afternoon in downtown Los Angeles, seven friends – plus one dog – contorted and twisted their bodies to fit inside a brown box 2.45 metres (8 feet) tall that had a mirrored door inscribed with the words “Memory Archive”.
Once they were all mostly inside, they looked up towards a Canon digital camera that was peeking out of a small hole.
They posed – smiling brightly and holding the dog in the air – as the shutter clicked eight times. They then stepped out of the booth, selected their favourite shots at a kiosk and waited about a minute for the photos to develop.
The group, most of whom had only met a few hours earlier at a rave, had stumbled upon the photo booth as they were grabbing food at Idyllic cafe, and decided to commemorate the moment. They gushed over the results.

The desert nation hosts the quarter-finals, semi-finals and the final of Asia’s premier club competition – given a new look and format this year as the AFC Champions League Elite – from April 25 to May 3 in Jeddah.
The cash-rich Saudi clubs have lured stars from Europe, meaning Jeddah’s Al-Ahli plus Riyadh clubs Al-Hilal and Al-Nassr are among the favourites to lift the trophy on May 3 at the 62,000-capacity King Abdullah Sports City Stadium.
Saudi teams dominated the West Zone league stages, with Al-Hilal and Al-Ahli both unbeaten in eight games and Ronaldo’s Al-Nassr next best as they filled the top three spots.

The mainland Chinese cities are driving construction growth in the sector, spurred by rising health challenges and an ageing population.
“Beijing, Shanghai, Singapore and Greater Tokyo are the largest life sciences markets in the Asia-Pacific region,” said Paul Peeters, senior director and Asia-Pacific head of life sciences, advisory and transaction services at CBRE.
While China leads the world in construction of such facilities, there is strong growth momentum in the life sciences industry in the region, he added.
Overall, the US leads in terms of existing facilities, with cities such as Boston, San Francisco and San Diego hosting 56 million sq ft, 43.6 million sq ft and 27.3 million sq ft, respectively, according to the report."

A former Hong Kong probationary police inspector has been jailed for 10 weeks for molesting two female officers after a court rejected his assertion that his work equipment could have accidentally brushed the victims.
Fanling Court on Wednesday convicted Tito Yeung Mang-hei of two counts of indecent assault for brushing his hand against the buttocks of the two officers.
The court cleared the 38-year-old defendant of a third count of common assault, ruling that he might have genuinely wished to express gratitude to a third complainant when he massaged her shoulder.
Deputy Magistrate Linda Chan On-ting slammed Yeung for his “utterly disrespectful” conduct towards police officers of the opposite sex, as she declined to impose a non-jail sentence.
“The court must send out a clear message to society that women should be respected and protected at work,” she added.
The court extended Yeung’s bail at the defence’s request to allow him to lodge an appeal at the High Court, on condition that he surrender all travel documents within 24 hours and continue to observe his original bail terms.
The trial heard that Yeung, a father of one, had reverted to working as a paramedic at the Fire Services Department after he was suspended by the police force over the present case."

US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth remained defiant in the face of criticism over his use of a second Signal group text chat to share information linked to an attack on Houthi rebels, blaming people he said were trying to undermine the administration.
“I look at war plans every single day, what was shared over Signal then and now, however you characterise it, was informal, unclassified coordination,” Hegseth said in an interview with Fox News.
Hegseth blamed the news of his use of Signal on leakers within the Pentagon. He said an investigation into leaks is ongoing and evidence would eventually be turned over to the Department of Justice for review.
“Why would it surprise anybody if those very same people keep leaking to the very same reporters whatever information they think they can have to try to sabotage the agenda of the president or the secretary?” he said.
Hegseth – a 44-year-old former Fox News host and National Guard officer – was already under scrutiny for sharing confidential information in a Signal chat group detailing an imminent attack against the Houthis in Yemen. The group included top Trump administration officials as well as journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, who later wrote about the episode.

The Supreme Court, presided over by Justice Oh Seok-jun, upheld a lower-court ruling on Tuesday, sentencing Yeom (full name withheld) to 16 years in prison and a fine of 5 million won (US$3,700) for violations of the Narcotics Control Act and quasi-rape.
Yeom was indicted for illegally prescribing and administering a variety of controlled substances, including propofol, midazolam and ketamine, to Shin, the Rolls-Royce driver who in August 2023 fatally struck a pedestrian near Apgujeong Station in Seoul while under the influence of drugs.
The court concluded that the drugs were not used for medical purposes. In addition to the drug charges, Yeom was also convicted of repeatedly raping more than 10 female patients while they were under sedation and illegally filming their bodies hundreds of times without consent.
The Seoul Central District Court initially sentenced Yeom to 17 years in prison and a 5 million won fine in June last year. The court emphasised the gravity of his crimes, saying: “One cannot overlook the moral collapse of a medical professional entrusted with the highest ethical standards.”
The Seoul High Court later reduced his sentence by one year in January 2024, citing Yeom’s partial admission of guilt and a 76 million won deposit he made as part of restitution efforts."

“To harness this, we must prepare our youth to be multilingual, adaptable and culturally competent,” Fadhlina said at an Asean education summit in Penang.

China will allow certain products traded on the Shanghai Gold Exchange to be delivered overseas by establishing storage facilities in other countries – part of a broader effort to promote the yuan and reduce reliance on the US dollar and US financial systems, according to top regulatory agencies.
In an action plan aimed at enhancing Shanghai’s cross-border financial services to support outbound investment and the Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese regulators said key financial platforms would be strengthened to better allocate global financial resources and enable deeper international investor participation in China’s markets.
“We will support the Shanghai Gold Exchange and other institutions in cooperating with overseas exchanges through product licensing, and expand the use of renminbi-denominated benchmark prices in major international markets,” according to a statement released on Monday by the People’s Bank of China, the National Administration of Financial Regulation, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the Shanghai Municipal People’s Government.
“We will explore the internationalisation of physical delivery for specific products [traded] on the Shanghai Gold Exchange by establishing offshore delivery and storage facilities.”
The action plan, which covers 18 key measures aimed at boosting Chinese businesses’ global competitiveness through enhanced cross-border financial services, includes support for increasing the use of the yuan, foreign currency exchange services, and reinsurance coverage for the Belt and Road Initiative.
In 2024, Shanghai’s total cross-border receipts and payments in yuan reached 29.8 trillion yuan (US$4.1 trillion), a 30 per cent year-on-year increase, making an important milestone in the integration of China’s financial system into the global market, Lu Lei, deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China, said at a briefing on Wednesday afternoon."

There are currently 200 Indonesians studying agriculture at the Arava International Centre for Agricultural Training (AICAT) in Israel’s southern Negev desert, according to a report published last week by Albalad.co, an Indonesian news outlet focused on Middle East affairs. The report, citing an anonymous source, said the figure was a sharp increase from last year’s intake of “around 90” students.
Established in 1994, AICAT offers an 11-month diploma course in advanced and sustainable farming practices tailored to arid climates. Its website lists more than 20,000 alumni from Asian and African countries, including Cabo Verde, formerly known as Cape Verde, Cambodia, Thailand and East Timor.
Cooperation with Indonesia began in 2014, according to AICAT, which noted that since Israel had no diplomatic presence in the Southeast Asian country, student visas were processed through the Israeli embassy in Singapore.
In addition to AICAT, Indonesian students have also enrolled at other Israeli institutions, including Technion and Tel Aviv University. In 2022, the International University of Papua – then just formed – signed a memorandum of understanding with Israel’s Ariel University to establish cultural and educational cooperation. According to a statement on Ariel’s website, it was the “first academic accord between Indonesia and Israel”."

Liu Guoliang resigned as president of the Chinese Table Tennis Association (CTTA) on Wednesday, saying he was stepping down to leave his replacement enough time to guide the nation’s preparations for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.
Less than nine months after China swept the table tennis gold medals in Paris, the 49-year-old handed the baton to his vice-president Wang Liqin, a two-time Olympic champion who had climbed the ladder as a sports official in Shanghai since his retirement from playing in 2014.
There was a nod to the future, too, as six-time Olympic champion Ma Long was elected a vice-president of the CTTA at the congress on Wednesday.
Liu cited a smooth transition for the association and an intention to spend more time with his family as reasons for stepping down.
“I resigned at the right time to leave the new CTTA leadership a full cycle of preparations for the Los Angeles Olympic Games,” Liu said. “Now I am considering spending more time with my family.”
One of 11 players to have completed a grand slam – having won singles titles at the Olympics, World Championships and World Cup – Liu became head coach of China’s men’s national team at 27 in 2003.

The White House’s latest signs of easing its position on tariffs against China do not indicate a notable advancement in US-China trade talks, but may present Beijing an opportunity to get a better deal, economists said.
US President Donald Trump appeared to soften his stance on the US-China trade war on Tuesday, telling an Oval Office press conference that tariffs on Chinese goods “will not be as high as 145 per cent” and that “it’ll come down substantially, but won’t be zero”.
His latest remarks follow claims he made last week that “top officials” from Beijing were talking with their Washington counterparts, and that a trade deal between the world’s two largest economies would soon be agreed.
Chen Zhiwu, a chair professor of finance at the University of Hong Kong, said the comments were “typical Trump” and “nothing unusual”.
“In reality, there hasn’t been any substantial progress or change in the US-China tariff negotiations. But this is [Trump’s] way of signalling to China,” Chen said.
“The more he talks like this, the more it shows how anxious the US side is. Trump and his team are under pressure, but China isn’t showing any signs of impatience.”"

“While it awarded nominal damages to the plaintiff, investors’ losses remain deep,” Chang Li, China country specialist for corporate ratings, said in a report on Tuesday. “The PUFG case was an important test of the structure’s ability to address offshore investors’ subordination risk in a default. So far, it has come up short.”
Keepwell bonds were popular with Chinese companies seeking to issue dollar-denominated bonds through their offshore entities before 2017, bypassing state currency regulators. In providing such deeds, the onshore parent pledged to keep the issuing vehicle solvent by at least US$1 to make good on all its obligations.
The issuance fell to about US$7 billion in 2024 from about US$30 billion in 2017, S&P said, bringing the outstanding Chinese keepwell-backed bonds in the market to US$62 billion."

The US has “brought disgrace upon itself” and made the world aware of its “despicable and shameless behaviour” after imposing tariffs and sanctions on Hong Kong, according to an article published by Beijing’s top office overseeing the city’s affairs.
In the commentary posted on Tuesday and titled “Too much evil will lead to self-destruction: the malicious acts against Hong Kong have brought disgrace upon the United States”, the office also defended Beijing’s tit-for-tat sanctions against certain US individuals who “acted egregiously” on city-related issues.
The piece outlined Washington’s recent actions, including the imposition of tariffs against mainland China and the city.
It also criticised US sanctions against Hong Kong officials and the reintroduction of a bill that could close the city’s trade offices in the country, saying “the ugly face of tyranny” had been exposed and that such efforts were aimed at creating chaos in the financial hub.
“[These acts] provoked strong indignation among Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots. They have also made the world more aware of [the US] despicable and shameless hypocrisy, and desperate hysteria, which can only backfire and bring disgrace,” the article said.

An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the date of the last four-way contest in a Singapore general election. The correct date is 1992.
Last-minute ministerial switches by the ruling PAP include Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong moving east to Punggol where he will face WP star candidate Harpreet Singh.
The PAP will hold onto Marine Parade-Braddell Heights after the first walkover the city state has seen since 2011.
Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat and Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean confirm they will retire from politics.
A rare four-cornered fight will take place in Tampines GRC.
The PAP made several surprise moves as nominations began at 11am and ended at noon, with Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong making a switch from the northwest to the new group representation constituency (GRC) of Punggol in the northeast.
This move will pit Gan against the WP’s star candidate, senior counsel Harpreet Singh, who leads the team in Punggol, an area bordering the party’s strongholds in the multi-seat constituencies of Sengkang and Aljunied.
Although Marine Parade GRC had been touted as a key battleground, the PAP ultimately sailed through with a walkover, as the opposition did not field any team in the constituency.
But the vote represents more than just a referendum on Wong. It will also serve as a barometer for how effectively his team of fourth-generation – or 4G – leaders has addressed pressing issues such as the rising cost of living, job security and affordable housing."

Turley was called by the US Justice Department to testify as part of a three-week trial aimed at determining what changes Alphabet’s Google must make to its business after a federal judge found last year that the company monopolised the search market.
Judge Amit Mehta is set to decide by August what business practices Google must modify. The Justice Department has asked that Google be forced to divest Chrome.
Currently, OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, has an extension in Google’s Chrome browser available for users to download. But having Chrome be more deeply integrated into OpenAI would allow for a better product, Turley said.

Hong Kong’s first astronaut could start serving on missions as early as next year, the national space agency said on Wednesday.
The China Manned Space Agency picked the Hongkonger in June last year as part of the fourth batch of preparatory astronauts. The local specialist and another one from Macau were among 10 chosen in the latest group of astronauts.
“Since the fourth batch of astronauts joined the team in August 2024, they have carried out a great deal of training according to the plan, for instance, basic space flight theory, psychology, space environment adaptability, etc,” agency deputy director general Lin Xiqiang said at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northwestern mainland China.
“After joining the team, the Hong Kong and Macau astronauts have quickly adapted to the working and living environment, rapidly integrated into the crew and trained very hard.
“Their work is progressing smoothly; they are now carrying out studies and training in professional space technology.
“As payload experts, the Hong Kong and Macau astronauts are expected to carry out their first mission in 2026 at the earliest.”"

Chinese state-backed energy firms and privately controlled gas distributors may have to renegotiate long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) procurement contracts they signed with US providers if the trade war drags on, according to analysts.
Trade flows of US LNG to China have stopped since February 10 when Beijing retaliated against a 10 per cent US tariff on Chinese goods by slapping a 15 per cent duty on the fuel, S&P Global Commodity Insights principal research analyst Li Lunjia said on Tuesday. The tariff on US LNG was subsequently raised to at least 140 per cent on April 12.
“During the first 2018-19 US-China trade war, tariffs on US LNG lasted for 18 months,” she said during a webinar. “Similar to last time, we can expect to see the suspension of US LNG imports and contracting activities for as long as the current tariffs remain in place.”
However, Chinese buyers now held much more contracted US LNG than during the last conflict, when nearly all of it was traded on a short-term basis on the spot market, Li said.
Although the US supplied only 4.4 per cent of China’s total LNG imports in the past three years, during which only 3.8 per cent of US LNG exports went to China, the volumes were intended to grow rapidly in coming years, Li said. Chinese buyers now held 21 long-term procurement contracts with US producers covering 25.6 million tonnes of annual volume, she added.
In the short term, the vast majority of the 5.7 million tonnes expected to be delivered this year to Chinese clients could easily be re-sold to buyers in other markets."

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday Ukraine was ready for talks with Russia “in any format” once a ceasefire is set, while the Financial Times reported President Vladimir Putin had offered to halt Russia’s invasion at the current front lines.
Both sides are trying to demonstrate progress towards ending Russia’s war in Ukraine, now well into its fourth year, after US President Donald Trump said he could walk away from efforts to make peace if there is no breakthrough.
“We are ready to record that after a ceasefire, we are ready to sit down in any format so that there are no dead ends,” Zelensky told reporters in the presidential office in Kyiv.
He stressed that any discussions regarding the terms of a peace deal should only happen once the fighting has stopped and that it would be impossible to agree on everything quickly.
The Ukrainian president said his delegation would have a mandate to discuss a full or partial ceasefire at talks with European and US officials in London on Wednesday in a follow-up to last week’s Paris meeting.
At the same time, the White House said Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff will again travel to Russia later this week to hold talks with Putin."

China’s energy-storage industry is facing a challenging outlook this year due to the escalating US-China trade war and weaker government support, prompting one industry group to caution against price competition.
With exports to its biggest market in the US likely to be hit by higher tariffs, the nation’s producers are projected to trim their capital expenditure by 10 to 20 per cent this year, according to consultancy WaterRock Energy Economics. As a result, annual expansion of battery energy-storage systems (BESS) could shrink to as low as 30 gigawatts (GW) this year from 42GW in 2024, it said.
“We expect BESS prices will continue to fall in the local market this year,” said Zhang Liutong, director at WaterRock. “For exports, the BESS producers will need to cultivate non-US markets.”
BESS are devices that enable energy from renewable sources to be stored and then released when needed. They are crucial in the global transition towards clean energy, with China and the US accounting for a combined 80 per cent of installed capacity in 2024, according to Infolink Consulting.
China’s energy-storage sector is still reeling from a relentless price war after years of overproduction. Overall capacity in the new-type energy-storage sector rose by almost 10 times between 2020 and 2023, the National Energy Administration said last week. Excess supply also led to cutthroat price rivalry, causing average export prices to slump 39 per cent between 2020 and 2024, customs data showed."

The United Nations defines ecotourism as “nature-based forms of tourism in which the main motivation of the tourists is the observation and appreciation of nature as well as the traditional cultures prevailing in natural areas”, generating economic benefits for host communities. Hence, there would be an emphasis on wildlife viewing, along with enhancements of natural habitats and integration with local communities. Right?
Wrong. Even though Shui Hau and Pui O rank among Hong Kong’s top 20 sites for bird diversity, there is nothing about birdwatching in the proposed Lantau “corridor”. Apart from a few proposals such as a treetop walkway in Pui O, the plan seems to largely focus on constructing buildings, piers and car parks to solely benefit humans.
Ideas even include a chairlift and a “luge” – surely not involving ice, but likely hurtling downhill on a sort of sledge on wheels – as well as catering and retail facilities and “quality holiday accommodation”.
Despite the “eco” in its name, the corridor does not evidently involve the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, but is the responsibility of the Civil Engineering and Development Department, which in 2017 established the Sustainable Lantau Office.
In August 2021, the department signed a HK$11 million consultancy agreement for an investigation study for “sustainable leisure and recreation initiatives” in Shek Pik and adjoining areas with Binnies Hong Kong – which on LinkedIn describes itself as “a multidisciplinary engineering consultant” that has “played a significant role in developing tailored infrastructure solutions”."

A back problem has compromised Yang’s training since her return, but she won team bronze medals at this year’s Asian Track and Asian Road Championships.
Over last week’s two Hong Kong International Track Cup (HKITC) legs, Yang claimed a pair of omnium 13th-places, and finished fifth in the Madison, alongside Boey Leung Bo-yee.
“The period away from cycling felt like the longest time of my life,” Yang said. “I felt lost. In the past, I’d always had a target: a National Games or Asian Games. All of a sudden, I had no direction in my life. I wanted to come back and see if I could find a new goal.”
It was while she was riding alone in her home city of Liaoning that Yang realised she had made a mistake after three months away from competitive sport."

As China’s youth express reluctance to have children, and those with one child less than enthusiastic over the prospect of more, one densely populated region in the southern province of Guangdong is bucking the trend – but its reasons for doing so appear difficult or downright impossible to replicate nationwide.
In Chaoshan, in the east of the province, ancestral halls dot villages and lineage is fiercely honoured. Chen Jiahui, a 28-year-old from the region, said many of her older cousins have two or even three children, whether they stayed home or moved elsewhere.
“The idea that more children bring more blessings – and that sons carry on the family name – is still very strong here.”
The country’s most populous and wealthiest province, Guangdong also stands out for its birth rate, which consistently ranks above the national average. The region recorded 1.13 million births in 2024 for a year-on-year increase of 100,000, making it China’s top province for new births for the seventh consecutive year, and the only one to top one million newborns five years in a row. Its birth rate of 8.89 per thousand people is among the highest in the country."

Russell Street in Causeway Bay, one of Hong Kong’s most expensive retail strips, has been witnessing a rapid churn in tenants amid rising rents and lukewarm sales.
The latest casualty of the city’s dour retail scene is Prince Jewellery & Watch, which recently closed its flagship shop after 21 years.
Prince Jewellery’s decision to close its 1,800 sq ft street-level shop at 58 Russell Street and at 69 Percival Street came after the landlord decided to raise the monthly rent to about HK$2 million (US$257,800) from HK$1.1 million, founder and CEO Jimmy Tang Kui-ming said by phone on Tuesday.
Property agents tasked with leasing the space said the landlord wanted to lease the ground floor of 69 Percival Street and the whole of 58 Russell Street for a combined HK$2.21 million. Clover Land Investment, the landlord, is linked to the family of former Executive Council member Maria Tam Wai-chu, according to data from Land Registry.
The closure of the outlet completes Prince Jewellery’s retreat from Causeway Bay, where it once occupied three shops. The firm, which leased the shops in 2004, paid around HK$3 million a month at the peak of the market in 2014, according to property agents.
However, the city’s retail scene has been mired in a downturn since the social unrest in 2019 and the Covid-19 pandemic that followed. As a result, shop rents in the city have taken a massive hit."

We learn that for an Asian actor, getting to play an Asian role was a victory back in those days, as the roles were often taken by white actors wearing make-up.
Kwan was born in Hong Kong in 1939. Her father Kwan Wing-hong was Chinese, an architect with a love for films. Her mother was English, a model and actor, although she left when Kwan was young, and she was raised by a stepmother. It was hard because being Eurasian was an anomaly, she recalls."

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday he would cut back “significantly” the time he devotes to the Trump administration from next month and spend more time running the electric-vehicle maker.
Tesla shares, which had risen 4 per cent in after-hours trading right before an earnings conference call began, spiked to trade up 5.5 per cent on Musk’s comments.
The remarks came as deliveries of Tesla’s ageing line-up of cars have nosedived. Investors have sold off the company’s stock, assailed by doubt about how much time Musk is spending managing the company because of his involvement in the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), where he has led efforts to cut federal jobs.
His actions have incensed some people, leading to protests and vandalism at Tesla showrooms that have been reflected in a drop in brand value and a rise in trade-ins. Sales in California – its largest US market – have fallen sharply. Musk, on the Tuesday conference call with analysts, acknowledged the blowback on the company.
After market close on Tuesday, Tesla reported profitability for its core vehicle business that topped rock-bottom expectations and said it was on track to produce an affordable car, offering some hope to investors as sales have dropped.
But the EV maker said it would have to reassess its growth forecast in three months because it was “difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains”."

US President Donald Trump said Tuesday he has no plans to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, just days after his statement that he would like to terminate the head of the US central bank caused a stock market sell-off.
“I have no intention of firing him,” Trump told reporters.
The US president had previously insinuated otherwise as he said he could fire Powell if he wanted to, having been frustrated by the Fed putting a pause on cuts to short-term interest rates.
Powell has said that Trump’s tariffs are creating uncertainty about slower growth and higher inflationary pressures, while the president maintains that inflationary worries are essentially non-existent.
The president maintains that energy and grocery prices are falling, so the Fed should cut its benchmark rates because inflation is no longer a threat to the US economy, Trump said.
His remarks indicated that he still plans to use the bully pulpit to pressure a US central bank that is committed to resisting political pressure as part of its mandate to stabilise prices and maximise employment."

A US jury concluded on Tuesday that The New York Times did not libel former Alaska governor Sarah Palin for an error in a 2017 editorial that she says damaged her reputation.
The jury deliberated a little over two hours before reaching its verdict after lawyers for Palin and the newspaper delivered closing arguments at a Manhattan federal court civil trial that is in its second week.
Palin testified Monday that death threats against her increased and her spirits drooped after an editorial about gun violence said her political action committee had contributed to political rhetoric that enabled an atmosphere of violence.
The Times corrected the article less than 14 hours after it was published.
Kenneth Turkel, a lawyer for Palin, urged the jury to find the Times liable for defamation on the grounds that its former editorial page editor, James Bennet, either knew what he was publishing was wrong or acted with “reckless disregard” for the truth.
He told the jury it should award Palin compensatory damages for the harm done to her reputation and private mental anguish, adding that they should “find a number and let her get some closure to this thing.”"

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that Chinese citizens were working at a drone production site in Russia and suggested that Moscow may have “stolen” drone technology from China.
The Ukrainian leader made the comment at a news conference in Kyiv days after he said China was supplying weapons and gunpowder to Russia, the first time he has accused Beijing of direct military aid to Moscow, something China staunchly denies.
Ukraine’s foreign ministry said it had summoned Chinese Ambassador Ma Shengkun and expressed Ukraine’s “serious concerns” over Chinese involvement in the war.
Beijing on Wednesday dismissed Ukraine’s allegation as “groundless”.
“China firmly opposes groundless accusations and political manipulation,” foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said at a press conference.
Zelensky, in suggesting that Russia may have obtained drone technology from China without Beijing actually knowing, appeared to be softening his tone towards China, which casts itself as neutral on the war in Ukraine.
The flurry of Ukrainian allegations directed at China, the world’s second-largest economy, in recent days has been particularly striking at a sensitive moment for Kyiv in the US-led diplomatic effort to end Russia’s war in Ukraine."

Israeli police on Tuesday scoured the Mediterranean coast for a swimmer they fear may have been attacked by a shark in an area that has long seen close encounters between marine predators and beachgoers who sometimes seek them out.
A shiver of endangered dusky and sandbar sharks has been swimming close to the area for years, attracting onlookers who approach the sharks, drawing pleas from conservation groups for authorities to separate people from the wild animal.
Nature groups say those warnings went unheeded. Police and rescuers launched a search along the coast after reports that a shark attacked a swimmer on a beach near the city of Hadera.
Israel’s Fire and Rescue Authority announced on Tuesday afternoon they had found remains of a body, which was brought to the forensic institute for identification.
On Tuesday, the beach was closed as search teams used boats and underwater equipment to look for the man. His identity was not immediately known, but Israeli media said he had gone to swim with the sharks.
Israelis flocked in large numbers to the beach during a weeklong holiday, sharing the waters with a dozen or more sharks. Some tugged on the sharks’ fins, while others threw them fish to eat."

“No one thinks the current status quo is sustainable, at 145 and 125 [per cent], so I would posit that over the very near future, there will be a de-escalation,” he said referring to the top end of most of the tariffs that Trump has put on imports from China and vice versa, respectively. “We have an embargo now on both sides.”
“China is going to be a slog in terms of the negotiations, because that engagement started … not yet,” he added. “But I think, again, I think neither side thinks the status quo is sustainable.”

A growing number of Southeast Asian immigrants in Los Angeles and Orange counties whose deportation orders have been on indefinite hold for years are being detained, and in some cases, deported after showing up for routine check-ins at US Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices, according to immigrant lawyers and advocacy groups.
The immigrants being targeted are generally people who were convicted of a crime after arriving in the US, making them eligible for deportation after their release from jail or prison.
In most cases, ICE never followed through with the deportations because the immigrants had lived in the US long enough that their home countries no longer recognised them as citizens, or as is the case with Laos, the home country does not readily issue repatriation documents.
Instead, under long-standing policies, these immigrants have been allowed to remain in the US with the condition that they checked in with ICE agents regularly to show they were working and staying out of trouble. The check-ins generally start out monthly, but over time become an annual visit."

Paris has everything: stunning architecture and arguably the best food and fashion in the world. But the French capital lacks one essential element of a modern metropolis – it has no football rivalry.
Despite Qatar-owned Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) spending vast sums in recent years assembling a team featuring superstars such as Lionel Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, and the club reaching this season’s Champions League semi-finals, the city has never truly been a football crucible.
Yet the Paris region is probably the world’s hottest football talent factory.
Twenty-nine players from the greater Paris area went to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, including 11 members of the France squad that reached the final, with others representing the likes of Portugal, Cameroon, Tunisia, Senegal and Morocco.
But Paris, the biggest urban area in the European Union with a population more than 12 million, has had only one club in France’s top division – PSG – since Racing Paris were relegated 35 years ago.
London has seven clubs in the Premier League, while Madrid, Milan, Rome, Barcelona and Athens all boast multiple top-tier teams."

Hong Kong education authorities have expressed serious concerns over the alleged secret filming of a 13-year-old boy by his classmates during a mainland study tour.
The incident reportedly took place in March of last year while pupils from a Kwai Chung school were on a study tour in Shenzhen, the Post has learned.
Classmates allegedly filmed the boy without clothes while he was showering in a hotel bathroom, with the video circulated among pupils and posted on social media platforms.
The boy’s parents filed a report to police last year. But they reportedly got back in contact with the force recently after discovering that related images had been uploaded to social media.
According to media reports, police received the complaint in March last year and the case was handled by a Kwai Tsing district investigation team.
Following an investigation, a 14-year-old boy was reportedly arrested the following month on April 15 on suspicion of unlawful recording or observation of intimate parts."

Three people have been arrested for allegedly attempting to open a bank account in Hong Kong and depositing nearly 2,000 counterfeit bonds, each with a face value of HK$500 million (US$64 million).
The suspects, two men and a woman aged between 65 and 75, were arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of using false instruments. They are currently in custody.
The trio entered a Standard Chartered branch on Nathan Road near Shantung Street in Mong Kok at around 11am on Tuesday to open an account, police said.
They presented 1,999 counterfeit bonds, each marked with a face value of HK$500 million, prompting bank staff to alert police.
A 72-year-old mainland Chinese man, who also held a Hong Kong identity card, was found to be in possession of the fake bonds. His companions, a 75-year-old man and a 65-year-old woman, both two-way permit holders from the mainland, were also detained.

This story has been updated to reflect that Tim Huxley said: “We can all sort of live with that decline in US trade. There is absolutely no prospect of Donald Trump driving me or my business out of Hong Kong. This is the best place in the world to run a shipping business.”
Steep port fees imposed on Chinese vessels docking in the US are not expected to immediately affect Hong Kong’s shipping sector as the industry is good at working around disruptions and may benefit from the move, veteran shippers have said.
Shipping industry players gathered on Tuesday to address how Hong Kong’s maritime community will face the challenges and seize opportunities such volatility brings.
Among them was Olivia Lennox-King, chief operating officer at Cetus Maritime, which operates more than 40 bulk carriers. She addressed the decision by the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) to introduce a phased fee structure targeting Chinese vessel operators, owners and ships built in China.
“Very disruptive events can cause inefficiencies in shipping trades, which then increases rates, which is not necessarily, if you’re not in shipping, what you would expect to happen in the shipping industry,” she said at a lunch hosted by the Foreign Correspondents’ Club.
“Shipping is great at responding and finding new ways to work around disruptions.
“Shipping is very dynamic. There will be new developments based on what is happening in the US.”"

Nearly 100 days in, Donald Trump’s second term as US president has been defined by his determination to upend the established order on nearly all fronts of domestic and foreign policy, with dire consequences for global economic and cultural engagement. In the first of this series, we look at the extent to which the president’s actions have stirred up a viable opposition that includes voters from his own party.
In deep-red Iowa, long-time US Senator Chuck Grassley was met with boos and groans as frustrated constituents grilled him on US President Donald Trump’s erratic tariffs, hardline immigration policies and sweeping budget cuts last week.
“We’d like to know what you, as Congress – who are supposed to rein in this dictator – are going to do about it?” one man yelled, drawing loud applause from the packed crowd in Fort Madison’s city hall.
In Georgia, US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s town hall in her similarly solidly Republican district spiralled into chaos, with several attendees tased and arrested for shouting interruptions as she promoted Trump’s agenda.
Last month, Republican lawmakers in Texas and Kansas faced chants of “vote you out” at their town halls, while in Arizona, Senators Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego, both Democrats, were urged by constituents to “fight dirtier” and “get in the mud” with Republicans.
Scenes like these – where public anger over Trump’s policies erupts into confrontations with US lawmakers – have played out across the country in recent weeks."

UN experts will assess Hong Kong’s disaster rescue team next year as part of its bid to attain international accreditation to recognise its abilities, with the squad commander saying he is confident about the group’s chances of passing the evaluation.
Cheu Yu-kok, commander of the team that was deployed to earthquake-stricken Myanmar last month, said on Tuesday that the group had already completed up to four drills and gathered advice from mainland Chinese counterparts to prepare for the assessment.
“Our progress has been good so far, we are also confident that we can pass the evaluation to become an accredited international search and rescue team next year,” Cheu said.
The group applied for an accreditation as a medium-sized rescue team with the International Search and Rescue Advisory Group in November 2023, after the department led a 49-strong team to conduct a nine-day rescue operation in Turkey’s earthquake.
The advisory group is a United Nations-endorsed body that coordinates global rescue missions and develops search and rescue standards. Its accreditations are split into “light”, “medium” and “heavy” teams, with varying manpower and capability requirements.
A medium team is able to sustain 24-hour operations at a site for up to seven days and can perform searches with dogs, rigging and lifting. The team is also able to cut structural steel."

China has released an action plan to promote the use of the yuan and its own payment system in international trade, as it seeks to reduce its dependence on the dollar amid an escalating trade war with the United States.
The plan – jointly released by the Shanghai municipal government, the People’s Bank of China and the country’s financial regulators on Monday – aims to leverage Shanghai’s role as a global financial hub to promote the use of the Chinese currency, especially in trade involving countries in the Global South.
It will also strengthen financial support for Chinese enterprises “going global” and advance the Belt and Road Initiative, while “enabling all types of market players to engage in international competition and cooperation in a safer, more convenient and efficient manner”, according to an official statement.
Settling more transactions using China’s own currency and payment system would enable Beijing to strengthen its position in global trade networks and reduce the harm caused by any potential US move to curtail its access to the dollar-based financial system."

The 22-year-old Briton pulled out of the Billie Jean King Cup qualifiers to rest following a run to the quarter-finals in Miami, where she needed medical attention during her defeat by eventual runner-up Jessica Pegula.
Having opted for a training block instead, Raducanu is raring to go in the Spanish capital where she kicks off her campaign against Dutchwoman Suzan Lamens on Wednesday.
“I’ve realised now that less is more for me sometimes,” Raducanu told Sky Sports. “I work really intense and really hard, and can definitely be partial to overkilling it sometimes.
“It’s just making sure when I’m on the court I’m maxing out for X amount of time so I can focus, and then once I’m done, I’m switching off better.
“You hear a lot that people need matches and I say the same thing. Matches definitely help, but there’s a time and a place. There are other times where you need to reset and get your bearings, because the season is very long.”"

Hong Kong’s forests can store more than 7 million tonnes of carbon, equivalent to one-fifth of the city’s annual emissions, according to estimates in a first-of-its-kind local study.
The research, which looked at more than 100 native tree species, also found those with the best potential to capture the greenhouse gas, providing data for authorities and private developers when assessing the carbon footprint of their projects.
Coinciding with Earth Day on Tuesday, the Conservancy Association released the findings of a three-year study on the carbon storage capacity of more than 100 trees native to Hong Kong.
The group’s conservation manager, Dr Angie Ng Ying-sim, said the study could provide more data to assess the effects of green investments for the city’s development, such as projects involving reforestation and forest protection and management for carbon dioxide removal.
Ng said Hong Kong had immense potential to create a carbon sink – a natural area which absorbs more carbon than it produces – which could be a nature-based solution to the government’s goal for the city to be carbon neutral by 2050.
Woodlands make up a quarter of the city’s 111,900 hectares (276,500 acres) of land, while grassland and shrubland form another third. The effects of a carbon sink can be maximised by planting species that can store more carbon."

Russian drones battered the Ukrainian port city of Odesa and glide bombs hit Zaporizhzhia, local authorities said on Tuesday, as the Kremlin again warned that negotiators are unlikely to obtain a swift breakthrough in peace talks on the war.
Ukrainian, British, French and US officials are due to meet in London on Wednesday to discuss the war. Anticipation is building over whether diplomatic efforts can stop more than three years of fighting since Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbour. Hostility has run deep since Russia invaded and illegally annexed Ukraine’s Crimea Peninsula in 2014.
US President Donald Trump said last week that negotiations were “coming to a head” and insisted that neither side was “playing” him in his push to end the war. That came after Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested the US might soon back away from negotiations if they do not progress.
Rubio suggested that Wednesday’s meeting could be decisive in determining whether the Trump administration continues its involvement.
But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov cautioned that “the settlement issue is so complex that it would be wrong to put some tight limits on it and try to set some short time frame for a settlement, a viable settlement – it would be a thankless task”.
Western analysts say Moscow is in no rush to conclude peace talks because it has battlefield momentum and wants to capture more Ukrainian land."

As the United States continues to tighten restrictions on chip exports to China in a bid to curb the country’s access to advanced semiconductors, Chinese researchers have gone into overdrive.

Huawei Technologies will roll out its new Ascend 920 artificial intelligence (AI) chip later this year, as the company steps into the role as China’s alternative supplier to US giant Nvidia, which is subject to even tighter US export restrictions, according to media reports and industry insiders.
The Ascend 920, which was at the advanced 6-nanometre node level, is expected to begin mass production in the second half of this year, with analysts saying it could become an alternative to Nvidia’s H20 AI chips that were just banned from sale to China, according to a report by Taiwanese media Digitimes.
A representative from Huawei on Tuesday denied rumors that the company had unveiled the Ascend 920 chips at its annual cloud ecosystem conference in early April, and did not comment on the mass production plan.
Separately, Huawei’s Ascend 910C graphics processing unit (GPU), part of its Ascend 910 series, will go into mass production as early as next month, according to a Reuters report on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Nvidia began selling its tailor-made H20 chips to the Chinese market in early 2024, after its advanced A100, H100, A800 and H800 AI chips were all placed under US export controls due to national security concerns."

“The downward revision is a result of greater policy uncertainty, trade tensions and a softer demand outlook, given slower-than-anticipated consumption growth,” the IMF said in the report.

Hong Kong Customs and a consumer watchdog are investigating 22 complaints involving HK$200,000 (US$26,000) in prepaid packages following the abrupt closure of a beauty centre in Fanling, a lawmaker assisting victims has said.
Athena Beauty, located in Cheung Wah Estate in Fanling, was also accused of transferring customers’ information without consent to Classic Life, a beauty salon in Tai Po, which allegedly claimed to honour the prepayments and then employed high-pressure sales tactics.
Lawmaker Edward Lau Kwok-fan on Tuesday said that his team had received at least 22 complaints involving over HK$200,000 in prepaid packages since the beauty centre abruptly closed on March 16. Individual victims reported losses ranging between HK$10,000 and HK$20,000.
During a press conference with three victims, Lau estimated that more than 100 people, primarily elderly women, had been affected.
“Athena Beauty informed customers of its closure due to lease issues via WhatsApp messages on the day when it folded. But in the week leading up to the closure, it was still persuading customers to purchase treatment packages,” Lau said.
“Some customers later found out that Athena Beauty had not disclosed having a branch in Ma On Shan. Instead, the company transferred their personal information and remaining prepaid packages to Classic Life. This is a separate company that employed high-pressure sales tactics when customers attempted to redeem their treatments.”
A victim, who only identified herself as Apple, 55, said she tried to use her package bought from Athena Beauty at Classic Life, which later imposed harsh conditions, including unreasonably expensive new treatment prepaid plans."

The pre-recorded speech covered a wide range of issues and reiterated many of Beijing’s official lines about Hong Kong’s security. Xia also condemned the US tariffs on Hong Kong, claiming they were not just about trade but aimed at taking away the city’s life itself.
“Despite Hong Kong being the largest source of the US trade surplus, the United States still imposed high tariffs on it. This is extremely arrogant and shameless,” Xia said in the keynote speech at a ceremony marking the city’s 10th National Security Education Day.
“The US isn’t after [Hong Kong’s] tariffs, it is after our very survival.”
While it was not surprising that Xia lambasted the US, his tone was harsher than ever before.
Some observers said it was a war cry aimed at rallying Hong Kong officials and the business sector to fight alongside Beijing in the trade war with the US."

Washington’s scaled-down port-fee plan has reduced the pressure on China’s shipyards while increasing the burden faced by major shipping carriers, analysts said.
For Chinese shipyards, the most significant change is the scrapping of a previous plan to charge fees to shipping companies based on how many Chinese-made vessels they had in their fleets and the number of orders they had placed with Chinese shipbuilders.
That earlier rule meant companies would have faced charges even when one of their non-Chinese-built vessels entered a US port, placing them under greater pressure not to buy from Chinese shipbuilders.
The removal of that clause “is a big relief for Chinese shipbuilders, as it significantly alleviates clients’ concerns about placing orders”, said a senior analyst at a state-owned Chinese shipping company, who requested anonymity due to company policies on speaking with the media."

India and the United States have agreed on a road map for a trade deal in a move that is expected to defuse tensions over looming tariffs and reposition New Delhi as a key partner in Washington’s strategy to counter China’s influence.
The announcement came hours after US Vice-President JD Vance met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Monday.
In a statement, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer confirmed both sides had finalised the terms of reference for negotiations aimed at achieving “reciprocal trade”.
“There is a serious lack of reciprocity in the trade relationship with India. These ongoing talks will help achieve balance and reciprocity by opening new markets for American goods and addressing unfair practices that harm American workers,” he said.
“India’s constructive engagement so far has been welcomed, and I look forward to creating new opportunities for workers, farmers, and entrepreneurs in both countries,” Greer added.
India’s external affairs ministry said in a statement that Modi and Vance noted “significant progress” in bilateral trade negotiations. Vance said in a post on X that he “looked forward to strengthening our relationship with India”."

Urgent problems created in the wake of the conflict are expected to be at the top of the Politburo’s agenda, they said, alongside expectations for further monetary easing in the second quarter.
“It’s still too early to announce the kind of large-scale stimulus some in the market are hoping for … as the first-quarter data was decent, and a lot could happen in the second quarter,” said Ding Shuang, chief Greater China economist at Standard Chartered Bank.

Chairman Lo Kin-hei on Tuesday also said on a talk show hosted by former party chairwoman and ex-legislator Emily Lau Wai-hing that the organisation had been forced to dissolve, driven by factors that “upset the balance” of considerations for it to continue its work.
“Originally, if circumstances had remained unchanged, the balance of factors of whether we would continue or not was quite stable. We thought we could keep hanging on. But we eventually found out that the situation had changed, disrupting the balance,” Lo said, without elaborating on what the changes were.
“So we either choose not to make any decisions or we follow through with our decision [to disband]. On the question of whether there is any room for us to reconsider disbanding, I don’t think so.”
Lo said on Tuesday that once the central committee had made its decision, the group would not try to stall the process and in fact aimed to expedite the party’s dissolution."

“Do you think I can manage it?” he had asked Strappetti before taking the plunge.
The nurse, in whom he had complete confidence, reassured him.
Francis then spent about 15 minutes waving at the crowd and blessing babies from his Popemobile, flanked by numerous bodyguards."

John Singer Sargent (1856-1925) is justifiably known for his renditions of beautiful belle époque socialites.
“To have been painted by [Sargent] added distinction to the most distinguished,” wrote one critic in a 1925 obituary.
But before he became the hottest portrait painter in France – and eventually the UK and the US – Sargent had to establish himself as both a member of the cultural elite and a painter of unmatched talent.
The only place to do that, in his mind at least, was the Paris Salon. When Sargent first arrived in Paris, he was an ambitious unknown.

Herdrich explains that Sargent quickly figured out how to make his work stand out at the Paris Salon, the juried forum where thousands of artists – both unknown and famous – would hang new work."

It comes after Egypt confirmed it was using the Chinese HQ-9B long-range surface-to-air missile system earlier this month.
An advanced radar aircraft, the KJ-500 has sophisticated electronic warfare systems and secure data link capabilities. Its radar dome provides 360-degree coverage and it can detect and track airborne and surface targets at an extended range.
Sun Degang, director of the Centre for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, said the KJ-500’s flight over the Red Sea marked “a significant step in China’s military modernisation” and showed how it could be used for strategic airlift operations and force projection.
“China now possesses not only near-seas defence capabilities but also the capacity to conduct long-range escort missions and consular protection operations,” Sun said, referring to the presence of the KJ-500 in a strategically sensitive area."

A Hong Kong father, previously sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his three-year-old daughter by shaking her to death in 2020, has filed an appeal against his conviction.
A document made available at the High Court on Tuesday revealed that Lau Kai-ping, 42, had submitted an appeal against his conviction for one count of murder.
The jury in March unanimously found him guilty of killing Leung Nga-sze in July 2020 in their Sham Shui Po flat.
During the month-long trial, the court heard that Lau told paramedics who arrived at the scene that the girl had “slipped”.
However, hospital doctors discovered signs of bleeding beneath the girl’s skull and in her retinas, along with old bruises on her inner thighs. The unusual injuries led them to suspect child abuse.
The girl died on July 29. Medical experts had concluded Nga-sze’s injuries were highly characteristic of shaken baby syndrome, which results from violently shaking a child."

Hong Kong’s box office revenue during the Easter holiday shrank by 65 per cent compared with the same period last year, prompting a firm that tracks cinema bookings to call for more public support given the difficult operating environment.
Revenue from film screenings in Hong Kong and Macau across four days from last Friday to Monday stood at HK$13.5 million (US$1.7 million), 65 per cent less than the HK$38.4 million generated during the same period in 2024.
“This shows that the operating environment of Hong Kong cinemas continues to be difficult,” Hong Kong Box Office, a firm that tracks cinema bookings, said on Tuesday.
“We hope residents who like movies will … continue to support cinemas and the Hong Kong film industry.”
A Minecraft Movie, a Hollywood film, topped the box office chart, generating HK$3.1 million over the four days. Flow, which won the Oscar for best animated feature, came second, earning HK$1.4 million.

China’s Ministry of Education has fast-tracked approvals for 29 new university major courses in an effort to address the country’s “most urgent strategic needs” as it tries to develop the talent to compete with the United States.
The ministry’s announcement on Tuesday comes as the nation faces stiff American tariffs on its exports and strict sanctions on critical technologies like advanced semiconductors, forcing the country to seek technological self-reliance and new growth sectors to revitalise its stalled economy.
In announcing its latest list of undergraduate majors of Chinese tertiary education institutions this year, the ministry said this was the first time it had activated the “extraordinary mechanism” to greenlight the courses.
“They are for the strategic areas that the central government has recently identified and paid close attention to,” the ministry said.
Universities must normally submit applications for new disciplines one year in advance. But this year, the ministry was allowed to authorise late applications, as well as encourage several universities to implement important new majors, according to the statement.

Vietnam is targeting ordinary social media users for posts criticising the state in an expanding crackdown on dissent, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Tuesday.
Vietnam, a one-party state, has long sentenced bloggers and human rights activists to hefty jail terms, but now even those with no appreciable public profiles risk arrest if they voice a grievance against communist party officials, HRW said in a report.
Members of the public were being targeted through an expansion of the scope of article 331 of the penal code, which centred on the “infringement of state interests”, the report said.
Between 2018 and February 2025, Vietnamese courts convicted and sentenced at least 124 people to harsh prison terms under article 331, according to HRW.
In the six years to 2017, only 28 were sentenced under equivalent laws, the report said.
Vietnamese authorities “abuse the law not only to silence prominent activists and whistle-blowers, but to retaliate against ordinary people who complain about poor services or police abuse,” said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at Human Rights Watch."

The death of Pope Francis has prompted an outpouring of grief in Indonesia, where Catholics and non-Catholics alike remember the late pontiff’s message of compassion, humility and interfaith unity in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation.
The 88-year-old head of the Catholic Church, who died on Monday of a stroke and subsequent heart failure, had been warmly received during a landmark visit to Indonesia in September last year – the first papal visit in more than three decades.
Father James Damanik, a priest at the Immaculate Conception of Mary Cathedral in the city of Medan in Indonesia, told This Week in Asia that the pope’s popularity in the country had been demonstrated by the outpouring of support on Indonesian social media that he had seen following the news of the pope’s passing.
“Everyone was posting about it on their status and stories. Every time people talked about him, they were so warm,” he said. “Even though Indonesia is a Muslim-majority nation and people think that Indonesia is anti-Christian, it was on all the news channels. Of course, we were very sad.”
Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto, who is Muslim, shared in a post on X: “With the deepest sorrow, I learned the news of the passing of His Holiness Pope Francis. The world has lost a remarkable figure whose unwavering commitment to peace, humanity, and fraternity inspired many.”"

But erratic tariff policies from US President Donald Trump this year have added to the uncertainties of any long-term investment plans, according to industry insiders.
On Monday, the US Department of Commerce announced its final affirmative determinations in the year-long anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations on solar cells and modules from four countries in Southeast Asia, with rates broadly higher than the preliminary levels announced last year.
Manufacturers such as Zhejiang-based Hounen Solar would face combined dumping and countervailing duties of more than 3,500 per cent for products made in Cambodia, according to the announcement.
Combined duties on some Chinese companies’ factories in Thailand would be near 1,000 per cent. Some Vietnam-based plants would see tariffs exceed 800 per cent. And some in Malaysia would also face levies as high as 250 per cent.
Southeast Asia has become a major destination for Chinese solar firms transferring production capacity overseas in recent years – seen as an attempt to bypass US tariffs on direct imports from China."

The four-time Group One winner was restricted to light work in the quarantine trotting ring from last Friday to Monday after undergoing treatment for lameness in his left hind leg.
Bronte Forbes, the Jockey Club’s Head of the Department of Veterinary Regulation, Welfare and Biosecurity, inspected El Vencedor on Monday and cleared him to complete trackwork on Tuesday morning.
The six-year-old did some light work on the all-weather track, pleasing his handler ahead of his tilt at Sunday’s HK$28 million feature.

“Very happy with him,” Marsh said after watching El Vencedor’s work on Tuesday.
“He just had a little minor abscess in a hind foot, but he’s been working in the quarantine sand and he’s out on the track today moving beautifully and freely.
“It took a bit to get past the big screens – I don’t think he’d seen himself on a big screen before, but he’s great. He’ll gallop on Thursday, Zac [Purton] will ride him on the turf and I think we’re right on track.”
El Vencedor brings career-best form to Hong Kong with four consecutive wins, including three at Group One level – the Herbie Dyke Stakes (2,000m), Otaki-Maori WFA Classic (1,600m) and Bonecrusher New Zealand Stakes (2,000m).

While he faces a tough task against fellow internationals such as French star Goliath and Japan’s Liberty Island and Prognosis, El Vencedor has the advantage of being ridden by seven-time champion Hong Kong jockey Zac Purton.
“He’s the King of Hong Kong, you’d say, and it’s brilliant to have him on,” Marsh said of Purton.
“One of the owners’ friends is good friends with Zac, so they got in touch with him early on and he was more than happy to take the ride a fair way out.
“He’d done the form on the horse and felt he might be the right kind of horse to ride, so it’s great when he’s got confidence in you.”
Chasing his second QE II Cup success after booting home Exultant in 2020, Purton is optimistic El Vencedor can bring his hot form to Hong Kong.
“He’s been racing really well, very consistently at a high level going left and right-handed and he can handle different types of ground, so he’s versatile,” Purton said.
“Hopefully he can draw a nice gate and roll forward and if he has to lead, he leads. If something else wants to go, he’s able to take a sit. It’s nice to pick him up, I’m happy to be on him and to give him a chance.”
El Vencedor will be the first international runner for 44-year-old Marsh, who has prepared more than 1,000 winners and is the son of Bruce Marsh, a Melbourne Cup-winning jockey and successful Singapore-based trainer."

Referring to then-Workers’ Party (WP) chief Low Thia Khiang, Lee said: “The problem is he cannot find capable people to match the PAP. That’s the nub of it all.”
Weeks later at the 50th anniversary dinner of the Foreign Correspondents Association, Lee, who stepped down as prime minister in 1990, famously said: “I want a first-class; a world-class opposition. Not this riff-raff.”
Four elections and less than two decades later, the gap between the credentials of the opposition candidates and the ruling PAP appears to have narrowed considerably, but voters have come to expect more than the qualifications of their would-be members of parliament, according to political analysts who spoke to This Week in Asia.
While the PAP has ruled without interruption in Singapore since before the city state’s independence in 1965, the opposition’s presence has been growing in recent elections. Since 2015, the opposition has made a bid for every seat in every election.
In the 2011 election, Low’s WP won its first multi-ward constituency in Aljunied. In the election in 2020, the opposition party clinched a second multi-seat constituency in Sengkang, expanding its reach in the northeast of Singapore and earning it a record 10 of the 93 seats in parliament.

Hong Kong’s anti-corruption agency has charged an airport expansion project subcontractor for allegedly exploiting 21 imported workers by collecting part of their salaries worth more than HK$1 million (US$128,850).
The Independent Commission Against Corruption on Tuesday laid a charge of “conspiracy for an agent to accept advantages” against Chan Sin-tai, director and shareholder of Full Spirit Marble Factory.
According to the agency, Chan’s company was involved in recruiting mainland Chinese workers while Gammon Construction, the main contractor of the airport terminal two expansion project, applied for imported labour for its subcontractors.
The main contractor would pay the workers HK$29,700 for 22 days of labour every month, with a daily rate of HK$1,350.
The commission alleged that Chan told the imported workers through their team leader that they only earned between HK$780 and HK$1,150 daily.
“He requested they return the difference between the daily wage according to the contract and the actual daily wage to Full Spirit, totalling over HK$1 million,” the commission said.
Between January and October last year, Chan was suspected to have conspired with a team leader of imported workers to accept bribes from 21 people to secure employment."

Hong Kong’s Juninho has predicted that Manchester United will bring the city to a standstill when they arrive for a friendly match next month.
The forward could line up against the English giants for the city’s representative team at Hong Kong Stadium on May 30, and he is relishing an occasion he believes will boost the game locally.
United were fresh from winning the last of their 20 English league titles when they last came to the city in 2013. They won 5-2 against Kitchee, for whom Juninho now plays, as they began an uncertain chapter under new manager David Moyes following Alex Ferguson’s retirement after 27 years in charge.
Current boss Ruben Amorim is the latest to struggle to follow Ferguson’s success, and one Hong Kong player this month told the Post he believed the shortage of A-list stars in the United team would remove some shine from the fixture.
But Juninho, who has 15 caps, said: “This will be such a great experience for us … this event will stop Hong Kong.
“All eyes will be on the game. It will be very good for Hong Kong football, and I hope it helps us to keep growing the football community.”"

Hongkongers who leave public hospital accident and emergency (A&E) departments before being treated will be offered a refund of about 88 per cent of the standard charge, instead of the current full reimbursement, starting from next year under the government’s healthcare subsidy reform.
Commissioner for Primary Healthcare Dr Pang Fei-chau also said on Tuesday that the refund policy would be standardised to cover all days.
“If the resident seeking medical attention chooses to visit another healthcare institution while waiting at the A&E department, they can apply for a refund,” he wrote in a local newspaper.
“When the A&E charge is adjusted to HK$400 (US$52) from January 1, 2026, the refund amount will be HK$350.”
He added the government would compile information on the consultation hours and locations of primary healthcare doctors in the community. This information would be accessible to the public through platforms such as the official electronic health record platform, eHealth.
Previously, special full refunds at A&E departments were implemented during long holidays to alleviate overcrowding and reduce the strain on public hospitals. Residents could receive a full refund by submitting an application."

Chinese investors have been flocking to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the price of gold, hoping to take advantage of the precious metal’s world-beating rally as stocks remain in the doldrums amid a tariff war.
The 13 mainland-domiciled gold ETFs have attracted new subscriptions of at least 7.9 billion units so far this year, according to financial data provider Wind Information. As of April 11, fresh inflows and the rising price of gold added 70.4 billion yuan (US$9.6 billion) to the funds’ assets under management, an 80 per cent year-on-year rise, according to data compiled by Guosen Securities.
Gold’s 33 per cent gain this year has beaten other key asset classes, with global investors loading up on the metal to hedge against rising geopolitical tensions. The pattern has strengthened since the US rattled global financial markets and upended global trade with its so-called reciprocal tariffs early this month. Goldman Sachs expects gold to hit US$4,000 an ounce at some point this year, implying a 15 per cent rise from the current level.
“Gold is shining on the backdrop of reshaping the global order,” said Liu Shiyao, an analyst at Zijin Tianfeng Futures. “The more than 60 per cent gain in gold prices over the past two years shows that it has come to take the place of US Treasuries and the dollar as the haven for investors.”
Spot gold prices rose 1.7 per cent to US$3,480.54 an ounce on Tuesday after topping US$3,400 for the first time in overnight trading. Investors snapped up the metal after US President Donald Trump’s comments on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy undermined confidence in the independence of the world’s biggest central bank and lent more weight to the narrative of steering clear of US assets.
Money managers had 126.7 billion yuan of assets under management in gold ETFs as of April 11, according to Guosen Securities. The biggest is a 64.2 billion yuan fund managed by Shanghai-based Hua An Fund Management. Bosera Asset Management’s 28.9 billion-yuan gold ETF was second, followed by a 26.6 billion yuan fund by E Fund Management. All the funds track the benchmark spot gold contract trading on the Shanghai Futures Exchange."

Observers said the state visit marked a departure from Ruto’s initial West-leaning stance and a contrast to the anti-China rhetoric of his presidential bid.
While the Ruto administration lost no time in boosting engagement with the United States and Europe after assuming power, its apparent failure to secure funding, coupled with the challenges of the US tariff war, were behind the recent overtures to China, they said.
With traditional ally the United States imposing trade tariffs and pulling aid, Ruto is seeking new markets, project financing and investors, according to Adhere Cavince, a Nairobi-based international relations researcher."

Tesla is extending its zero-interest incentives for buyers to defend its market share in mainland China and mitigate a slump in worldwide sales, days after being forced to halt orders for imported electric vehicles (EVs) amid a US-China tariff war.
The EV maker will allow consumers to stretch their loan repayment on Model Y SUVs to five years, it said on Tuesday. The sweetened offer, against the current three-year repayment terms, would be available until the end of June, it added.
Buyers could choose an interest-free loan to buy the SUV with a 79,900 yuan (US$10,930) down payment and 3,060 yuan in monthly instalments over five years, it said. The other option involves a 45,900 yuan down payment and 3,718 yuan monthly instalments at 0.98 per cent interest annually over five years.
The SUV is priced between 263,500 and 313,500 yuan, depending on the specifications.

Defence One published an article on Monday based on what it said was an undated, internal memo obtained from the State Department. The document was mainly used to provide talking points for officials, the report said.
Countries dealing with the US were asked to ban satellite services provided by “untrusted suppliers, such as those from China”. The report did not specify if the memo was referring to long-term Western allies or all of the United States’ trading relationships.
Governments were asked to “take steps to exclude untrusted satellite providers, such as those based in China, and make sure they cannot enter the market and jeopardise national security, business secrets and citizens’ privacy”, it said.
The memo said that working with China’s space providers operating in low Earth orbit could help Beijing to advance its foreign policy goals and risked having sensitive information handed over to the Chinese government, according to the report.
Officials were advised to warn that Chinese satellite companies may push out other players, potentially “leaving your host country stuck in a monopolistic, Beijing-controlled market”, it said."

In the directive seen by Reuters, which was dated and effective April 15, the ministry said trade fraud was likely to increase amid growing tension caused by US tariffs.
That in turn would make it “more complicated to avoid sanctions that countries will apply to imported goods” if fraud is not prevented, it said.
The directive did not specifically name any countries where transshipment fraud might originate. However, Vietnam’s goods imports are nearly 40 per cent from China and Washington has openly accused Chinese companies of using the Southeast Asian nation as a transshipment hub to dodge US duties.
Vietnam has been slapped by the Trump administration with a 46 per cent “reciprocal” tariff, currently paused until July, which if applied could seriously undermine a growth model that relies on exports to the US, its top market, and large investments in the country by foreign manufacturers."

President Donald Trump on Monday kept up his verbal assault on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over the Fed’s refusal for now to further cut interest rates, rattling financial markets growing ever more fearful that Trump may ultimately try to fire the US central bank chief over the matter.
Whether Trump has the authority to do so is unclear.
The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 establishing the Fed stipulates that members of its Board of Governors, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate to staggered 14-year terms, can be only be removed for “cause” – long thought to mean misconduct, not policy disagreement.
That said, the law omits reference to limits on removal from its description of the four-year term of the Fed chair, who is one of the seven governors.
There is no direct legal precedent, since no president has ever tried to fire a Fed chief. There are, however, lawsuits now working their way through the courts over unrelated firings by Trump being watched as possible proxies for whether he has that power. One is currently pending before the Supreme Court, where any attempt to fire Powell would almost certainly end up.
A lot would hinge on just how Trump might choose to “fire” the Fed chief.
As each of his predecessors has done, Powell holds three roles – chair of the Federal Reserve System, member of the Board of Governors and chair of the Fed’s interest-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
Were Trump to try to remove Powell only as chair of the Fed system, Powell could remain a governor until that term expires at the end of January 2028. The next scheduled board vacancy does not occur until January 2026, which in the meantime would leave Trump only the option of nominating one of the other incumbent governors to be chair. Two of those other six were appointed by Trump in his first term – governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, whom Trump recently nominated as vice-chair for bank oversight. Both, like Powell, have spoken about the importance of Fed independence, so it is not clear that either immediately would deliver the rate cuts Trump wants.

A previous version of this story incorrectly identified Vivian Chan Wai-lui.
The post-show party ends at 10pm, not 11pm.
In 1998, the American composer and lyricist Stephen Trask paired up with writer and actor John Cameron Mitchell to come up with a groundbreaking rock musical loosely inspired by a German babysitter and prostitute who worked in a small city in the US state of Kansas.
The multi-award winning Hedwig and the Angry Inch has since toured the world, with its genderqueer protagonist winning over fans with her story of longing, trauma, departed identities and self-discovery.
Born “Hansel” in communist East Berlin, Hedwig is full of scars, both figurative (traumatised by past abusive lovers) and literal (a botched sex-change operation that gave her a one-inch flesh mound between her legs).
The story follows Hedwig on tour as she stalks her ex-lover and nemesis – a much more successful musician who was disgusted by Hedwig’s “inch”.
Now, a Cantonese version of Hedwig is coming to Hong Kong, and its creators promise to stay true to the original’s spirit while giving the American tale a local context."

Mourners in Hong Kong have gathered at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception to commemorate Pope Francis a day after his death, with some describing him as a “breath of fresh air” and noting his empathy towards those who felt “unseen”.
The Post observed about a dozen people at the cathedral in Central at around 1pm on Tuesday, with most seated in silence or prayer, while others signed a condolence book near the altar. Several were also seen weeping quietly.
Members of the public will be able to visit and pay their respects between 7am and 7pm every day until Saturday. The condolence service on the final day will end at 4pm.
The Catholic diocese of Hong Kong also told its 400,000 worshippers that the cathedral would host a requiem mass on Monday next week at 8pm.
A message in the cathedral’s condolence book was signed “Stephen Chow” and read: “I am dearly missing you”. Cardinal Stephen Chow Sau-yan is the city’s top Catholic priest.
The message asked the pope to “please pray for the world and the church” in heaven."

Trained by Tony Cruz, Fallon came with a surging late run to win over the Valley 1,800m three starts ago, comfortably beating Charity Gain in the process.
He has remained in good form since, finishing runner up twice at the city circuit including last start when beaten a neck by Jumbo Legend in a Class Three over 2,200m.
Charity Gain was again no match for him in those two runs, but he will need to turn around form with Beauty Alliance, who beat him by three and a half lengths before running below par in the Hong Kong Derby (2,000m).

Fallon gets a 10lbs swing on Beauty Alliance and that could make all the difference in a competitive race.
“He’s in great form,” Thompson said.
“He’s had a win and two seconds in his last three and he meets the same opposition he’s been taking on.
“Whatever is to win that race, being such a strong field, needs everything to go right. He’s really enjoying Happy Valley.
“To be back at Class Three 1,800 – his third time at the course and trip with a win and second at his previous two, he’s ticking all the right boxes.”
Thompson is also confident in the chances of All’s Well, who bids to make it second-time lucky in the Class Four Geranium Handicap (1,000m).
Dennis Yip Chor-hong’s youngster made eye-catching late ground into sixth over the course and distance when sent off an unconsidered $20 outsider on debut this month.
He has a much better draw on this occasion and Thompson is expecting an improved showing in what could be a frantic race.
“He backed up a really nice trial at Happy Valley with that good debut,” said Thompson.
“He’s better drawn on this occasion, so hopefully that’s what he needs to break through.
“There’s nothing like race day, is there? Fully different pressure to what he previously felt there, but he coped really good, especially after he could have been vulnerable when the opposition had started their runs and most had a bit of a margin on him.
“He kept to the task and really rounded off well – better than anything else in the race.
“They’re going to go lickety split, as they generally do over 1,000 at Happy Valley, but I think off nice trials leading into his debut and he’s felt really nice and comfortable in his work since, he can run well.
“Hopefully a kind draw [barrier three] for his second time, it can be second-time lucky.
“In my short involvement with him, he’s a horse that can travel quite strong, so I think the 1,000’s a good fit for him.”"

The UK government has been accused of “sabotaging” the country’s tourism industry as analysis found spending by international visitors was more than 2.2 billion pounds (US$2.9 billion) below pre-pandemic levels last year.
A report by the London-based World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), which represents the sector, found people visiting the UK spent 40.3 billion pounds in 2024, down 5.3 per cent from 2019.
Julia Simpson, president of the WTTC and an adviser to Tony Blair during his time as prime minister, attributed the decline to measures she described as “deliberate policy choices” which have created “barriers to travel”.
These include introducing electronic travel authorisations – digital permits – the lack of tax-free shopping and increasing air passenger duty.
Simpson told the PA news agency: “We’ve not got back to where we need to be [on spending by international visitors], whereas the rest of the world has,” adding that the UK was losing value share compared to other European partners.
“This government is all about growth. They’re looking at how to make money. They’re trying to save steel plants. They’re looking to see what can we do about our water companies,” Simpson said.
“Yet here we have a private sector enterprise – travel and tourism – contributing 10 per cent of UK GDP, creating jobs, but we are not prioritising it in any way,” she added."

Armand ‘Mondo’ Duplantis will head up a stellar cast of athletes kicking off the 16th Diamond League season in Xiamen on Saturday amid a changing landscape that has seen Michael Johnson launch his Grand Slam Track series.
Diamond League CEO Petr Stastny said he welcomed competition, but that the 15-meet circuit he oversees was the “backbone” of global athletics, with a record US$9.2 million in prize money on offer.
“You will get the most comprehensive coverage on the highest possible level of competition in our sport, in track and field. Great arenas, great big crowds,” Stastny said.
Former United States sprint star Johnson is the founder of Grand Slam Track, which debuted in Kingston earlier this month.
Conceived as a way of reinvigorating interest in athletics outside Olympic years, Johnson’s four-event series aims to showcase more races between the world’s best runners, sprinters and hurdlers with no field events.
But Stastny questioned where Grand Slam Track could be defined as a global competition after only one event."

An X-ray examination showed the mammal sustained no injuries, only a minor facial abrasion. It was successfully microchipped and released into the wild on Monday.
A spokesman for the farm said that it was the facility’s mission and vision to release all native animals it took in back into the wild, where they belonged, once they were determined to be fit.
According to the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, civet cats are protected wild animals in Hong Kong. The animal is native to the city and occasionally appears in urban areas."

US government lawyers urged a federal judge on Monday to make Google spin off its Chrome browser, arguing artificial intelligence is poised to ramp up the tech giant’s online search dominance.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) made its pitch at a hearing before District Judge Amit Mehta, who is considering “remedies” after making a landmark decision last year that Google maintained an illegal monopoly in online search.
“Nothing less than the future of the internet is at stake here,” Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater said before the start of the hearing in Washington.
“If Google’s conduct is not remedied, it will control much of the internet for the next decade and not just in internet search, but in new technologies like artificial intelligence.”
Google is among the tech companies investing heavily to be among the leader in AI, and is weaving the technology into search and other online offerings.
Google countered in the case that the United States has gone way beyond the scope of the suit by recommending a spin-off of its widely used Chrome, and holding open the option to force a sale of its Android mobile operating system."

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s purse containing US$3,000 in cash was stolen while she was dining at a popular Washington DC restaurant over the weekend, an incident now under investigation by the US Secret Service.
Noem was eating with her family at The Capital Burger when she felt what she thought was her grandchild brush against her leg, said a person familiar with the incident. Moments later, she realised her purse was missing, according to the person, who is not authorised to speak publicly.
Inside the Gucci shoulder bag were Noem’s DHS security badge, credit and bank cards, passport, blank cheques, prescription medication, driving licence and a Louis Vuitton Clemence wallet, the person said. Her government-issued phone was recovered and has been accounted for.
Surveillance footage showed a white male suspect enter the restaurant at 7.52pm on Sunday, wearing dark trousers, a fur-collared jacket, trainers and a white N95 mask. He sat at a table next to Noem’s at 7.55pm, angled his chair towards her and appeared to watch the floor, according to a law enforcement document reviewed by Bloomberg.
As Noem looked away, the suspect used his foot to slide her purse under his table, then picked it up, covered it with his jacket, and left at 7.56pm. Noem discovered the bag was missing when she stood up to leave.
Noem has served as one of the Trump administration’s most visible figures on immigration enforcement, frequently appearing in television ads and social media campaigns ordering migrants to go home or be found and deported. She has posed on horseback at the southern border region, accompanied federal agents on raids and championed tough-on-immigration messaging in media appearances."

Superintendent Nip Hoi-kwan said on Tuesday that officers would follow up on motorists who breached traffic laws in Central and Wan Chai by recording and monitoring footage from surveillance cameras installed by the Transport Department around the city.
“We will focus on driving behaviours that can cause traffic accidents and serious road blockage, such as stopping their vehicles in restricted areas,” he told a radio show.

Several past and present Cabinet ministers – including Prime Minister Lawrence Wong – paid their respects to Puan Noor Aishah on Tuesday morning at the Ba’alwie Mosque, where funeral prayers were held following her death.
The 91-year-old, who was the wife of Singapore’s first President Yusof Ishak, died peacefully at Singapore General Hospital at about 4.30am on Tuesday.
Wong said she was “thrust into the public spotlight at a very young age” when Yusof was sworn in as Singapore’s first Malayan-born head of state – or Yang di-Pertuan Negara – in 1959.
“She rose to the occasion, and she made a lasting contribution … at a time when we were going through difficulties as a young nation,” Wong told reporters.
“But she was also a force of good in her own right, championing various social causes, and she was patron to various organisations. Many Singaporeans have been touched by her.”
Wong said he met and interacted with Puan Noor Aishah during a few public events and was “always struck by her grace and her dignity”. He also spoke with members of her family, including her son, Dr Imran Yusof Ishak."

Sweden’s Olympic pole vault champion Armand Duplantis was named World Sportsman of the Year at the Laureus World Sports Awards on Monday, while Chinese Paralympic swimmer Jiang Yuyan took home the Sportsperson with a Disability Award.
Duplantis has broken the pole vault world record no fewer than 11 times, as well as winning gold at the 2020 and 2024 Olympic Games and taking two World titles. The Swede beat off the challenge of cyclist Tadej Pogacar and tennis star Carlos Alcaraz to win the Laureus award.
The World Sportswoman of the Year was American gymnast Simone Biles, who claimed her fourth Laureus award after returning to Olympic glory in Paris with three gold medals and a silver medal following a disappointing performance at Tokyo 2020.
Real Madrid were named World Team of the Year ahead of FC Barcelona’s women, who won every possible title in 2024, although Lamine Yamal of the men’s team won the World Breakthrough of the Year award.
“Some decent athletes think I deserve this, so it’s cool, I want to thank everyone for what happens in public and behind the scenes,” Duplantis said. “I am a product of my environment, so I want to thank my family and everyone around me. I have been surrounded by people who inspire me, and if I hadn’t done that, I wouldn’t be here now.”
Jiang, who won seven gold medals at Paris 2024, was named the Sportsperson of the Year with a Disability, with Qu Zimo another Chinese nominee in that category."

For eight decades the United States has built a global order around its interests and values. In 100 days, Donald Trump has torn it down.
The US remains, by most measures, the world’s most powerful country and Trump has vowed to strengthen it further by aggressively promoting domestic business and ramping up military spending.
But the Republican billionaire offers a far more unilateralist vision than any modern US president.
Reviving views long seen as antiquated, Trump has vowed US expansionism, setting sights on the Panama Canal, Greenland and Canada, which he has belittled as the “51st state”.
In another throwback, Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on both friends and foes – a step that was mostly suspended following a market rout, except against China, which is seen as Washington’s top adversary.
Yet the property tycoon turned president who boasts of his deal making skills has also been open to reaching transactional agreements with rivals, including China and Russia."

Hongkongers with spinal cord injuries may have a chance to regain mobility with the help of advanced therapy products developed by a new laboratory at Polytechnic University (PolyU), with clinical trials to start as soon as the facility is fully licensed.
The scholar in charge of the laboratory said the institution hoped the facility could work in tandem with its proposed medical school to provide a one-stop shop for healthcare, ranging from treatment to rehabilitation, contributing to the city’s push to become a health and medical innovation hub.
PolyU is one of three local universities seeking to establish the city’s third medical school.
Professor Larry Chow Ming-cheung, head of the university’s applied biology and chemical technology department, said the advanced therapy products (ATPs) laboratory, which will be the third of its kind in Hong Kong once it is fully licensed, would allow patients greater access to cutting-edge treatments.
ATPs refer to medicines based on genes, cells or tissue. Examples include chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, which uses the patient’s modified T-cells to attack cancer cells.
“Building a production line for ATPs is incredibly expensive for individual companies due to the stringent standards, but our laboratory can essentially attract biopharmaceutical companies to invest in Hong Kong by providing access to a ready-made production facility,” Chow said."

The 61-year-old Mandarin Oriental hotel in Central will undergo a US$100 million renovation demonstrating the company’s continued faith in Hong Kong as a premier tourism destination, the group’s chief executive has said, dismissing suggestions the city suffered from a negative image overseas.
In an exclusive interview with the Post, Laurent Kleitman, group chief executive of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group, said a number of facilities would be revamped and offerings improved over the next 18 months, despite growing global economic tensions fuelled by the US-China trade war that could affect international travel to Hong Kong.
The company will simultaneously undertake a US$100 million facelift of the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Bangkok.
Kleitman said Hong Kong remained an attractive gateway for business, cultural interactions and tourism, as reflected by a series of mega-events the city held last month, ranging from the Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament and concerts at the new Kai Tak Stadium to art shows such as Art Basel.
As for the hotel, it remained an integral part of the city’s cultural dynamism, he added."

E-commerce platform operator PDD Holdings and securities brokerage Futu Holdings are among 27 US-listed Chinese firms that could meet the listing requirements in Hong Kong, leaving at least 170 others at risk of being ejected from American stock exchanges, Goldman Sachs said.
These 27 firms, which have a combined market capitalisation of US$191 billion, could either go for dual-primary or secondary listing in the Asian financial hub, the Wall Street investment bank said in a report on Wednesday. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said “everything’s on the table” as the risk of financial-market decoupling emerges amid a US-China tariff war.
The 170-odd Chinese companies currently ineligible for Hong Kong listing “might consider privatisation or other means to return capital to shareholders in the case of forced delisting on US bourses”, strategists including Kinger Lau and Timothy Moe said in the report.
Apart from PDD and Futu, Goldman also listed Full Truck Alliance, Zeekr Intelligent Technology, Legend Biotech, electronic cigarette producer RLX Technology and TAL Education among those that could turn to Hong Kong to preserve their listing status.
“It is natural for them to consider a listing in Hong Kong,” said Tom Chan Pak-lam, honorary ­president of the Institute of Securities Dealers, an industry body for stockbrokers. “The Chinese central government has shown its full support for Hong Kong’s capital market.”
Some 30 of the biggest US-listed Chinese groups – including the Post’s owner Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com and Baidu – have gained primary or secondary listing in Hong Kong since 2019 after the threat of delisting first emerged over the lack of US access to their audit reports."

The number of registered street sleepers in Hong Kong fell to a 10-year low of 795 in the 2023-24 financial year, but frontline workers have said the actual figure is likely to be higher due to increased evictions from public areas by the government.
Although an increase in the supply of housing in recent years has benefited some street sleepers, social workers said more homeless-friendly policies were necessary to better address the complex needs of the unsheltered and bring down their numbers.
The 795 street sleepers recorded in 2023-24 marked a 40 per cent decline from the 1,441 in the prior financial year, and also the first time the figure had fallen into the three digits since 2017-18, according to data revealed by the Social Welfare Department in early April.
For the 2024-25 financial year, the government has only provided the figure for the first nine months – 672 as of December.
Deep Ng Siu-hong, head of programmes at ImpactHK, an NGO serving homeless people, said the government figures were inaccurate because frontline workers continued to see an increase in demand for services.

About 70 shops in Hong Kong have allegedly sold banned oxo-degradable plastic products, including waste bags for pets, according to an environmental charity.
The Green Earth said its investigation suggested that plastic bags, bin liners and waste bags for pets labelled as “oxo-degradable” were still being sold by large retail shops and online stores, prompting lawmakers to accuse the government of not adequately educating the public on the ban.
Hong Kong implemented legislation to reduce the use of plastic products starting in April last year.
As part of the law, the city has banned the production, supply and sale of all oxo-degradable plastic products, regardless of whether they are disposable.
The Environmental Protection Department said oxo-degradable plastics were less environmentally friendly than other materials because they broke down into microplastics, exacerbating their harmful effects on ecologies and hindering recycling efforts.
Steven Chan Wing-kit, an assistant environmental affairs manager at The Green Earth, said the group’s investigation suggested that about 70 shops were still selling products containing the material as of earlier this month."

US Treasuries will remain a dominant safe-haven asset amid limited alternatives, supported by potential US government interventions to stabilise the market despite short-term volatility, according to analysts.
The US government bond market was in focus after a sharp sell-off in the second week of April following President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs. The possibility of overseas investors reducing their US dollar and debt positions as leverage also challenged US Treasuries’ safe-haven status.
However, the US government debt market stabilised last week after US officials said they were committed to addressing the situation and would deploy tools if needed.
US Treasuries’ performance fell 2.4 per cent in the week to April 11, the biggest weekly slide since 2001 amid sell-offs, according to Bloomberg data. Last week, the securities rose 0.8 per cent.
“Despite all the discussion on US Treasuries, we still think there is an investment case; you may just want to stick with short duration [debt] to avoid price volatility,” Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia-Pacific at JPMorgan Asset Management, said in a briefing on Wednesday."

US trade officials finalised tariff levels on solar cells and panels from Southeast Asia, a key step towards wrapping up a year-old trade case brought by American manufacturers that accuse their overseas rivals of flooding the market with unfairly cheap goods.
The decision comes after the Commerce Department last year imposed preliminary anti-dumping and anti-subsidy countervailing duties on solar equipment from Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam.
The case was brought by Korea’s Hanwha Qcells, Arizona-based First Solar Inc, and several smaller producers seeking to protect billions of dollars in investments in US solar manufacturing.
The group, the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, accused big Chinese solar panel makers with factories in Southeast Asia of shipping panels priced below their cost of production and of receiving unfair subsidies that make American goods uncompetitive.
The group was not immediately available for comment.
According to a decision posted on the US Commerce Department’s website on Monday, the agency calculated dumping duties of 6.1 per cent to 271.28 per cent, depending on the company and country. Anti-subsidy countervailing duties were between 14.64 per cent and 3,403.96 per cent."

Noodles are said to have been invented in China more than 4,000 years ago, with some accounts claiming Marco Polo brought them to Italy during the 13th century.
If this is true, Italian-Chinese fusion should feel like a natural pairing.
However, even slight deviations from Italian recipes have been known to spark fierce objections from traditionalists on the internet and beyond.
But for one MasterChef Italia contestant, the courage to blend the two cuisines and break from tradition was the thing that ultimately led her to victory.
In February, Italian-Chinese cook Anna Zhang Yilan was crowned the winner of the 14th season of MasterChef Italia. She was the first ethnically Chinese contestant to win the Italian TV cooking contest.

China’s economic reform over the past decade has been a controlled process of privatisation, liberalisation and deregulation, and that process has historically only gathered pace when external pressure accumulates. After all, change is only necessary when maintaining the status quo is no longer viable.
In this regard, US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose “up to 245 per cent” tariffs on Chinese products, which is set to curb trade flows between China and one of its key markets, is expected to result in huge external pressure on China to review its economic strategy and growth model, leading to decisive, long-overdue action to boost domestic consumption.
The situation could be similar to the 1997 Asian financial crisis, when China’s export boom ground to a halt, forcing the leadership to search for growth engines at home. The government made a number of key decisions, including closing or selling unprofitable state-owned enterprises, creating an urban housing market and accelerating efforts to join the World Trade Organization.
These strategic decisions were not without controversy or cost. Debate continues to this day about whether some of the measures – including laying off millions of state-sector workers without a social safety net – could have been implemented in a less brutal and hasty way. But overall, the shift from a command economy to a market economy laid the foundation for China’s economic ascent in the following decades.
More importantly, these economic reforms changed public perception and many people’s lifestyles. As China’s export machine lost steam during the financial crisis, the government sought ways of encouraging domestic consumption. This led to the introduction of “golden week” holidays, which encouraged people to pursue leisure and pleasure during week-long breaks for Labour Day in May and National Day in October. This was completely at odds with the Communist orthodoxy that prefers a frugal and spartan lifestyle."

Chinese humanoid robot maker Unitree Robotics has opened a new factory in Hangzhou as it races to meet soaring demand amid China’s craze for the human-shaped machines.
The factory, launched earlier this year, spans over 10,000 square metres, and it is expected to support the company’s expansion over the next three to five years, according to the company.
“We won’t expand production blindly,” Unitree’s marketing director Huang Jiawei told the South China Morning Post in a recent interview. “Instead, we’ll enhance capacity by increasing working hours and efficiency.”
The move was supported by the municipal government, which helped the company locate a plant just a 15-minute drive from Unitree’s headquarters in China’s eastern Zhejiang province.
As one of China’s most successful robotics start-ups, Unitree’s supply chain management and production capacity are seen as key advantages that set it apart in an industry where many peers struggle to commercialise their products, even as competition heats up in the domestic market. The company’s Go2 robotic dog starts at US$1,600, while its G1 humanoid starts at US$16,000.

Carmakers should improve product safety designs and develop effective warning systems to alert drivers, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said on Monday in a joint statement with the China Society of Automotive Engineers. The groups outlined several initiatives to guide carmakers in standardising the promotion and application of driver-assistance systems.
The country’s EV industry “has developed rapidly and the combined driver assistance (level 2 driving automation) has entered a critical period of large-scale application”, the statement said. The initiatives were aimed at “building a healthy ecosystem and promoting the safe application of driver assistance products”, it added.

Xiaomi to cooperate with police after fatal crash involving self-drive feature on SU7 EV
The MIIT told the company representatives that the words “smart driving”, “advanced smart driving” and “autonomous driving” could not be used in promoting existing self-driving systems.
In mainland China, most available self-driving ­systems are classified as either level 2 (L2) or L2+, both of which require drivers to keep their hands on the wheel at all times. Beijing has yet to legalise L3 – a “hands-off” system based on standards set by US-based SAE International. All drivers are required to be fully alert, even with the system turned on.
A Xiaomi SU7 crashed in central Anhui province last month, claiming three lives. The car was travelling at 116km/h on a highway with the driver-assistance system engaged, adding that the system alerted the driver to take over the wheel two seconds before it hit a concrete barrier, the EV maker said."

Harvard University sued US President Donald Trump’s administration on Monday in a sharp escalation of the fight between the prestigious university and the Republican, who has threatened its US$2.2 billion in funding and sought to impose outside political supervision.
Trump has sought to bring several prestigious universities to heel over claims they tolerated campus antisemitism, threatening their budgets, tax-exempt status and the enrolment of foreign students, but Harvard has refused to bow.
“This case involves the government’s efforts to use the withholding of federal funding as leverage to gain control of academic decision-making at Harvard,” the Ivy League university said in a lawsuit filed in a Massachusetts federal court that named several other institutions targeted by Trump.
Trump and his White House team have publicly justified their campaign against universities as a reaction to what they said is uncontrolled “antisemitism” and a need to reverse diversity programmes aimed at addressing historical oppression of minorities.
White House spokesman Harrison Fields said in a statement that the “gravy train of federal assistance” to institutions like Harvard was coming to an end."

“Melania and I will be going to the funeral of Pope Francis, in Rome,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. “We look forward to being there!”
Pope Francis died on Monday morning aged 88 after suffering a stroke and subsequent heart failure, according to the Vatican.
His funeral will nevertheless be a global event, with heads of state and government from around the world expected to attend.
Cardinals are expected to meet in the Vatican on Tuesday to discuss the funeral arrangements, with the burial usually taking place four to six days after death.
Just hours before his death, Francis briefly met Trump’s deputy, Vice-President J.D. Vance, on Sunday, who has made a number of trips abroad since the new administration took office.
For Trump, however, it would be the first foreign trip since returning to the White House on January 20."

And the admiration flowed both ways. Following news of the Pope’s death on Monday at the age of 88, Messi took to Instagram to pay tribute.
“A different Pope, close, Argentinian … Rest in peace, Pope Francis,” the eight-time Ballon d’Or winner posted. “Thank you for making the world a better place. We will miss you.”
Francis often recounted playing as a young boy on the streets of Buenos Aires, using a ball made of rags.

The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts in the same federal courthouse in Manhattan where a different jury convicted Bob Menendez of many of the same charges last year. The Democrat is supposed to begin serving an 11-year prison term in June.

Repeatedly during the trial, prosecutors said they were “partners in crime”.
During a 2022 raid on the couple’s Englewood Cliffs home in New Jersey, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents found nearly US$150,000 worth of gold bars and US$480,000 in cash stuffed in boots, shoeboxes and jackets. In the garage was a Mercedes-Benz convertible, also an alleged bribe.

The death of Pope Francis on Easter Monday reverberated across the Philippines, as the deeply Catholic nation mourned the loss of a beloved spiritual figure affectionately known as “Lolo Kiko” – a local nickname meaning “Grandpa Francis”, derived from the common shorthand for those with that name.
“He was truly Lolo Kiko for us,” said Archbishop Socrates Villegas, the most senior Catholic prelate in the country. “Although we grieve like orphans … we also stand firm in faith and hope that the radiance of the risen Lord will shine upon him forever.”
Villegas recalled the pope’s quiet support during a turbulent period in Philippine politics.
“When I was mocked and ridiculed and threatened by government authorities in my stand against the extrajudicial killings,” he said, referring to former president Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs, “he assured me and encouraged me personally in Rome to carry on my task of guiding the flock through my pastoral letters.”
“He knew his bishops. He knew our tears. He knew us and he loved us. He taught us not to fear,” the monsignor said.
Cardinal Pablo Virgilio David, president of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, the church policymaking body, was quoted by Reuters as saying, “Oh my God. I am so shocked by this."

“She’s never suffered like that, it’s what I’ve wanted for the past year-and-a-half, and it could be a turning point.”
A supercharged Ng claimed Hong Kong’s only senior gold of the meeting, which doubled as a test event for November’s National Games."

Hong Kong paid tribute to Pope Francis after his death on Monday at age 88, with religious and political figures worldwide praising him as a champion of peace and an “inspirational leader” who pushed to reform the church.
The first Latin American leader of the Catholic Church suffered a serious bout of double pneumonia earlier this year, raising fears over his long-term health, but he appeared to have recovered and greeted cheering crowds in St Peter’s Square in Vatican City on Easter Sunday.
“Dear brothers and sisters, it is with profound sadness [that] I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis,” Cardinal Kevin Farrell announced on the Vatican’s TV channel.
“At 7.35 this morning the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father.”
Farrell will preside over a rite at 8pm on Monday at the Vatican, when the pope’s body will be placed into a casket. A funeral will be held at a later date.
The Catholic diocese of Hong Kong told its 400,000 worshippers it would arrange a service and a liturgy so they could bid farewell to Francis, with details to be announced later."

Let’s take a look at the numbers. The US is Hong Kong’s third largest trading partner, according to data from the city’s Census and Statistics Department.
In 2024, Hong Kong’s total exports to the US were worth HK$295.5 billion and imports from the country were worth HK$206 billion. Hong Kong total exports to and imports from the world were worth about HK$4.5 trillion and HK$4.9 trillion respectively. In other words, Hong Kong’s export and import figures to the US were 6.5 per cent and 4 per cent respectively of total global exports and imports. These figures include the transshipment of goods going to and coming from the mainland.
Transshipment might not contribute much to Hong Kong in real money terms, but we must bear in mind that the sector boosts Hong Kong’s status as a logistics hub, especially in the context of trade with the mainland. Any weakening of this position may translate into weakening the importance of the logistics sector in the eyes of Hong Kong’s other trading partners. This cannot be measured in real money terms."

Several incidents of male university students posting videos of themselves running after female students at night – presented as a supposedly comedic attempt to help them get home safely – have sparked public outrage in South Korea, with critics arguing that they trivialise women’s fear of being followed by strangers.
The Instagram account for a student group under Korea University’s Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering last week posted a 10-second video of a man chasing after a woman down an empty street at night, according to The Korea Times.
The video, titled “Choosing a random woman and helping her get home safely”, shows the woman running away in apparent fear, without looking back.
Originally posted to promote the student group’s midterm snack giveaway event, the video sparked online backlash.
Netizens criticised the video as a mockery of the fear and panic that women felt when approached or followed by unknown men at night, especially as this was not the first time that such videos had gone viral in South Korea.
Students from Chungbuk National University and Hanbat National University also posted videos with similar captions last week, where two to three male students were depicted chasing a female student down an empty street at night."

Hong Kong authorities have proposed banning the use of konjac in cups of mini jelly under a certain size, following a coroner’s suggestion that the government consider prohibiting such products due to the risk of choking.
The proposal was outlined in a paper to the Legislative Council ahead of a panel meeting on Thursday, with the document highlighting the government’s plans to update food safety regulations covering konjac-containing confectionery jellies and metallic contamination thresholds.
The paper said Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu had set out in last year’s policy address to “review food safety standards for metal content in food … with reference to international standards and practices”.
The review would also take into account “the dietary habits and styles of the Hong Kong population, risk assessment results and stakeholders’ concerns”, it said.
On the subject of konjac jellies, the paper said that while the thickening agent was considered a safe food additive, it posed choking hazards, particularly in mini-cup jellies, due to their texture and how they were consumed.
The document cited a coroner’s recommendation to the Centre for Food Safety last year that such products should be banned after the death of a seven-year-old girl in 2021 was determined to have resulted from choking on confectionery jelly at school."

A Thai-Chinese company denied on Monday allegations its steel rods did not pass safety standard tests after nationwide criticism prompted an investigation into the collapse of a high-rise building under construction after an earthquake last month in Bangkok.
Authorities are probing Xin Ke Yuan Steel and another Chinese contractor involved in the construction to find out why the building crumbled following a quake centred in Myanmar, more than 1,200km (800 miles) away. It was the only building that completely collapsed that day.
The 7.7 magnitude quake on March 28 killed more than 3,700 in Myanmar, while in Thailand, 47 were killed, mostly at the collapse site, and 47 others went missing.
The collapse sparked questions about the enforcement of construction safety and the state-run Chinese contractor, China Railway No. 10 Engineering Group, leading to the arrest on Saturday of its Chinese executive in Thailand, identified by the surname Zhang, on suspicion of operating the business through the use of nominees.
Foreigners can operate a business in Thailand, but it must be a joint venture with a Thai partner, and they cannot own more than 49 per cent to protect local competitiveness.
Three Thai shareholders of the company are also wanted on suspicion of being the nominees, said officials of the Department of Special Investigation, Thailand’s equivalent of the FBI. They also said they were looking into the quality of the construction material and whether the company illegally fixed its bidding."

Taiwan will require Hongkongers seeking to settle on the self-ruled island to undergo a “national security observation period” and will introduce a new long-term visa for them, a local minister has said.
Chiu Chui-cheng, Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council minister, was reported by local media on Sunday as saying the island needed to bolster security requirements for Hongkongers applying for all types of residency given changes in Hong Kong and shifts in the make-up of its population following an influx of mainland Chinese.
Authorities planned to introduce a new “long-term residency” visa for Hongkongers who wished to travel freely to work in Taiwan without applying for permanent residency, he added.
“We will include a national security observation period to ensure overall safety on crowd control,” he said on the sidelines of an event.
“[The long-term residency visa] serves as an additional option for Hongkongers, while it acts as a safety measure for Taiwanese.”
According to Taiwanese media, local authorities are still studying the details of the new visa scheme, under which Hongkongers will not be allowed to hold a Taiwanese identification card or take part in elections.
One Taiwanese media outlet on Monday cited sources as saying local authorities planned to tighten the requirement for Hongkongers applying for permanent residency to tackle a “national security loophole”."

Chinese tyre manufacturers, especially those with overseas facilities close to key Western markets, could emerge stronger from the global tariff war as consumers switch to cheaper alternatives, according to analysts.
The US will impose a uniform 25 per cent duty on all imports of automobile parts on May 3, which could lead American consumers to consider cheaper Chinese brands for their replacement tyres.
“Due to lower prices, Chinese brands will have an edge over European, Japanese and South Korean rivals for the same effectiveness,” Zhang Tingzhou and Song Tingting, analysts at Huatai Securities, said in a report.
Higher-priced global brands like France’s Michelin and Japan’s Bridgestone, which have a higher sales exposure to the US market, are thus more vulnerable to margin erosion, they noted.
The US imported tyres from Thailand at US$38 each on average last year, compared with US$79 from Japan and US$177 from France, the analysts said, citing data from the US International Trade Commission and business-to-business e-commerce platform SimpleTire.

A visit to India by US Vice-President J.D. Vance this week has raised hopes in New Delhi of progress towards a long-awaited trade agreement that could help avert looming American import tariffs.
Although Vance’s four-day trip is officially personal – he arrived in Delhi on Monday with his Indian-origin wife Usha and their three children – he is scheduled to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval during his stay.
Harsh Pant, professor of international relations at King’s College London, said Vance’s emergence as the most visible face of US foreign policy under President Donald Trump made the visit particularly important, adding that India was likely to use the opportunity to signal it was “serious in progressing towards a trade deal with the US”.
A trade deal between India and the United States could significantly enhance economic ties between the two countries and potentially strengthen diplomatic ties.
The US is India’s largest trading partner and their two-way bilateral trade reached US$129 billion in 2024, with a US$45.7 billion surplus in favour of India, US government trade data show, according to a Reuters report on Monday.
In early April, the US imposed a 26 per cent tariff on Indian imports, part of a broader strategy targeting countries with significant trade surpluses with the US. However, Trump later announced a 90-day suspension of these additional tariffs for most countries, including India, reducing the rate to a baseline 10 per cent until July 9."

A record 529 suicides were reported in 2024 among elementary, junior high and senior high school students – surpassing the previous high of 514 set in 2022 – with a significant increase among girls, according to a report by the Asahi newspaper citing health ministry data.
The leading causes were linked to school-related stressors, such as poor academic performance, conflicts with peers and anxiety over future career prospects, which were cited in more than 51 per cent of the cases.
Health problems, including depression, were cited in 31 per cent of cases, while family-related issues were a factor in 20 per cent of cases.
September saw the highest number of student suicides, coinciding with the end of summer break and the start of Japan’s second school term, a time when back-to-school anxiety can be heightened. Official statistics have previously shown that September 1 historically has the highest suicide rate among those under 18.

Chinese table tennis fans voiced despair about the country’s men’s performances on Monday after Lin Shidong’s shock loss at the ITTF World Cup in Macau, with many calling for the return of Ma Long and Fan Zhendong.
World No 1 Lin’s 4-1 reverse against Brazil’s Hugo Calderano in Sunday’s final saw the hashtag “Chinese table tennis really needs to reflect” shoot to the top of Weibo’s trending list with more than 100 million views.
“Chinese table tennis should indeed reflect on itself, or more precisely, the Chinese men’s table tennis team should seriously reflect on itself,” one of the top comments read, lamenting “legacy issues such as Ma Long and Fan Zhendong” and suggesting “changes in the entire environment”.
Ma, last year’s World Cup winner, and popular Olympic singles champion Fan withdrew from the World Table Tennis rankings in December over a dispute about fines for players withdrawing from competitions, clearing the way for 19-year-old rising star Lin to claim the No 1 slot.
Olympic champions – such as Fan and Ma – were permitted to enter some tournaments even if they were not ranked, and exemptions were granted to allow players to miss events without being fined. This, however, has yet to lure back the pair."

French star Goliath, top Japanese filly Liberty Island, Bahrain galloper Calif and Australian Group One winners Mr Brightside and Royal Patronage cantered on the all-weather track as they continued their build-up to Sunday’s showpiece meeting.
A brilliant winner of last year’s Group One King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes (2,392m) at Ascot, the Francis-Henri Graffard-trained Goliath caught the eye with his trademark stringhalt ahead of his much-anticipated tilt at the Group One QE II Cup (2,000m).
“He’s all good. He travelled very well. I’m very happy today because he’s a lovely horse and very relaxed,” travelling head lad Anthony David said.

“It was his first time on the track here but he was perfect today. He has his special move, but he’s a very good horse. Today he did a hack steady canter and we’ll probably do that for a day or two. I’ll speak to the trainer about possibly going on the turf.”
Fellow QE II Cup contender Liberty Island has pleased the Mitsumasa Nakauchida stable since arriving in Hong Kong for the second time, following her second to champion galloper Romantic Warrior in December’s Group One Hong Kong Cup (2,000m).
The multiple Group One winner had excuses last start in the Group One Dubai Turf (1,800m), finishing eighth behind Soul Rush after being trapped wide throughout.
“Her condition has been improving compared to when she was in Dubai,” Nakauchida’s assistant trainer Yuya Katayama said.
“While in Dubai, the quarantine stables were located in the middle of the desert and the surroundings allowed her to graze freely, so it seems she thought she was simply out at pasture for rest. The high temperatures there also made a difference and the climate here suits her better. She will work on the turf once more this week.”
Mr Brightside, who bids for a 10th Group One victory in the Champions Mile, continues to please co-trainers Ben, Will and JD Hayes after arriving in the city early last week.
“He just worked around quietly. He will be having a nice, easy gallop tomorrow,” Ben Hayes said.
“He will just be quickening down the straight and will be running home on the bridle and just keeping him happy.”

American film composer Aaron Zigman’s musical drama Émigré, about Jewish refugees in Shanghai in the late 1930s, will make its Hong Kong debut in an updated version that its composer says will “complete” an emotional journey that began in 2019.
That was the year prominent Chinese conductor Yu Long invited Zigman, who is classically trained, and lyricists Mark Campbell and Brock Walsh to take part in the Émigré project, a joint commission by the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic.
Zigman is known for writing the music for more than 60 Hollywood films – including the 2004 box office hit The Notebook and the 2008 film version of Sex and the City – and for writing and arranging popular albums for musical legends such as Quincy Jones, Aretha Franklin and Tina Turner.
It took over three years for Zigman to complete Émigré and it only happened after he finally made his first visit to Shanghai, in 2023, amid growing Sino-US tensions. He fell in love with the city as soon as he landed, he says.
“Never in my life have I ever sat in a park and seen people at [5.30pm] dancing in a park, and in perfect synchronicity also doing tai chi,” he tells the Post. “That was the inspiration for one of the pieces in the second act that I wrote.”
Premiering in Shanghai in November 2023, followed by performances in New York and Berlin, Émigré is a love story between a Jewish man – who was among tens of thousands of Jews who fled Nazi Germany for Shanghai – and a local Chinese woman."

Mainland Chinese stocks have weathered global market volatility better than most, triggered by the US tariff war, because of state buying and better-than-expected economic data, with analysts saying Beijing is likely to keep a tight grip on proceedings through various means at its disposal.
China’s CSI 300 Index, which tracks the biggest companies traded onshore, has lost 2.6 per cent since US President Donald Trump on April 2 initiated the so-called reciprocal tariffs on America’s trading partners. In comparison, the S&P 500 index has declined nearly 6 per cent in that time, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index and Japan’s Nikkei 225 have lost 7.5 per cent and 3.8 per cent, respectively.
In terms of volatility, the CSI 300 has been the least choppy, gyrating 10 per cent this month. In contrast, the S&P 500 and the Nikkei 225 have both experienced swings of 15 per cent, while the Hang Seng Index has fluctuated 18 per cent, according to data compiled by Shanghai DZH, a financial services provider.
“Clearly, we have a bottom here that is underpinned [by state buying],” said He Kang, an analyst at Huatai Securities in Shanghai. “The market is now stuck in rangebound trading, as it also lacks the upside potential because of the uncertainty regarding the tariffs.”

The event, in which the world’s highest-ranked players will compete for a prize pool of US$1.3 million, will take place at Hong Kong Coliseum from December 10 to 14.
“Hong Kong is a city that understands the power of big moments,” said Steve Dainton, CEO of World Table Tennis (WTT), as his organisation announced the news.

“We’re excited to bring WTT Finals here, and we see great potential for Hong Kong to be a strategic host for WTT’s most iconic events moving forward.”
WTT said that Hong Kong’s “global reputation as one of Asia’s sporting hubs, combined with its deep-rooted connection to table tennis, made it a natural choice for an event of this calibre”."

The designation of smoke-free floors at public estates to reduce Hong Kong’s smoking rate is technically infeasible and unfair to low-income tenants, lawmakers have said, following a statutory body’s proposal.
They also said on Monday that implementing the measure proposed by the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health could potentially prolong the already lengthy wait time for public housing due to the shortage of flats. It could deny residents the right to choose to smoke.
“It’s definitely only possible in new housing estates before people moved in, because in the existing ones, there is no way we could distinguish between residents who smoke and those who do not,” Scott Leung Man-kwong, a member of the legislature’s housing panel, told a radio programme.
“Let’s say we were to implement this in existing housing estates, how do we relocate those who do not wish to live next to residents who smoke elsewhere? This could bring about practical difficulties in putting it into practice.”
He added that there could be further issues, such as residents’ preferences for higher or lower floors and the direction the flats faced, noting that he had “strong reservations” about the measure that could not be solved in a short period of time.
According to him, residents frequently complain about smokers leaving their front doors open, exposing children and the elderly in flats along the same corridor to second-hand smoke."

He also rides consistent sprinter Lucky With You in his latest clash with superstar Ka Ying Rising in the Group One Chairman’s Sprint Prize (1,200m).
A revelation this campaign with four wins and as many placings, the Mark Newnham-trained My Wish was the star of the recent four-year-old series with victory in the Classic Mile and seconds in the Classic Cup (1,800m) and Hong Kong Derby (2,000m).
“It’s nice to have a horse like that to look forward to,” Ferraris said of the pint-sized My Wish.
“It’s been an amazing journey so far, just with his progression from when he first came into the yard to where he is now. I don’t think anyone in the stable would have believed you if you told them he’d be where he is today when he first stepped out on the track. It’s been an amazing team effort – credit to Mark and his team.”
My Wish drops back to 1,600m after a mesmerising Derby run, storming home from last after jumping from gate 14 to fall narrowly short of gunning down Cap Ferrat.
The son of Flying Artie recorded the fastest final 400m over 2,000m at Sha Tin since sectional timing was introduced in 2008 when only beaten a short head.
“He reeled off an insanely quick time in the Derby,” Ferraris said.
“The barrier was just costly, but he seems to have come through it well. His work leading up to it has been good, his trial was nice and he came through that well. It’s going to be a good test.”

Ferraris is hoping for a draw between one and six after My Wish has jumped from eight or wider in his past six starts.
“I think it will be interesting with the barriers – that’s going to play a big part,” the rider said.
“My Wish has got gate speed but we don’t want to burn too much energy early on. The mile’s probably his comfort zone at the moment. It’s obviously a really tough race, but I’ll be hoping for a decent barrier.”
Ferraris has built a successful partnership with Lucky With You in his three rides on Frankie Lor Fu-chuen’s seven-year-old, guiding him to back-to-back Class One victories before a solid third to Ka Ying Rising in the Group Two Sprint Cup (1,200m) last start.
“Lucky With You is just a soldier. He’ll be running into the money,” said Ferraris, who will ride on Champions Day for the first time since 2022.
As for the rest of the season, Ferraris plans to take it one meeting at a time rather than setting any specific goals.
“You can set those goals but then get frustrated at yourself when things aren’t going your way, so I’m just looking to get the best out of each horse at each meeting,” said Ferraris, who sits fifth in the jockeys’ championship.
“I’ve been doing that this season and it seems to be working, so we’ll just continue with it. I think if I can keep the momentum rolling through, it should work out quite nicely.
“The support’s been a lot better and more consistent and it’s been good to capitalise on that.”"

Baron Guy Ullens, the Belgian businessman and philanthropist known for his pioneering contemporary art centre in Beijing and a violent family tragedy two years ago, died on April 19 at the age of 90.
Ullens was born in San Francisco into an aristocratic Belgian family, and spent his early years moving from one country to another because of his father’s career as a diplomat.
After graduating with a law degree from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (now KU Leuven) in Belgium, and an MBA from Stanford University in the US, he joined his family’s sugar refinery business, Raffinerie Tirlemontoise, and orchestrated its 1989 sale to Germany’s Südzucker.
In 1999, as head of investment company Artal Group, he acquired majority control of Weight Watchers International through what Forbes described as “the private equity deal of the century”. It was a highly profitable move that made him one of Belgium’s richest individuals.

Hong Kong has the potential to become a high-profile art-dealing hub for global collectors due to its low taxes and location, which can be enhanced with more museums, infrastructure and talent, according to academics.
Unlike many overseas markets that require buyers and sellers to pay taxes, Hong Kong has no sales tax or capital gains tax, and offers a low-tax regime for individuals and businesses, making the city ideally suited to become an art-trading hub, according to Joost Schokkenbroek, a professor of museum studies at the University of Hong Kong (HKU).
Schokkenbroek was part of a team at HKU that was instrumental in launching a one-year museum studies course to train talent in management, marketing and fundraising for museums.
“The course is gaining traction,” he said, pointing out that 66 students had enrolled in the programme this year, up from 45 in the inaugural year. This, he said, would help in providing talent required for art management in the city.
Schokkenbroek’s home country, the Netherlands, has nearly 1,000 museums for a population of 18 million, or one for every 18,000 people. In contrast, Hong Kong has about 50 museums for 7.5 million people – one for every 150,000 people.
In March 2023, the government unveiled eight measures to attract wealthy individuals to establish family offices to manage their wealth, facilitate succession planning, oversee art collections and support charity work. One of the measures was the development of an art-storage facility at the Hong Kong International Airport, which is due to open later this year."

French fries are apparently crunchier, salmon juicier and roasted broccoli even crispier when cooked with a fast, fat-free air fryer. Amateur chefs love the versatile gadgets that do not cause smells in the kitchen.
“A hot-air fryer is a kitchen appliance in which food can be deep-fried, grilled, baked and cooked using hot air,” says Steffi Sinzenich, who runs a food blog.
“Food becomes particularly crispy and hardly any oil is needed. Things like French fries or breaded dishes are lower in fat and healthier.
“The circulating hot air means that food is cooked evenly and usually faster than in an oven.”
Air fryers have a closed oven, so there is no smell of fat in the kitchen. That is why many like making burgers and meatballs in an air fryer.
Most appliances have fixed programmes with preset temperatures and cooking times for dishes like French fries, vegetables, meat or bread, making them easier to use."

Hong Kong e-commerce businesses and American consumers are expected to bear the brunt of DHL Express’ temporary suspension of business-to-consumer shipments worth more than US$800 to individuals in the US, industry representatives have predicted.
But they expected the pause would be temporary as US customs worked to clear a backlog of packages after the Trump administration imposed additional tariffs on Chinese goods.
The tariff on small parcels sent to the US from China will be further raised to 120 per cent from 90 per cent.
Commerce sector lawmaker Jeffrey Lam Kin-fung told the Post he believed e-commerce businesses would be hit hardest by the halt as they mostly shipped directly to customers, while American consumers would need to bear higher prices for imported goods.
“For example, those starting university and looking to shop online for back-to-school items will be affected and have to find alternative platforms,” he said. “This also affects Americans in Hong Kong who want to make purchases to send back home.”
Lam said he believed the temporary suspension was imposed because DHL was waiting for a backlog of packages to clear US customs."

You may have noticed people talking about the viral “12-3-30” workout on social media, or seen the workouts for yourself at the gym – just look for the people walking at a very high incline on the treadmills.
The workout, created by social media influencer Lauren Giraldo, has received a lot of attention for its simplicity and results. It involves walking for 30 minutes on a treadmill at a 3mph (4.8km/h) pace at a 12 per cent incline.
“I’m not a runner, and running on the treadmill was not working for me,” Giraldo told Today magazine.
“I started playing around with the settings, and at the time, my gym’s treadmill had 12 incline as the max. The three miles per hour felt right, like walking, and my grandma had always told me that 30 minutes of exercise a day was all you needed. That’s how the combination started.”
Giraldo first shared the workout on YouTube in 2019, but it continues to grow in popularity on TikTok. The video has amassed more than 1.6 million views on YouTube and more than 13 million views on TikTok."

In an online video, the cat is seen walking back and forth on glass curtain wall supports and occasionally stretching its head out to look around.
Police said staff members at the IFC Mall reported seeing the cat measuring one metre (3.2 feet) on the premises at 7am on Monday.
Police, the Fire Services Department, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals were called to the scene, according to the force.
The animal was caught with a net and handed over to the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden in Tai Po.
The conservation department said it dispatched staff to the scene after receiving a referral from a government hotline. It said the civet cat weighed about 4kg (8.8lbs)."

Home favourite Wu Ashun charged to a second Volvo China Open triumph on Sunday, a decade after his first, as five back-nine birdies propelled him to a final-round 65 and a one-stroke victory in Shanghai.
The Chinese veteran rolled back the years to thrill packed home galleries at Anting Golf Club as he carded just one bogey, on the fifth, against seven birdies, to finish at 14-under par 270.
It was enough to give the 39-year-old a one-stroke margin over playing partner Jordan Smith of England, who had a 67, as overnight leaders Eugenio Chacarra and Li Haotong faltered after both began at 12-under.
Germany’s Yannick Paul was third, two strokes behind Wu on 272, after signing for a two-under 69.
“It’s very special,” Wu said as he celebrated his fifth win on the European-based tour – his maiden triumph had come in the same event at the Tomson course across Shanghai in 2015.
“That was 10 years ago and coming back to Shanghai, I win again. I mean, it’s amazing,” Wu added after his first DP World Tour victory since the 2022 Kenya Open."

Oscar Piastri won the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix on Sunday and seized the Formula One championship lead from McLaren teammate Lando Norris with his third win in five races.
Red Bull’s four-times champion Max Verstappen was runner-up, 2.843 seconds behind the Australian, after starting from pole at Jeddah’s Corniche circuit, with Charles Leclerc taking Ferrari’s first podium of 2025 in third. Norris finished fourth, after racing back from 10th.
Verstappen’s plan unravelled within seconds of the start when he and Piastri went wheel-to-wheel into the first corner, with the champion running wide to stay ahead and collecting a five-second penalty that he served in the pits.
“It was a pretty tough race,” Piastri said after 50 laps in 30 degree heat. “I’m very, very happy to have won.
“Made the difference at the start. Made my case into Turn One, and that was enough. Definitely one of the toughest races I’ve had in my career.”

The five cases included a fatality, a 73-year-old man with chronic diseases.
“If the city has an asymptomatic patient, the disease can spread in the community easily,” Kwan warned.
“Apart from the government, healthcare professionals and doctors should proactively provide more information for residents to understand more about the disease and undertake precautionary measures.”
The infection, caused by the meningococcus bacterium, can result in a high fever, a severe headache, a stiff neck, vomiting, rashes or even death."

Olympic mixed doubles champions Wang and Sun have amassed a feverish following, particularly among young female spectators, who are willing spend large sums to watch their idols at a time when the country’s central government looks to capitalise on consumer spending on sport.

Hong Kong players and coaches were able to find positives, however, with women’s forward Lam Wing-yi saying her side “executed our plans well” before their youth was trumped by SELL’s experience.
“I can’t say I’m really disappointed,” said Lam, who scored three times in the defeat. “We came into this game with personal goals we had set ourselves regarding offensive plays – and the goals all came from good teamwork.”
For the men, it was a disappointing end to an otherwise impressive tournament after they beat favourites Fogo 10-5 in the semi-finals.

A 38-year-old senior executive from Hong Kong has been found dead at a popular ski resort in northwestern Japan.
Contact was lost with the Chinese national, a senior executive, on Friday while he was snowboarding at the Gala Yuzawa Snow Resort in Niigata prefecture, Kyodo News reported on Sunday, citing the local Minamiuonuma Police Station.
The man was last seen snowboarding alone after parting ways with two friends earlier in the day, Television Niigata Network said. When he did not return by 5pm, his friends alerted staff at the resort, prompting a search by its ski patrol, police and the fire department.
Hong Kong residents made 1.84 million departure trips between Thursday last week and the second day of the Easter break, representing a 10 per cent increase from the same period last year.
Figures from the Immigration Department highlighted an increase from 2024, and a 20 per cent rise from the 1.4 million trips recorded in 2018, before the 2019 social unrest and the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The search concluded the following morning when the man, surnamed Lam, was discovered near the summit of a mountain around 7.20am. He was found off the designated course, head down near a hollow area around a tree – known as a “tree hole” – in a forest."

Stewart has become a big player in thoroughbred breeding and racing worldwide under the banner of Resolute Racing in recent years, including the acquisition of a majority share in Goliath last year.
The Francis-Henri Graffard-trained gelding caught Stewart’s attention after his upset win in a star-studded Group One King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes (2,392m) at Ascot last July.
Goliath won the Group Two Prix du Conseil de Paris (2,200m) at his following start in October before running sixth in November’s Group One Japan Cup (2,400m).
With Hong Kong champion Romantic Warrior resting after an arduous Middle Eastern campaign and multiple Group One winner Dubai Honour absent, Goliath will be the QE II Cup’s star attraction.
“He’s already at Sha Tin and seems in great shape,” Stewart told the Jockey Club.
“At this stage in his career he’s the ideal horse to travel the world and we’ve had this race in mind for him for a long time.
“As I’m building my stable, competing internationally is at the top of my agenda. The Hong Kong fans are so passionate and it’s good for them to get the chance to see him. I tell my trainers I’m not interested in prize money – I just want to run in the best races.
The beast has arrived in Hong Kong @HKJC_Racing and is ready to pound the competition! GOLIATH! pic.twitter.com/UcD0JIuT0t
“It’s a shame some of the bigger names won’t be turning up, but it will still be a competitive race as you always have to take the Japanese horses seriously and the local horses deserve respect.
“Christophe (Soumillon) is a world-class rider and he and Francis will sit down and talk about how they want the race to go during the week. We think he could have been ridden more positively in the Japan Cup.”
Goliath arrived in Hong Kong on Saturday morning, while the last of the international raiders for FWD Champions Day arrived on Sunday – Japan’s Satono Reve and Tastiera and Bahrain’s Goemon.
Fresh from a last-start Group One triumph in the Takamatsunomiya Kinen (1,200m) at Chukyo, Satono Reve faces a rematch with Ka Ying Rising in the Group One Chairman’s Sprint Prize (1,200m) after running third to Hong Kong’s star sprinter in the Group One Hong Kong Sprint (1,200m) last December.
Tastiera clashes with Goliath in the QE II Cup, while Goemon takes on the likes of Voyage Bubble and Mr Brightside in a strong edition of the Group One Champions Mile.
David Hayes lauded Ellis Wong Chi-wang for his perfect ride when the apprentice booted home Solid Shalaa in Sunday’s Class Four Cheung Shan Handicap (1,200m).
Wong settled Solid Shalaa just behind midfield on the inside rail from gate six and came off the inside approaching the turn to make his run.
While Zac Purton shot Fun N Fun Together clear at the 250m to establish a handy lead, Solid Shalaa sprouted wings to edge past that galloper late for a neck victory.
“You can’t complain when they go on the inside on the dirt, peel out in the straight and win – really good ride,” Hayes said after Wong notched his seventh win of the term.
“I think he tries hard, he’s got a seven-pound allowance and he’s getting stronger as the months go on. So he’ll keep riding winners.”
Solid Shalaa went one better than his first-up run when a close second to California Star.
The son of Shalaa didn’t race for almost a year after injuring both fore suspensory ligaments last July and his left fore humeral bone last November.
“The Conghua boys did a really good job because he had one year off and now the leg, touch wood, is really good,” Hayes said.
“We’ll keep him on the dirt and he’ll keep winning.”
Young jockey Luke Ferraris sailed past his career-best haul of wins for a season after lifting Bright Inheritance to victory in the Class Four Kowloon Tsai Handicap (1,600m).
Ferraris hugged the inside rail on Bright Inheritance before coming off the fence to launch a powerful run in the straight, with the Dennis Yip Chor-hong-trained gelding beating Happy Universe by a length.
Ferraris, 23, eclipsed his previous best of 35 wins in 2022-23 with 24 meetings left this term.
“It’s ticking along OK,” he said. “It’s good to get on the board for Dennis. It’s taken me a while to ride him a winner, but never late than never. He had the horse in great condition.”"

Brown-lamped late in betting from $16 to $6.2, the Tony Cruz-trained gelding notched his fourth win of the season after a fading 11th behind Cap Ferrat in last month’s Derby.
Camped behind a solid speed set by Voyage Samurai, Californiatotality looked in trouble approaching the turn when coming under pressure and failing to respond to Alexis Badel’s urgings.
However, he kept on willingly down the centre of the track to prevail over Steps Ahead and Pray For Mir in a thrilling three-way finish.
Three-way finish! 📸

“I think it’s the second or third time he’s beaten that horse, Pray For Mir,” Cruz said after Californiatotality relished a light weight of just 116 pounds to win by a short head.
“Today you can see the lightweights are winning. It’s a fast track today. First, second, third, even fourth – it was all the lightweights coming in.
“I think 1,800’s perfect for him – light weight, even better.”
While the strength of this year’s Derby crop has been questioned, the form was given a little boost by Californiatotality, Steps Ahead and Bundle Award, who had excuses when a beaten $2 favourite in the Hong Kong Lions Cup.
Jockey Zac Purton told stewards he intended to settle Bundle Award in a more prominent position, but the John Size-trained gelding’s slow start forced him back to third last.
The son of Shamus Award was disappointed for clear running between two runners near the 250m and had difficulty obtaining a clear run over the final 150m.
Californiatotality notched his fourth win of the season and sixth overall from 19 starts.
Cruz said the son of Zoustar will not make the leap to Group Three level in next month’s Queen Mother Memorial Cup (2,400m), but he could be a candidate for a late-season feature such as the Group Three Premier Plate (1,800m) in June.
Cruz’s likely Queen Mother Memorial Cup runners Winning Dragon, Five G Patch and La City Blanche ran seventh, eighth and last of 11 respectively behind Californiatotality on Sunday.
Elsewhere on Sunday’s card, punters were on the money again when the brown-lamped Moduleconstruction saluted in the Class Three Ngau Tau Kok Handicap (1,200m).
Firming late from $23 to $10, the Francis Lui Kin-wai-trained gelding sat outside of the lead and kept on strongly under Lyle Hewitson to beat Super Infinity by a neck.
Super training performance, Francis Lui! 👊

Moduleconstruction has overcome two major injuries – a tendon injury in December 2023 and suspensory ligament injury last September – to return to the winners’ list.
“He’s had bad injuries twice, but his last run [when fourth to Geneva] was impressive and I think today it’s good for the front-runners,” Lui said.
“He likes to go out in front.”
Meanwhile, Cruz was fined HK$15,000 on Sunday for breaching the Trainers’ Handbook Regulation when “during a compliance check conducted in his stable on February 25 he was found in his possession medication that had not been approved by the Club’s Veterinary Departments”.
Stewards also suspended Karis Teetan and James Orman each for one meeting for careless riding."

Having soared past Whyte’s record of 1,813 Hong Kong wins in January, Purton added another to his list of achievements when he eclipsed the benchmark of wins on Sha Tin’s all-weather track.
The seven-time champion Hong Kong jockey booted home Meepmeep, Chill Kaka and Bottomuptogether on the dirt to lift his career tally to 165 wins on the surface. Whyte held the record with 163 wins.
“It’s good to tick that off. It’s a track where you need a horse that likes it and is in form,” Purton said.
There's the four-timer! 🙌

“When they are in form, it really helps. I like ticking those boxes off, another one.”
Purton struck top form at the perfect time as he prepares for a big Champions Day assault on Sunday, headlined by the ride on superstar sprinter Ka Ying Rising in the Group One Chairman’s Sprint Prize (1,200m).
The Australian rider will also be aboard in-form New Zealand galloper El Vencedor in the Group One QE II Cup (2,000m) and Galaxy Patch in the Group One Champions Mile.
Racing on dirt for the first time, Bottomuptogether maintained his consistent form from the turf to make all in the Class Two Kowloon Bay Handicap (1,200m).
Sent off the $5.45 second favourite, the Frankie Lor Fu-chuen-trained gelding fired to the front from gate four and was never headed when blitzing his rivals by two and a quarter lengths.
Sing Dragon, who was heavily backed into $2.9 favouritism, ran on for second ahead of Beauty Waves, who could back up in the Chairman’s Sprint Prize after a solid dirt debut.
Unbeaten from his first three starts, Bottomuptogether has also notched a Happy Valley win and three seconds in a consistent campaign this term.
“Everyone said he trialled six times on the dirt for four wins and two seconds, but sometimes we don’t know whether they can win in a race on the dirt,” Lor said.
“He had a good draw and went forward to lead on his own. Zac said he went smoothly and won easily. There aren’t many dirt races in Hong Kong, so we’ll maybe look at the turf at Sha Tin or Happy Valley next.”
John Size’s Meepmeep started Purton’s bumper day with a first win at start 13 in the Class Five Luk Wu Handicap (1,650m), while Ricky Yiu Poon-fai’s Chill Kaka made it back-to-back wins with a tough performance in the Class Four Ma Tau Kok Handicap (1,650m).
Purton’s other winner, Top Dragon, broke the Class Four 1,400m record at Sha Tin with a breakthrough success in the Tsing Lung Tau Handicap.
After two close seconds from his first four starts, the Chris So Wai-yin-trained gelding delivered on his potential with an effortless victory by two and a quarter lengths.
“He’s got ability, he’s only three-years-old and I always tell the owners he’s a good horse,” So said after Top Dragon lowered Perfect Pair’s 2020 class record by 0.04 seconds.
“He’s just needed a bit of time. So far, in five starts, he’s won and run two seconds and we knew that he’s got ability, but I didn’t want to rush him.”
Lor finished with a double after the progressive South Star won the final race under Andrea Atzeni, who notched a brace of his own after also booting home the Size-trained Must Go. Trainers’ championship leader Size moved to 50 wins for the term after also preparing a double."

Eastern stayed on course to retain the Hong Kong FA Cup as they overcame Tai Po 2-1 in a tight and tense semi-final on Sunday – but their coach Roberto Losada was still an unhappy man.
Striker Noah Baffoe scored the winning goal from the penalty spot at Mong Kok Stadium, after his first-half opener had been cancelled out by Michel Renner.
But Losada said he was “very angry” with his players, feeling they had been outworked by a Tai Po team who lost a Sapling Cup semi-final on penalties to Lee Man four days earlier.
“In the first half, it looked like we played 120 minutes on Wednesday, not them,” said Losada, who also questioned the 3pm kick-off time on a sweltering day.
“They were more eager to run and they deserved to win. They played with passion and heart. We were walking. I’m very angry.”
Baffoe gave Eastern a controversial lead after 29 minutes. He gathered Leung Kwun-chung’s forward pass before dumping Gabriel Cividini to the ground and placing a composed finish over onrushing keeper Tse Ka-wing. Defender Cividini and his teammates were incandescent when the goal was awarded following a lengthy VAR check."

Growing up in the 1990s in Oakland, in the US state of California, director Ryan Coogler was fuelled by his city’s magnetic hip-hop scene and artists such as Digital Underground, 2Pac and E-40.
But it was Bay Area heavy metal legends Metallica who helped provide a structure for his new movie Sinners, the director says over a Zoom call from Chicago.
Coogler says he had Metallica on his mind when he was laying out the story’s rhythms and beats.
“One” is the signature song from the band’s 1988 album, …And Justice For All. “It starts off with almost like an easy-listening solo, you know what I’m saying? And then it just goes bats*** insane, in a way you could have never seen coming – and at the same time, it felt like it was going there all along,” Coogler says. “The movie’s basically that.”"

Digital wallets are on track to become the dominant payment method in Hong Kong by 2030, accounting for nearly half of all online and in-store transactions, marking a significant shift away from traditional credit card payments, according to a new report.
Digital wallets – typically smartphone-enabled payment systems run by technology companies such as Google and Apple – are projected to account for 45 per cent of the city’s online transaction value and 48 per cent of point-of-sale (POS) transactions at bricks-and-mortar shops within the next five years, according to the 2025 Global Payments Report published by Worldpay.
The direct use of credit cards, both online and in-person, is expected to decline to 32 per cent, down from 39 per cent of online spending and 45 per cent of POS transaction value in 2024, the London-based payment processing company said. A decade ago, those figures were 62 per cent and 56 per cent, respectively.
The surge in digital wallet adoption is largely attributed to rising smartphone usage among consumers, according to Daniel So, head of business development for Hong Kong at Worldpay.
“This trend underscores the inevitability of payment technologies becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives,” So said. “We see downtrends in credit card usage compared to the growing adoption of digital wallets.”"

Malaysian durian growers are expected to expand their market share in China this year, buoyed by local consumers’ growing appetite for fresh, naturally ripened fruit.
The Southeast Asian nation’s durian exports to China have surged this year as a result of a steady supply and improved logistics, food processors and traders said on Friday.
“Fresh durians, which are transported to China by air within 48 hours of pickup, are well-received by affluent Chinese consumers,” said Guo Min, deputy marketing director with fresh fruit distributor Joy Wing Mau’s China operations. “Our Malaysian suppliers are able to increase exports of the fruit by 30 per cent this year, which has largely boosted our confidence in propelling sales here.”
Vivian Wang, marketing director at Dole Asia Holdings, echoed the sentiment.
“Fresh durians were among the fastest-growing fruits imported to China,” she said. “It creates big opportunities for growers in Malaysia.”

Unlike Thailand and Vietnam, where pre-cutting methods are common, Malaysian durians are typically allowed to ripen naturally on the tree before they fall and are collected by farmers."

The shop sign reads “Happy Valley Turf Club”, calling to mind the Hong Kong neighbourhood of the same name that is known for its racecourse.

Hong Kong has continued its build-up to November’s National Games, which it will co-host, by staging a test event for beach volleyball at Victoria Park this weekend.
Lo Wai-yan, previously a member of the Hong Kong team who finished ninth at the Asian Games in Hangzhou two years ago, said the park was a good choice of venue, even if it involved transporting sand to the middle of a city that has an abundance of real beaches.
“Victoria Park has a lot of experience,” she said on Saturday, citing the Hong Kong Tennis Open and an international beach volleyball event in 2005.

The situation has forced office landlords to focus on retaining their existing customers at the expense of softer rents, the consultancy said. Rents on prime office space, which fell at a faster pace last quarter, may come under further pressure as the firm forecast region-wide supply to increase by 5.7 per cent this year to about 200 million square metres (2.15 billion sq ft).
US President Donald Trump imposed cumulative tariffs of 145 per cent on Chinese goods this month, starting off a trade war with its long-standing trade partners. China, which raised its tariffs on US goods to 125 per cent, now faces up to a 245 per cent levy on its exports to the US. Both sides are waiting on each other to negotiate, causing a stalemate.
“As Trump’s tariffs continue to evolve, the full economic impact of the new measures will take time to unfold,” Tim Armstrong, global head of occupier strategy and solutions at Knight Frank, said in a report last week. “Forward-looking expectations will inevitably turn more cautious as a new modus operandi for the global economy emerges.”

Boom, bust and borrow: Has China’s housing market tanked?
As companies in the region reassess the tariffs and their impact on headcounts, Armstrong expects decision makers to delay significant real estate commitments.
“This trend is driving a stronger focus on lease renewals, particularly for those who have moved into higher-quality buildings in the past few years and prompting occupiers to explore flexible spaces and shorter lease terms,” he added."

The company’s adoption of AI ties into China’s efforts to dominate the global video-gaming arena. Over the past couple of decades, the sector has transformed into a cultural and economic juggernaut.
Tang said one goal of AI adoption is to free up time for the team of around 1,200 to focus on more creative work. Hero Esports has developed its own AI toolkit to streamline various production workflows such as setting timelines, automating camera work and creating highlight reels."

The three-day meeting is doubling as a National Games test event, and there was a notable police and security presence inside and outside Hong Kong Velodrome in Tseung Kwan O.
A hardy core of around 150 fans showed up to watch the action, which unfolded on a day when Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu hosted Gao Zhidan, director of the General Administration of Sport of China, at his official residence to exchange views on preparations for the Games.
Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law Shuk-pui also attended the meeting at Government House, during which Lee said Hong Kong would continue to conduct test events to ensure the city’s readiness.
On the track, Lee, Mow and To delivered performances that ignited optimism for November’s competition, while the city’s women’s and men’s sprint teams won silver and bronze, respectively.
“They all showed fighting spirit, which I loved,” said head coach Hervé Dagorne. “You could see Ceci and Ching-yin chasing points, so that’s positive.”"

Alibaba first revealed Damo Panda, which is designed to identify pancreatic cancer, in November 2023 in a paper published in the medical journal Nature Medicine. The tool can effectively detect early-stage malignancies in asymptomatic patients, according to the paper.
Panda is a deep learning model trained on abdominal non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scans of 3,208 pancreatic cancer patients. Testing showed a 34.1 per cent higher sensitivity than radiologists in identifying the disease, Damo researchers said at the time.
Alibaba has already deployed Damo Panda in trials across China, the company said on Thursday. It has screened 40,000 people at a hospital in the eastern city of Ningbo, where it identified six early-stage cases, including two missed by routine exams, the company said last month."

Chinese debutant Lei Peifan caused a huge shock on the first day of the World Snooker Championship as he stunned defending champion Kyren Wilson 10-9 at Sheffield’s Crucible Theatre.
Wilson’s first-round exit means that the “Crucible Curse” has struck again, with no first-time winner having been able to retain their world crown since the tournament moved to the venue in 1977.
World No 39 Lei, one of a record 10 Chinese players in this year’s draw, looked down and out early on. England’s Wilson, who had already won four titles this season, reeled off six frames in a row to lead 6-2 in the best-of-19 frame duel.
But the ice-cool Lei, who had to come through qualifying, stormed back in astonishing fashion to win seven frames in succession late on Saturday local time as Wilson lost his way.
World No 2 Wilson finally stopped the rot and levelled for 9-9 to set up a decider, but Lei took his chance in the final frame, a composed break of 66 completing one of the biggest shocks in the tournament’s history."

“Happy Easter!” is a wish that will be articulated by many this Sunday, certainly by those observing the celebration of the resurrection of Jesus – with both Western (Gregorian) and Orthodox Easter being celebrated on the same day this year.
What is interesting is that among the European languages, the word “Easter” is only found in English and German, while in other Germanic languages and most European languages, the word for the festival is derived from the corresponding word for “Passover”.
Passover is the Jewish festival commemorating the liberation of the Israelites in ancient Egypt after the Tenth Plague – when the Angel of Death killed all the firstborns in Egypt including the Pharoah’s, but passed over the homes of Israelites whose door posts had, on God’s command, been smeared with lamb’s blood.
The linguistic environment of the early Christian era encompassed a few significant languages.
These included Aramaic, a northwest Semitic language which was a long-standing literary and liturgical language and the lingua franca of the ancient Near East by the time of Jesus; and Hebrew, the dominant language of the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament and the language of the Jews.
Other significant languages were Greek, the language of the Septuagint – a pre-Christian translation of the Hebrew Bible, the original language of the New Testament and the lingua franca of Levant at the time; and Latin, the language of the Roman Empire and soon an important language of the Christian Church."

Watching Hong Kong aerialist Jimmy Wong in action is a dizzying experience.
His gravity-defying acts take him high off the stage, where he might do something like rapidly spin while clinging to a lone strap with just one arm.
Earlier this month, 39-year-old Wong, who emigrated from Hong Kong to the UK two years ago, appeared on Britain’s Got Talent in a mesmerising performance that showed off his skills.
Wong’s audition on the long-running talent show was a mix of acrobatics and water dancing that had some audience members on their feet. His act received a “yes” vote from all four judges, allowing him to proceed to the next round.
“It is a high-stress environment for performers but the audience was really supportive,” Wong says of his audition that was taped in October."

Navigating bedtime with a teenager is, in many homes, a nightly battle with a constant refrain: “Get off your phone and go to bed!”
Research shows that today’s teenagers are more sleep-deprived than ever before. Adolescents need between eight and 10 hours of sleep, according to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.
But nearly 80 per cent of American teenagers are not getting that, and experts say it is affecting important areas like mental health and school attendance.
Bedtime routines are not just for toddlers. Teenagers need them too, says Denise Pope, an expert on child development and a senior lecturer at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Education, in the US state of California.
Experts in adolescent sleep say a few small changes to how parents and teens approach sleep can make a dramatic difference. Here is their advice.

BC Rangers reached a second FA Cup final in three seasons by beating Hong Kong Football Club 4-1 at Mong Kok Stadium on Saturday.
They were in full control of their semi-final by half-time thanks to a trio of similarly worked goals as their game plan of playing through Football’s Club high line paid off, with Lau Chi-lok, Li Wing-ho and Maxwell Ansah the scorers.
HKFC replied after the interval through Leo, but Guilherme Biteco completed their miserable afternoon with a sublime fourth.
Rangers will face the winner of Sunday’s second semi-final between Eastern and Tai Po on May 31, and man-of-the-match Biteco was hoping for the former – otherwise the terms of his loan from Tai Po will prevent him playing.

A rat-a-tat percussion and keyboard riff, and Youssou N’Dour’s voice tore through the dark Dakar sky, as the world music legend geared up to do what he does best: rock through the night.
With a new album out and a world tour starting this week, the Senegalese icon and Grammy Award winner – who confesses he “couldn’t live without music” – shows no signs of slowing down despite his 45 years in show business.
“Let’s rock,” he barked to his 12-piece band Super Etoile an hour before midnight, before the strains of one of their last pre-tour rehearsals rang out well into the small hours.
Five years after his last album, N’Dour’s latest record, Eclairer Le Monde – Light The World, voices his commitment to human rights and gives a place of honour to traditional African instruments.
“It’s been nothing but a blast!” says the 65-year-old of his decades in music.
In that time he has cut dozens of gold discs and laid down tracks with the likes of Peter Gabriel, Paul Simon, Sting, Manu Dibango and Neneh Cherry."

Let us cut to the chase here: if you had followed my advice in the previous two FPL articles, you would have scored over 113 points from my tips alone.
Building on the 63 points I scored in Gameweek 31, I bagged an additional 93 points in Double Gameweek 32, which concluded with Newcastle’s 5-0 demolishing of Crystal Palace on Wednesday night.

Strawberries are the newest Seoul souvenir – as proven by the crowds of tourists lining up for them at western Seoul’s Mangwon Market.
“The love for strawberries is a recent phenomenon,” said a fruit seller. “And most of [the customers] are Asian tourists.”
According to Statistics Korea, strawberry exports jumped from US$32 million in 2016 to US$69 million in 2024, making them the country’s third most exported fresh agricultural product after paprika and pears."

While there are questions about the strength of this year’s Derby, won in an upset by maiden galloper Cap Ferrat, Steps Ahead and Bundle Award will be joined by Californiatotality in attempting to boost the form from the city’s biggest race.
Rubylot was the first four-year-old to reappear from the Derby, but he finished eighth of nine runners behind Divano last Sunday in what was more of a warm-up run for the Group One QE II Cup (2,000m) next weekend.
Steps Ahead was sent out an $82 roughie in the Derby and was only beaten two and a half lengths in ninth, despite running into trouble twice in the straight.

The Francis Lui Kin-wai-trained gelding was a Class Three winner at the course and distance of Sunday’s race in February and a solid fifth to Rubylot in the Classic Cup (1,800m) before the Derby.
“He’ll be having his first run back from the four-year-old series. In the Classic Cup and Derby he ran quite well,” jockey Lyle Hewitson said.
“He probably should have finished closer if he had have got more room in the straight, so I was happy with him.”
While Steps Ahead drops to a career-low 118 pounds on Sunday, the son of Written By has to overcome barrier 10 in a competitive field of 11.
Champion jockey Zac Purton will partner Bundle Award for the first time, with the John Size-trained gelding fresh from a two-length seventh in the Derby.
The former Australian galloper won his previous start, a Class Two over 1,800m, and a 1,400m race in January.
“Obviously he won well two starts back over the track and distance,” Purton said.
“He ran a nice race in the Derby, he gets in well into this race with a light weight [121 pounds] and he’s drawn well [barrier three], so he’ll be a chance.”
Californiatotality will be out to bounce back from a his 11th behind Cap Ferrat on March 23.
The Tony Cruz-trained gelding is a three-time winner this term, including two at the course and distance of Sunday’s race, and could be dangerous with just 116 pounds.
Alexis Badel will ride Californiatotality, who has drawn gate five.
Elsewhere on Sunday’s 10-race card, Hewitson will bid to repay the faith shown by Lui and Gallant Epoch’s connections in the Class Four Tsing Lung Tau Handicap (1,400m).
“I erred in judgment last time, so it’s nice that I got the opportunity again and hopefully we get back to winning ways,” the South African jockey said of Gallant Epoch’s last-start 12th at Happy Valley when he faded after being pushed forward early to lead.
“He has become quite a funny horse. I don’t think he’s putting it all in but once he gets control of a race, then he’s quite good.
“Hopefully he can do that again and be strong off the front. It looks a competitive race.”
Gallant Epoch made all to brilliantly score by two lengths at Sha Tin three starts ago."

Villagers, many sharing the surname Liang, set up stalls near his childhood home to sell souvenirs and drinks, including zhuangyuan sugar cane juice – an homage to the ancient title given to top scorers of the imperial examination. Like Liang, many past scholars had risen from humble beginnings to achieve fame and fortune through sheer intellectual excellence.
“China can’t always be a follower,” Liang said in an interview with Chinese media outlet 36Kr in 2024.
When Liang was born to a primary school teacher in 1985, China had yet to emerge from the shadow of a planned economy. It had a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of US$300, limited financial services and no stock market.

Lor, who has a runner in each of the weekend’s races, will hope Voyage Samurai is ready for the 1,800m of the Class Two Hong Kong Lions Cup.
An all-the-way winner over a mile last start, Voyage Samurai finds himself in a strong contest featuring the likes of Five G Patch, Helene Feeling, La City Blanche, Winning Dragon and Bundle Award.
“I think he can handle the 1,800m because he has a big stride and he can keep on well on the speed. Since we put the blinkers on, he has improved,” said Lor of his five-year-old, who has sported blinkers in his past three starts for a fourth, a second and a win.

Bottomuptogether also begins from barrier four in the Class Two Kowloon Bay Handicap (1,200m) as he tackles Sha Tin’s all-weather track for the first time.
Successful in the grade over the Happy Valley 1,000m three starts back, Bottomuptogether has done just about everything but win over six furlongs at Sha Tin this season.
After three seconds and a third over the turf 1,200m, Lor has opted to roll the dice on the dirt.

Zac Purton sticks with the four-year-old son of Shamus Award and they do battle with the likes of Copartner Prance, Beauty Waves and Stellar Express.
“He usually trials very well on the dirt. He can lead or he can sit second. There aren’t too many Class Two 1,000m or 1,200m races, so we need to try the dirt. He’s in good form,” said Lor, who has had a winner at the past five Sha Tin meetings.
One of the gallopers successful in that streak was South Star, who will look to make it two victories on the bounce in Sunday’s Class Three Ho Chung River Handicap (1,400m).
A convincing winner at the course and distance on March 30, South Star steps up in grade and will again be partnered by Andrea Atzeni.

Triumphant More is another in-form galloper among Lor’s full weekend book, with the four-year-old chasing a fourth win of his debut season in the Class Three Ngau Tau Kok Handicap (1,200m).
Second at the course and distance last start, Triumphant More looks well placed to help Lor, who sits seventh in the trainers’ premiership, add to his 35 victories so far this campaign.
The affable handler also saddles up Silver Destiny, Dreaming Winner, Fun N Fun Together, Beauty Live, Lucky Impact and Victory Moments this weekend.
Looking forward, Lor expects to have two runners on Champions Day next weekend – Lucky With You in the Group One Chairman’s Sprint Prize (1,200m) and Happy Together in the Group One Champions Mile.

Chloe Leung Wing-yee will aim for the next step on her redemptive arc at the Hong Kong International Track Cup, as head coach Herve Dagorne revealed he was trying to woo Australian great Bradley McGee for a role with the city squad.
The three-day track cup, which begins on Saturday, is doubling as a test event for November’s National Games at the same venue.
Dagorne said McGee, who claimed 2004 Olympic team pursuit gold, and won two track world titles as well as two stages of the Tour de France, would attend Monday’s final day at Hong Kong Velodrome to “have a look” at the local set-up.
“I want to convince him [to work with us] for the short term, then, if he’s keen, he can go for a longer-term job,” said Dagorne, whose vision is for McGee to work “in parallel” with a still-to-be-appointed track endurance coach.
“[McGee] is a really good coach – I will introduce him to the cycling association, and show him the facilities,” Dagorne added.
McGee is currently high performance coach adviser at the New South Wales Institute of Sport. Previously, he was the Australian men’s team road cycling head coach, before becoming the country’s national road technical director."

I had minor surgery last week to remove a lipoma, which had quietly made a home for itself on my right shoulder several years ago. Embedded just beneath the skin like one half of a ping pong ball, the benign lump of fat tissue had not affected my well-being in any discernible way.
But I decided that I had seen enough of that offending growth in the mirror and I wanted it removed.
A couple of medical scans and consultations later, I lay supine in a cavernous, blindingly lit operating theatre, while a team of doctors and nurses cut into me.
Having opted for local anaesthesia, I was conscious throughout the 30-minute procedure. Though the surgeons kept assuring me that I was “doing very well”, I was in a silent state of panic.
It was not the pain. There was none, because the anaesthesia did its wonderful magic. But playing in my head on repeat were the gory online videos of lipoma surgeries, which I was stupid enough to watch in the days leading up to my own."

South Korean actor Simon Lee was stunned when he saw his likeness – at times as a gynaecologist or a surgeon – being used to promote questionable health cures on TikTok and Instagram.
He is one of scores of people who licensed their image to AI marketing companies and then ended up with the unpleasant surprise of seeing themselves featured in deepfakes, dubious adverts or even political propaganda.
“If it was a nice advertisement, it would’ve been fine to me. But obviously it is such a scam,” he says, adding that the terms of his contract prevented him from getting the videos removed.
AI technology – cheaper than filming actors but more realistic than an entirely AI-generated avatar – allows firms to build catalogues of digital models to appear in videos that mostly promote products or services."

Weight-loss stories often begin with a moment of epiphany, which is then followed by an intense period of discipline and perseverance – sometimes measured in months, sometimes in years.
For Singaporean chef Han Li-guang, who has lost more than 30kg (66 pounds) since 2022, it has been a slow, steady race to the finish line. Even now, he continues to work out for two hours at a time, six days a week, to set himself up for the day.
“Going to the gym helps me clear my mind, to start fresh. It sets my mood in the right direction as well,” Han says.
Han, who is mostly self-taught but who has worked in classical French kitchens, was driven by a desire to elevate his heritage.
He deconstructs hawker stall staples like rojak, a salad dish of Javanese origin, and chilli crab into avant-garde masterpieces – think edible “soil” made from dried shrimp, or ice cream infused with tangy crab essence."

Cheung Ka-long has given his clearest indication yet that he will attempt to become the first man to win three Olympic foil fencing golds in a row at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.
Hong Kong’s greatest Olympian, Cheung had previously voiced concerns over whether he could withstand four more years of training and competition.
However, after claiming his fourth successive “best of the best” honour at the Cathay 2024 Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards on Thursday, Cheung told the Post he was managing his body with a view to extending his extraordinary Olympic supremacy.
The world championships in Tbilisi, Georgia in July is the next major competition in the 27-year-old’s diary. He said he would be “trying to win and not just playing around”, but had realised he needed to pace himself to get through another Olympic cycle.
“I am still going to train, but since the Olympics I have been more relaxed,” Cheung said. “I have been quite tired for the past four years. I spoke to my coach [Greg Koenig] about it; I want to enjoy fencing and not push too hard.
“We know another four years are coming and we have to fight one more time against the strongest opponents in the Olympics.”"

Siobhan Haughey has said she hopes to see a top-level swimming arena built in Hong Kong before she eventually retires, because she still holds ambitions of competing in her hometown.
Asked what the city’s next major sporting development should be after last month’s opening of the state-of-the-art Kai Tak Sports Park, the four-time Olympic medallist proposed an elite aquatics facility, adding that she craved the chance to swim in one.
How many years Hong Kong has to make Haughey’s wish come true is still to be determined, with the 27-year-old taking a wait-and-see approach to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.
Last Saturday, she began her preparations for the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore in July and August, returning from a three-month break with 100 metres breaststroke victory in Hong Kong’s Long Course Swimming Time Trial. It was held behind closed doors at Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI).
“I’m focusing on the Mare Nostrum [Swim Tour in May], the world championships and maybe the National Games [in November], then I’ll go from there,” Haughey told the Post.
“Three years is a very long time to plan. I don’t want to say I’m fully committed to Los Angeles yet. After this year, I will have a better sense of where I am, physically and mentally.”"

According to the official Xinhua news agency, Huang met He Lifeng, the Chinese vice-premier in charge of US-China trade talks, on Thursday. Xinhua quoted Huang as saying that Nvidia would deepen its presence in the Chinese market because of its positive outlook on China’s economic prospects.
The vice-premier told Huang that China welcomes US businesses, including Nvidia, to invest in the country to showcase their “industrial advantages and capabilities”, according to the brief statement from Xinhua.
Huang was accompanied on his visit by Jay Puri, executive vice-president for Nvidia’s global business, and Raymond Teh, Nvidia’s vice-president of sales and marketing for the Asia-Pacific region. Their “mission” was to reassure Chinese officials and clients that the company intends to maintain business ties despite the US restrictions, according to Su Lian Jye, chief analyst at research firm Omdia.

Hong Kong men’s boss Chan Hon-kei said rivals Fogo were “pretty much the best team in the tournament” after an opening day at the Lacrosse Open on Friday that saw both of the city’s sides earn maximum points.
The hosts opened with a 23-2 victory over Chengdu University before overcoming Singapore 9-5 in a thrilling match, which they threatened to lose with the two sides level at 5-5 at point.
Chan said he hoped the show of character to get the eventual win would help the team improve as the tournament progressed.
“The second match was a good learning curve for us,” he said. “[The Hong Kong players] lost their pace in the middle. We are adjusting to the contest and got caught out a lot.”
Chan also coaches the city’s under-20 side and said he saw their match with Fogo, which they lost 23-0, as a chance to gain valuable experience.
Despite Fogo opening with a surprise 10-9 defeat by SLDL, Chan still regarded the Japanese outfit as the benchmark side."

With the exception of a few words, the notices are nearly identical down to their structure and punctuation.
In its opening paragraph, Shein said, “Since we began serving US shoppers, our goal has been simple: to offer great fashion at affordable prices while creating a positive impact in the communities we serve.” Temu opened with the same paragraph, but replaced the word “fashion” with “product”.

This is the latest instalment in a feature series reflecting on instances of East meets West in world cinema, including China-US co-productions.
Australian cinema has never been the most outward-looking. Its greatest films tend to lean into national stereotypes, and its greatest stars tend to leave for Hollywood.
In 2008, however, the government signed a co-production treaty with China, which was fast becoming one of the biggest film markets in the world. This resulted in underperforming efforts such as the 2008 drama The Children of Huang Shi and the 2011 family film The Dragon Pearl, both of which were set in China.
Having found a lucrative niche, director Kimble Rendall attempted to repeat the trick with 2018’s Guardians of the Tomb, also known as Nest and 7 Guardians of the Tomb."

“Every time I play, I hear so much cheering and support. Of course, I think it can make me go all out to play for every point in the game."

An aid to digestion, it goes well with seafood and in biscotti
I love the intense, licorice-y flavour of aniseed, although it’s not a spice everyone appreciates. To me, it seems a little old-fashioned, perhaps because of the vintage-looking packaging of Flavigny violet or rose pastilles. At the centre of each hard, round bonbon is a whole aniseed.
Aniseed, also known as anise seed, is also one of the ingredients in the Indian spice and sugar mix known as mukhwas, which is eaten after meals.
In addition to aiding digestion, aniseed is used in alternative medicine to control spasms, stimulate the appetite and relieve cough and lung problems. It’s similar in flavour to star anise, although the latter is much stronger.
The flavour of aniseed goes well with sweet and savoury dishes, especially seafood. When making a seafood stew or soup, add a shot of aniseed liquor to the liquid to give the dish a gentle licorice perfume. If you don’t have aniseed liquor, add a teaspoonful of the spice when you’re cooking the onions, garlic and other aromatics.
I also love aniseed biscotti, to which I add grated orange zest."

Sunac China Holdings has reached an agreement with key creditors to restructure US$9.6 billion in offshore debt, marking another step forward for the country’s beleaguered home builders as the property market begins to show signs of stabilisation.
The Beijing-based developer entered into a restructuring support agreement with creditors holding around US$1.3 billion in principal, while another group of creditors with over US$1 billion in debt has also expressed support and was in the process of signing off on the deal, Sunac said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange late on Thursday.
The two groups of creditors held about 26 per cent of Sunac’s existing debt, it added.
Under the agreement, creditors can choose to receive two types of mandatory convertible bonds (MCBs). MCB 1 will be converted into ordinary shares at HK$6.8 (US$0.9) per share when the restructuring takes effect, and MCB 2 will be converted 18 months later at HK$3.85 per share. Creditors could also opt for a combination of the two bonds, with the proportion of MCB 2 capped at 25 per cent.

Intel has also promoted networking chip chief Sachin Katti to be chief technology officer and artificial intelligence chief, according to the memo.
The leadership changes are the first major move under Tan, who took the top job last month, to turn around the venerable Silicon Valley chipmaker after years of problems. Intel’s data centre and AI chip group, as well as its personal-computer chip group, will report directly to him.
They previously were overseen by Michelle Johnston Holthaus, who remains chief executive of Intel products and whose work will expand to new areas.
“I want to roll up my sleeves with the engineering and product teams so I can learn what’s needed to strengthen our solutions,” Tan wrote. “As Michelle and I drive this work, we plan to evolve and expand her role with more details to come in the future.”
The shake-up by Tan, who has promised a leaner version of the storied American chipmaker, follows an extended period of turmoil at Santa Clara, California-based Intel."

There was a time when gourmet European cheese was an uncommon ingredient in Hong Kong restaurants. The assumption was that local diners did not like cheese, finding it unappealing, expensive and stinky – and certainly not the preferred post-dinner alternative to dessert. Plus, it was presumed that Asians were mostly lactose intolerant.
Jeremy Evrard set out to change that. As the general manager of fine dining restaurant Caprice when the Four Seasons Hong Kong opened in 2005, the Frenchman defied convention and introduced artisan cheeses rarely – if ever – tasted in the city.
“When I arrived five years ago, everybody told me, ‘Forget about cheese, nobody eats cheese in Hong Kong,’” he told the Post in 2010.
His curation of prized fromages and high service standard soon earned loyal admirers. Undoubtedly, it helped Caprice maintain its haute reputation and Michelin-star status over the years. He ended up working there for almost a decade.
“At the beginning, cheese was never part of the plan,” he says. “Caprice was supposed to be fine dining, going for Michelin stars. But the cheese cellar came along, and I was very lucky to be able to transform the place and express myself through this cheese discussion.”"

On Hong Kong’s ever-changing dining scene, new names continually pop up, bringing novel flavours and bold concepts. Exciting as each new restaurant or bar is, it’s hard not to feel a sense of nostalgia for those restaurants and bars that have left a mark on this city – places that brought something truly special and left behind unforgettable memories – but that have since disappeared.
“What I truly miss are Hong Kong’s vanishing old-school dai pai dongs, those iconic street kitchens that used to be everywhere,” says chef ArChan Chan.
In particular, Hong Kee in Kowloon Bay held a special place in her heart until its closure last year. “It was fast, fiery and full of life,” she adds. “Every table was abuzz with stories, unpretentious and deeply local.”
Hong Kee was known for its wok-fried clams served with black bean sauce and chilli, its salt and pepper squid and Chiu Chow favourites such as pig’s blood with garlic chives. For Chan, nothing could beat the rich, comforting lamb belly claypot, especially on a chilly winter night. She recalls fond visits with her parents and grandparents, with, “The sizzle of the wok, laughter all around, a cold beer in hand and tucking into a bowl of something soul-warming – this place was a gem.”
“Dai pai dongs like Hong Kee are more than places to eat, they are part of our neighbourhood and culture,” Chan reflects. “There are fewer now, and even fewer that still carry that same fire. Losing them feels like losing a piece of our collective memory.”"

Towering Eastern centre-back Aleksandar Mitrovic has promised a “war on the pitch” when his team clash with Tai Po in the Hong Kong FA Cup semi-finals on Sunday.
The tie at Mong Kok Stadium represents a renewal of hostilities, after the sides drew a ferocious top-of-the-table league encounter 3-3 last Sunday. Eastern need leaders Tai Po to slip up in at least one of their remaining four matches for any chance of a first title since 2016.
Their Cup destiny is in their own hands, however, and Mitrovic backed his team to prevail, provided they eradicate the types of individual errors that gifted Tai Po an early 2-0 advantage last week.
“We know how to play against Tai Po – if it wasn’t for some stupid mistakes [in the league game], we’d have won,” the 6ft 4in (1.93-metre) Mitrovic said.
“It’s going to be a war on the pitch, and I hope we knock them out.”
Mitrovic answered an emergency call from Eastern in January, after head coach Roberto Losada lost two defensive pillars in rapid succession. A knee injury ended Dani Almazan’s season, before Tamirlan Kozubaev transferred to Persita in Indonesia."

Bridgeway Prime Shop Fund Management, which invests in retail and shop lots in Hong Kong, has suffered a hit of about 30 per cent in three deals over the past two months as geopolitical tensions and diminished bets on rate cuts hurt prices and market sentiment.
The fund sold a ground-level shop at Tung Lee Mansion in Sai Ying Pun for HK$15.6 million (US$2 million) last week, founder Edwin Lee told the Post on Thursday. It purchased the asset for HK$24.5 million three years ago, according to Land Registry records.
Earlier this month, it sold a ground-level shop at One Eighty in Shau Kei Wan for HK$20.1 million, versus its average acquisition cost of HK$25 million in July 2023. Last month, Bridgeway divested a ground-level shop at 126-128 Woosung Street in Kowloon for HK$18.7 million, after paying HK$27.5 million for it three years ago.

“We will keep offloading our assets to cash out around HK$300 million,” Lee said. The fund is boosting its liquidity to invest in other assets with good potential amid the market stress, Lee added.
The capital market would definitely be impacted by the US-China trade war as investment confidence weakens, he said, reiterating his view during an interview last month."

Yu Shing, the pharmacy owner, is expected to pay about HK$1 million (US$129,000) a month for the premises at 22-24 Russell Street, according to property agents, who declined to be named because the information is private. No other tenancy terms were immediately available.
The Yu Shing leasing deal marks the latest change of tenant mix in Causeway Bay, one of Hong Kong’s four core shopping districts, as the city’s retail industry continues to grapple and evolve with economic conditions and changing spending habits among local consumers and tourists.
Tenants along Russell Street, a 250-metre-long thoroughfare, paid as much as US$2,671 per square foot on average in annual rent at the peak of the market in 2018, topping global shopping strips including the Champs Elysees boulevard in Paris, Omotesando in Tokyo and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, according to Cushman & Wakefield."

While most leading Hong Kong competitors skip the Asia Triathlon Cup in Dexing on Saturday, Hilda Choi Yan-yin has opted to compete in a bid to boost her National Games medal chances.
The 2018 Asian Games bronze medallist will join Cade Wright in a skeleton women’s city team in mainland China this weekend. A five-strong men’s quota will not feature any of top trio Oscar Coggins, Robin Elg or Jason Ng Tai-long, who are all being held back for a World Cup race in Chengdu next month.
“Racing would not be conducive to them delivering their best World Cup performance,” head coach Andrew Wright said. “They need a consistent training block, with no travel, tapering or recovery.”
After a continental sprint championships a fortnight ago in which Choi, 31, finished 24th in the individual race and struggled on her relay leg, Wright said his athlete “had a bit of a shocker”.
“She executes swims well in sessions, but not in races,” Wright said. “It’s productive to send her to every race where the swim is going to be fast.
“For her and Cade, the biggest gap to the best National Games athletes is the swim. If they close it, they’ll be in the race on the bike, then the run takes care of itself.”"

The gleaming black-and-gold dining room at Coqodaq is rowdy, and it is not even open for dinner yet. A table of “rappers and podcast hosts” are lingering over a late US$4,000 caviar-and-champagne lunch, executive chef Seung-kyu Kim says.
He does not mind – he wants his Manhattan restaurant, notorious for its caviar-topped chicken nuggets (US$28 per nugget), to be a place people visit to celebrate.
As bird flu forces stores in the United States to ration US$10-a-dozen chicken eggs, salt-cured fish eggs have become inescapable at high-end restaurants.
The slimy, briny spheres can now be found atop US$68 sour cream and onion dips in Nashville and US$73 egg salads in San Francisco.
“There’s a caviar craze and each time someone asks me why, I tell them the same thing: an influx of mass-produced Chinese caviar at super low prices,” says Edward Panchernikov, director of operations at Caviar Russe, a caviar restaurant in New York."

Jojo Wang, a sourcing agent based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, was stunned when her social media followers surged from around 100 to over 108,000 in the past two days.
The spike came after her viral video exposed extreme price disparities in the fashion industry. It revealed that the factory price of a pair of Calvin Klein jeans was only US$15, compared to a retail price of about US$100 in the United States. The video generated over 220,000 views in just 48 hours.
Wang’s videos are part of a growing trend on TikTok. Since the US-China trade war escalated earlier this month, Chinese suppliers have broken down the actual costs of branded goods, appealing to overseas consumers to bypass tariffs and retail mark-ups by ordering straight from the source.
Keng Yin Lam, a Guangzhou-based clothing wholesaler, specialises in selling unsold inventory from factories at shockingly low prices. In his TikTok posts, he reveals that branded T-shirts could cost as low as US$0.6, while jeans can go for US$1.3 – a fraction of their retail prices.
“We have huge pricing advantages,” Lam said. “Even if you triple our prices to account for tariffs, we remain fully competitive in European and American markets.”
While the claims of rock-bottom prices are still hard to verify, made-in-China products are known worldwide for their price and quality advantages."

As of the end of March, Tencent reported an over 55,000-strong workforce. Including staff from subsidiaries, the company had 110,558 employees at the end of last year, up from 105,417 the previous year, according to its annual report. Tencent’s headcount peaked in 2021 at 112,771.
With 12.22 million fresh graduates entering the job market this summer, Chinese Big Tech companies are ramping up their recruitment efforts.

Bodybuilders and weightlifters looking for gains have long leaned on creatine to help build muscle and hasten post-workout recovery.
But according to scientists in Australia, Canada and the US, dosing up on the sport supplement makes next to no difference when it comes to getting big in the gym.
In contrast to previous findings, the results of this study showed that creatine had no additive effect on lean body mass changes when combined with resistance training, the researchers said in a paper published in the journal Nutrients.
The “confounding” effect, or lack thereof, suggests that bigger and potentially unsafe doses of creatine could be needed to show it having a discrete muscle-building impact.
There are ample studies – not to mention advertising and social media influencers flaunting their sponsored brands – suggesting that creatine does exactly what it says on the tin."

Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies on Wednesday unveiled an upgraded version of its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered eyeglasses, ratcheting up competition in the already crowded market for wearable hardware.
Priced at 2,299 yuan (US$315), the new eyewear came with a sleek titanium frame and enhanced AI-powered capabilities to handle a range of tasks from gesture control and voice commands to simultaneous translation, the Shenzhen-based telecommunications and consumer electronics giant said on Wednesday.
The product, which represents a small upgrade to Huawei’s second-generation AI eyewear that debuted in 2023, comes at a time when the AI glasses sector is poised to grow exponentially, as players from Big Tech firms to start-ups take advantage of breakthroughs in generative AI – the technology underpinning OpenAI’s ChatGPT – to enhance offerings in the segment.
He Wancheng, an analyst at Wellsenn XR, a market consultancy focusing on the augmented reality and virtual reality sectors, said that the integration of AI and eyewear – with estimated combined sales of over 1.5 billion myopic glasses and sunglasses every year – would propel the new gadget category’s growth in coming years.
“Glasses are one of the best application cases for AI,” He said.
Global shipments of AI glasses will experience 130 per cent growth this year to reach 5.5 million units, compared with 2.34 million in 2024, according to Wellsenn XR.
While China accounted for only around 2 per cent, or 500,000 units, of global AI glasses shipments last year, the country’s tech firms have expressed enthusiasm over the sector’s prospects."

3/5 stars
A quartet of rookie robbers take on the elite yet corrupt members of the older generation in Smashing Frank.
This stylish but lightweight crime drama, however, is considerably more effective as a portrait of disaffected youth than as a parable on the growing chasm between young and old, and wealthy and poor, in Hong Kong.
The feature debut of writer-director Trevor Choi Hong-ying, a Hong Kong native who started his film-directing education upon returning to the city in 2018, Smashing Frank is notable for being part-financed with a crowdfunding campaign initiated by the YouTube Channel “16 by 9”, of which Choi is director.
After a cryptic opening that bleeds attitude but reveals little, we are introduced to Ayla (Hedwig Tam Sin-yin), the impoverished leader of a new gang named “Frank”; Hugo (Locker Lam Ka-hei), a loyal accomplice who may be her boyfriend; and Chun (Sham Ka-ki), a nerd they recruit while all are serving community-service sentences."

It’s an exciting time to be in Hong Kong for enthusiastic imbibers like myself. A few weeks ago, it was announced that the World’s 50 Best Bars awards will be hosted in the city for the first time, on October 8.
Having previously hosted two editions of Asia’s 50 Best Bars, in 2023 and 2024 (both at Rosewood Hong Kong), the city has been upgraded to welcome the world’s finest bartenders, following in the footsteps of London, Barcelona, Singapore and Madrid.
Not bad for a place that, post-pandemic, had struggled to convince wary tourists that we had some serious “night vibes” going on.
The image is helped by Hong Kong’s own Bar Leone in Sheung Wan being crowned Asia’s Best Bar in 2024, and runner-up in the world edition of the awards a few months later. It only seems fair to bring the party back to this side of the world.
And this year, when the world’s most discerning drinkers descend upon Hong Kong, they’ll have a new spot to flock to.
Timed perfectly for their arrival is a new project by Bar Leone’s Lorenzo Antinori, who has teamed up with Simone Caporale of Barcelona’s Sips, which was crowned World’s Best Bar in 2023 and is currently ranked third."

“I started cooking when I was very young. My mother’s eyesight wasn’t very good so I had to help my family by doing chores and would cook simple things like stir-fried vegetables and rice. Then when I was 14, I got a job working at a cha chaan teng delivering food,” says Lee. “The head chef thought I was hard-working so he took me under his wing. For six months I learned how to make char siu and duck as well as egg tarts and pineapple buns.”
With a stellar career behind him, working his way from local cha chaan teng to Mandarin Oriental, Fortune Room and Hoi Yat Heen, Lee has been executive chef of Mott 32 Group since 2014. Here, he blends traditional Chinese flavours with Western techniques, crafting the Mott 32 culinary vision, which includes frequently working on flavour development and improving the menu’s signatures, like the Iberico char siu.
“We spent a long time reviewing the original roasting and preparation methods with a key focus of finding the perfect balance of succulent pork and roasted char flavour,” says Lee.
Original inspiration came from the restaurant’s initial menu development process, where other Maximal Concepts chefs were invited to taste and review the dishes. “One chef hailed from Barcelona and upon tasting char siu made with Chinese pork suggested we try the same process with the pluma cut of Iberico pork.” So, whilst maintaining the authenticity and tradition of Chinese cooking, Lee sourced the meat from top-grade Iberian pigs. “Each cut comes from [pigs] raised on a diet of acorns, grass and herbs, giving the meat a soft and succulent quality that is further emphasised by the traditional roasting methods employed by our barbecue chefs,” Lee explains.
The meat is marinated in a secret recipe of house-made char siu sauce, to deliver the perfect balance of sweet and savoury. Once roasted until soft and tender, a light glaze of yellow mountain honey is then brushed over the pork to finish, adding a final rich touch of flavour."

Huang’s visit comes as Beijing and Washington have locked horns in a tariff war, with Nvidia being one of the US tech leaders bearing the brunt of hostilities between the two countries. Huang had dinner with US President Donald Trump a week ago.
According to posts on a social media account affiliated with the state-owned China Central Television (CCTV), Huang arrived in Beijing on Thursday at the invitation of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, a state-backed body representing Chinese exporters.
Huang, 62, met with Ren Hongbin, chairman of the council, and expressed hope that Nvidia could continue to cooperate with China given that it is a “key market” for the company, according to a report by CCTV on Thursday.
“We regularly meet with government leaders to discuss our company’s products and technology,” an Nvidia representative said on Thursday.

Investors are focusing more on TSMC’s 2025 outlook for revenue and spending, which its executives will outline later Thursday. The global tech sector is particularly nervous after a turbulent few days, when US restrictions on the export of Nvidia chips to China and a disappointing report from ASML Holding NV dimmed the outlook for semiconductors. Those two industry linchpins shed US$200 billion in market value Wednesday.
For 2025, the market remains nervous about the impact of tariffs on the global economy and a sector that supplies critical components to just about every industry on the planet.

Long mocked, white socks are now firmly back in fashion. No longer are they seen as a hallmark of Germans abroad when paired with sandals.
These days, white socks are often worn with shorts so that the brand logo can be clearly seen, whether that be Nike, Adidas or Puma.
Meanwhile, short trainer socks, previously loved by millennials – born between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s – are staying stuck at the bottom of our sock drawers, especially ones that make it look as though you are not wearing any socks at all.
“Instead of socks you can barely see, the trend now is for socks that can be seen from a mile away,” German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung says."

The embedded ADAS, dubbed “God’s Eye”, can also navigate highways and self-park. In February, BYD said the system would eventually be introduced to nearly all of its vehicles – including the Seagull hatchback, which starts at 69,800 yuan."

Technology stocks sank as new US government restrictions on the export of Nvidia chips to China and a disappointing report from ASML dimmed the outlook for the semiconductor sector, wiping out more than US$200 billion in market value for the two companies alone.
Nvidia fell 6.9 per cent after the chipmaker warned it will report around US$5.5 billion in related charges during the fiscal first quarter. Dutch chip-equipment maker ASML slid 7.1 per cent in US trading. The sell-off in semiconductor stocks over the past three months has already wiped out about US$2 trillion in market capitalisation.
President Donald Trump’s administration has barred Nvidia from selling its H20 chip in China, an escalation of Washington’s tech battle with Beijing. Advanced Micro Devices also said the export control applies to its MI308 products, and that it sees a change up to US$800 million on account. AMD fell 7.4 per cent.
ASML later added to investor anxiety by posting orders that missed expectations and saying that it does not know how to quantify the impact of recent tariff announcements.
“While ASML delivered on the revenue front, it has left investors disappointed at a time when uncertainty will punish such results,” said Ben Barringer, a technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot. Coupled with the latest export restrictions on Nvidia chips, “all of this just adds to the multitude of headaches facing tech CEOs right now, with no sign of the difficulty ending soon.”
A bigger-than-expected drop in ASML’s bookings failed to alleviate concerns over a potential slowdown in AI demand. Investor focus will now turn to results from key customer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday."

While yachting is often perceived as an activity for the privileged few, Lawrence Chow entered the world of sailing by spending about HK$16,000 (US$2,063) to buy a boat with two friends about 10 years ago.
“It is a small boat but very affordable, splitting between three people, and we can enjoy the water,” said Chow, who is now the chairman of the Hong Kong Boating Industry Association (HKBIA), which represents all sectors of the leisure marine sector and aims to make boating more accessible to the public.
Leisure-boat ownership in Hong Kong is growing faster than in other Asian markets, fuelled by younger consumers’ tendency to splurge on experiences and the recovery of travel after the Covid-19 pandemic.
The government has set out policies to support the city in attracting yacht sales and oceangoing travellers, which could make the city a centre for the industry’s further growth, according to experts.
The global leisure yacht market, valued at US$39 billion last year, was projected to reach US$43 billion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate of 5 per cent, said Arthur Tay, CEO of marina developer and operator SUTL Enterprise. At the firm’s yachting festival in Singapore last week, he said this growth indicated strong global interest in leisure boating, luxury experiences and marina tourism.
The number of licensed pleasure vessels in Hong Kong more than doubled to 12,325 in 2024 from 2007, according to the Marine Department. The total far surpasses other Asian markets, including Singapore with about 4,000 pleasure crafts, mainland China with 6,000 and Japan with 7,113, based on separate industry estimates."

TikTok’s GMV reached US$290.8 million in the last week of March.
The White House said late on Tuesday that China would face up to 245 per cent tariffs on exports as a result of Beijing’s retaliatory actions. Such a level could significantly disrupt trade between the world’s two largest economies.
TikTok Shop, along with platforms like Shein and Temu, has emerged as a major channel connecting Chinese vendors with US consumers.
Their success has been partly attributed to the de minimis exemption, which has allowed shipments valued below US$800 to enter the US duty-free. However, the US plans to end the exemption for China on May 2.

Owning a Formula One team could be the next step for Saudi Arabia after sponsoring the sport and hosting a grand prix, according to the chairman of the kingdom’s automobile and motorcycle federation.
Prince Khalid bin Sultan Al-Abdullah Al-Faisal told reporters in a video call ahead of this weekend’s race in Jeddah that the interest was there.
“It could happen, it could happen soon if you see the growth [of the sport],” he said.
“If you are going to buy a Formula One team then people will buy it to make money out of it, especially if it’s going to be bought by one of the PIF [Saudi Public Investment Fund] companies.
“We see Formula One is reaching new markets, sales are globally increasing …
“It’s not easy to say which team to buy and how you’re going to manage it. But we have a lot of interest … we’re hosting Formula One, sponsoring teams. So I wouldn’t be surprised if we see an announcement for a Saudi team.”"

A Hong Kong court has dismissed an appeal by the head of a now-dissolved pro-independence political party, ruling that minimum sentences apply to all conspiracy offences under the national security law even when the penalty is not explicitly provided.
The three presiding judges found the lower District Court correctly labelled the case as serious, warranting a jail term of at least five years for the 42-year-old under a two-tier sentencing regime.
The appellate court also weighed in on a high-profile trial of 47 opposition activists, while setting a benchmark over a contentious topic surrounding the Beijing-decreed legislation which could affect the outcome of other proceedings.
The national security law stipulates a prison sentence of five to 10 years for a serious offence of inciting secession, but provides no express mechanism for penalising a conspiracy to commit the crime.
Prosecutors levelled the charge by invoking the national security law and the colonial-era Crimes Ordinance, which outlines the principles for sentencing conspiracy offences. One requirement is that sentences should match the gravity of the substantive crime."

Hong Kong’s digital policy body has called for a ban on generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems that pose threats to human safety and extensive supervision of such software if it must be used in critical infrastructure, as part of new guidelines.
Speaking at the second day of the World Internet Conference Asia-Pacific Summit on Tuesday, Commissioner for Digital Policy Tony Wong Chi-kwong announced the city had published the new technical and application guidelines for generative AI tools.
“Its primary objective is to balance AI innovation application and responsibility, thereby constructing a governance framework tailored to the Hong Kong context, with local characteristics for all stakeholders in the AI ecosystem,” he said in a speech.
“We hope the guidelines can facilitate the industry and the public in developing and applying generative AI in a safe and responsible manner, while encouraging innovative application of AI, mitigating risk and fostering the widespread adoption of generative AI in Hong Kong.”
The office earlier commissioned the Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Centre, which falls under the government’s InnoHK innovation programme, to research the topic and propose guidelines.
The centre reviewed the technology’s application and the positions taken by various jurisdictions, in addition to gathering feedback from the innovation and technology industry to compile the guidelines covering technologies, developers, service providers and users."

Nvidia’s NVL72, launched in March last year, features a 72-graphics processing unit (GPU) NVLink domain that functions as a single, powerful GPU, enabling real-time inference for trillion-parameter large language models (LLMs) at speeds 30 times faster than previous generations.
NVLink is a high-speed interconnect technology developed by Nvidia that allows multiple GPUs to communicate with each other and share data more efficiently.
Huawei’s new supernode, currently deployed in the company’s data centres in Wuhu, a city in central Anhui province, achieved 300 petaflops of computing power, compared with the 180 petaflops offered by Nvidia’s NVL72, the report said, citing data from Huawei.

In his opening speech at the 2025 World Tourism Cities Federation Fragrant Hills Tourism Summit, Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu affirmed that Hong Kong would continue to be a “major global trading centre” and “a centre of free trade”.
“That’s thanks … to the Hong Kong port in our harbour, to the Hong Kong International Airport, and to our varied and seamless transport links to China, our country,” he told a room of 800 tourism leaders.
“These seamless links, and our singular status as the city where East has long met West, are not going to change.
“In a world beset by trade woes and geopolitical crises, Hong Kong is determined to continue its dedication to free and open trade.
“This was what also allowed Hong Kong to become ‘one of the world’s greatest centres for tourism.’”"

From cutting-edge technology to consumer goods, the impact of the escalating trade war between the world’s top economic powers can be heard and felt.

“Our distributors in the US now fall into two camps: those holding back and placing no orders, and those who have placed orders but told us not to ship,” said a sales manager from an electronics company that was seeing 40 per cent of its sales come from the US market before the current upheaval.
With a booth at the event, commonly known as the Canton Fair, she said suppliers like her company are all waiting to see how the two countries move forward with negotiations, and how tariffs will ultimately affect different product categories.
“Only then can we figure out whether there’s still a chance, or how we might split the tariff burden with our customers,” she added."

“Soft resistance” has become an important avenue for foreign political intervention amid a tense geopolitical climate, Hong Kong experts and officials have said, with authorities having been urged to not just bolster legal defences against such threats.
The panel of academics and government officials, moderated by Chief Secretary Eric Chan Kwok-ki, issued the call after the opening ceremony for this year’s National Security Education Day on Tuesday.
They also said soft resistance included disinformation and ideologies “targeting the mind”, with one expert on the panel warning that such activities would be on the rise as geopolitical tensions grew.
“They cannot accept the new political order, and will do everything they can to find ways to damage Hong Kong’s stability and governance, making it a place that continues to threaten national security,” said Lau Siu-kai, who is a consultant with Beijing’s semi-official think tank, the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies.
“‘Hard resistance’ has become difficult; hence soft resistance has become an important means of political struggle.”
He described soft resistance as surreptitious acts such as “thought infiltration”, psychological and ideological warfare, “colour revolution” and subversion – a contrast to rioting, coups and armed conflicts, which all fell under hard resistance."

The administration has not limited its efforts to the federal level. It has also taken aim at state-driven climate initiatives, seeking to override local authority and weaken environmental protections. Moves to block California’s cap-and-trade policies, halt enforcement of penalties against fossil fuel firms in New York and Vermont and shut down climate lawsuits targeting oil companies all reflect a broader strategy to consolidate fossil fuel influence across every level of government.

The US economy is set to lose billions of dollars in revenue in 2025 from a pullback in foreign tourism and boycotts of American products, adding to a growing list of headwinds keeping recession risk elevated.
Arrivals of non-citizens to the US by plane dropped almost 10 per cent in March from a year earlier, according to data published on Monday by the International Trade Administration. Goldman Sachs Inc. estimates in a worst-case scenario, the hit this year from reduced travel and boycotts could total 0.3 per cent of gross domestic product, which would amount to almost US$90 billion.
Foreign tourism has been a tailwind for the US in recent years as the cessation of pandemic-era restrictions sparked a resurgence of international travel. But many potential visitors are now rethinking their holiday plans amid increased hostility at the border, rising geopolitical frictions and global economic uncertainty.
One of them is Curtis Allen, a Canadian videographer who cancelled a coming US holiday after President Donald Trump imposed punitive tariffs on his home country and suggested it should become the 51st US state. Allen and his partner have been on multiple camping trips to Oregon over the years, but this year, they will be travelling around British Columbia instead.
“We’re not just staying home,” said Allen, 34. “We’re going to go spend the same money somewhere else.”
Allen’s hesitance does not stop there. He cancelled his Netflix subscription and is actively avoiding American imports at the grocery store."

The app’s sudden popularity was spurred by TikTok videos from Chinese manufacturers claiming to supply global luxury brands.

The London Metal Exchange (LME) has approved four warehouse facilities in Hong Kong, extending its global network to the doorstep of mainland China, the world’s largest consumer of metals.
The new facilities would be able to begin storing seven of the 14 LME-approved metals within three months, the exchange said in a statement on Tuesday.
“Hong Kong is now well-positioned to further develop as a key global metals hub servicing the region and as a gateway for access to the mainland China market, reinforcing Hong Kong’s vital role as an international financial, trade and logistics centre,” said LME CEO Matthew Chamberlain.
Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui Ching-yu said the decision would further promote the development of Hong Kong’s commodity market and strengthen its role as an international financial, shipping, and trading centre.
LME-approved warehouses in Hong Kong would offer efficient delivery channels for metals trading, attracting related businesses and boosting the city’s role in global commodities and logistics, he added.
The announcement followed LME’s January decision to add Hong Kong to its global warehouse network, aiming to meet growing demand for the physical exchange of metals between mainland China and the rest of the world."

“In the past, we didn’t fully grasp its weight,” a government-affiliated think tank expert said. “But this year, it truly feels like the world is undergoing a profound shift – like a ‘once-in-a-century transformation’ unfolding, with America under Trump tripping over its own feet.
Xi and other Chinese leaders have repeatedly invoked the concept – widely seen as reflecting Beijing’s world view of a US in terminal decline and China’s ascendance, though they seldom express this explicitly in public.
A notable exception occurred during Xi’s visit to Moscow in March 2023, when he told his “dear friend” Russian President Vladimir Putin, “Let’s drive the changes together” – a statement broadly viewed as Beijing signalling its strategic alignment with Moscow against Washington."

Hong Kong police are investigating possible animal abuse after finding two turtles that may have plunged to their deaths.
The animals’ carcasses were discovered in Sau Mau Ping and Kowloon Bay on Tuesday.
A passer-by alerted police after discovering the body of an adult red-eared slider, a popular pet in Hong Kong, on Hiu Kwong Street in Sau Mau Ping at around 6.40am.
The 15-cm (5.9-inch) turtle was found mutilated, raising suspicions that it might have fallen from a great height.
Officers at the scene covered the carcass with a bucket while waiting for members from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to arrive to collect the remains.
The case has been classified as animal cruelty, though no arrests have been made so far."

Chinese President Xi Jinping has arrived in Malaysia for a three-day visit, with the Southeast Asian nation likely to seek to sell more electronics, palm oil and halal products into China, as the United States threatens its allies in the region with tariffs into its giant market.
Xi was greeted on the tarmac by Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Tuesday evening and given a guard of honour from the Malaysian Armed Forces.
He is scheduled to have an audience with Malaysia’s King Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar on Wednesday morning, followed by a meeting with Anwar, and is expected to sign a raft of deals at a crucial time for Malaysian businesses scrambling for new markets as Washington fires out tariffs.
In a statement released by the Chinese embassy in Malaysia on his arrival, Xi said he would have in-depth discussions with Sultan Ibrahim and Anwar “on bilateral relations and international and regional issues of shared interest”.
“Both China and Malaysia are major developing countries and members of the Global South,” Xi said. “Deepening our high-level strategic cooperation is good for the common interests of both China and Malaysia, and good for peace, stability and prosperity in the region and the world.”
The Malaysia visit – part of a three-nation tour of Southeast Asia – comes as China steps into the role of a stable regional leader on trade, a position vacated by the US under President Donald Trump, whose tariffs have sowed chaos, stunned exporters and questioned the direction of long-standing alliances with America."

A leading Chinese industry association has warned the country risks becoming too dependent on raw materials from individual nations in Africa, as the continent becomes a battleground in an intensifying global tussle for resources.
China’s vast manufacturing sector is heavily reliant on African countries to supply several crucial materials, with Guinea emerging as a dominant supplier of bauxite – an aluminium ore that is essential to make everything from cars to electronics.
Ge Honglin, head of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association, said this dependence could become a strategic vulnerability during a visit to the West African nation on Saturday, as he called for greater efforts to secure the bauxite supply chain.
“Internationally, greater attention must be paid to the risks of overconcentration in certain countries, ensuring safer development and acquisition of overseas resources,” Ge said, according to an article posted on the association’s website.
China’s imports of bauxite soared to 141.6 million tonnes in 2023, with the country relying on imports for 86.1 per cent of its supplies of the ore, according to a research note published by Dongxing Securities last year.
And Guinea provided most those imports. China’s bauxite imports from the West African country skyrocketed from 11.94 million tonnes in 2016 to 99.26 million tonnes in 2023, as Chinese industrial firms invested heavily in the nation.
Indonesia’s bauxite export ban, which came into force two years ago, has made China even more reliant on Guinea’s mines."

“I love Europe … I love European people,” Vance told news and opinion website UnHerd on Monday in rare favourable comments about the European Union and Britain.
“It’s not good for Europe to be the permanent security vassal of the United States,” Vance said, echoing his previous rebukes of EU states for apparent security and economic dependence on the US.
“I don’t want the Europeans to just do whatever the Americans tell them to do. I don’t think it’s in their interest, and I don’t think it’s in our interests, either.”

From the war in Ukraine to claims over Greenland, Trump’s policies are testing relations with long-standing American allies.
Just weeks after taking up his post, Vance made headlines after launching a withering attack against Europe on culture war issues at the Munich Security Conference."

Hong Kong’s biggest property developer Sun Hung Kai Properties (SHKP) is shocking the city’s housing market by launching new flats at its megaproject in New Territories at a 11-year low in the district, suggesting the market will struggle to rebound in the near term.
The developer launched the price list for 158 of the 781 units at its Sierra Sea, Phase 1A (2) at HK$10,398 per square foot on average, according to property agents. The units represent the first batch of its 9,700-unit Sai Sha development in Shap Sze Heung, which is located between Sai Kung and Ma On Shan.
This would be Hong Kong’s single largest property project by a developer since the 15,808 homes at Kingswood Villas in Tin Shui Wai developed by Cheung Kong Property between 1991 and 1999. Cheung Kong was renamed CK Asset Holdings in August 2017.
“The pricing is extremely shocking,” said Sammy Po Siu-ming, CEO of Midland Realty’s residential division. “The average price per square foot is the lowest in about 11 years in Ma On Shan, [possibly] to capture the market focus.”
The first batch comprises three one-bedroom units, 118 two-bedrooms units and 37 three-bedrooms flats, with saleable area ranging from 301 to 574 sq ft. These units were priced between HK$9,499 and HK$11,126 per square foot. All the units were priced under HK$6 million (US$773,400) each, with the cheapest at HK$2.99 million after discounts. Sales will begin next week."

“What we are trying to keep from happening is what has happened on the African continent,” Bessent told Bloomberg in Buenos Aires on Monday.

If humans eventually colonise the moon, the early settlers might toast their success with a bottle of sake, realising the dream of Japanese brewer Asahi Shuzo.
Yamaguchi-based Asahi Shuzo, known for its Dassai sake brand, took a leap forward in February, unveiling at an event in Tokyo a bottle of high-end sake that it will attempt to brew in space.
The price for the 100ml (3.3oz) bottle of Dassai Moon is 110 million yen (US$738,000) – the going rate for an alcoholic drink produced in space given that it will be the first of its kind.
Inspired by the US-led Artemis moon exploration programme and other efforts to establish a sustainable human presence on the moon, Asahi Shuzo is serious about wanting the eventual inhabitants to be able to enjoy a low-gravity tipple.
“It’s not a case of trying it out once for the sake of publicity but rather starting with the moon and moving on to other possibilities,” Asahi Shuzo president and CEO Kazuhiro Sakurai says.
First, Asahi Shuzo will attempt to brew sake on the International Space Station where equipment will recreate the gravity of the moon’s surface. The specialised brewing equipment and ingredients could be launched into orbit as early as September."

Users can communicate with the AI doctor agents through text or audio around-the-clock, and can upload medical reports for analysis. They can also help patients make appointments for offline consultations with the doctors, according to Ant.
The agents, with expertise in a range of fields including tumours and chronic diseases, are built on Ant’s medical AI foundational model and each one is trained by the doctors’ own teams.
These “doctors’ authenticated AI agents” aim to help patients obtain “authoritative and credible” healthcare advice and medical guidance, and help them seek professional help “promptly”, an Alipay representative said in a statement.

This year’s Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon will take place over two days because it has become so popular, organisers revealed on Tuesday, and Hong Kong officials said they could follow suit if it proved a success.
The change will see the half-marathon and marathon held separately, on the Saturday and Sunday respectively, on the weekend of December 6 and 7, with a children’s race, 5km, 10km and marathon relay also planned.
Officials said the move had been driven by an increase in runners over the past three editions of the event, with the marathon up 31 per cent and half-marathon 46 per cent in that time. More than 55,000 competitors took part last year.
The Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon in February attracted more than 74,000 runners, with marathon entries capped at 18,000 and the half-marathon at 24,500. There were also a 10km race, and a 10km wheelchair category.
Kwan Kee, chairman of the Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates (HKAAA), and of the marathon’s management committee, said it was too early to say whether his organisation would follow Singapore’s lead.
“We will surely study how Singapore is doing it and we are considering many new ideas to enhance our marathon, but it is too early to say for now as we are only having the first management committee meeting [for the 2026 event] at the end of this month,” Kwan said. “Any new ideas are to be brought to the committee first so that we can discuss.”"

The regulation, which took effect on March 10, grants police the authority to issue certificates so that they could “provide services and protection” to foreign journalists, especially in conflict-prone areas, National Police spokesman Inspector General Sandi Nugroho said on April 4.
Critics argue the rule is repressive and adds more red tape to an already complicated visa process.
“This policy not only exceeds the authority of the police institution, but is a major threat to press freedom and democracy,” Indonesian Journalist Safety Committee said in a statement on April 4.
“The takeover of authority … is a form of systemic weakening of journalistic work and press independence. It also … can be used freely to justify actions to obstruct journalistic work under the pretext of illegal activities.”

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said on Tuesday the country’s military capabilities were off limits, ahead of a second round of talks with the United States on its nuclear programme.
“National security and defence and military power are among the red lines of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which cannot be discussed or negotiated under any circumstances,” Guards spokesman Ali Mohammad Naini said, quoted by state broadcaster IRIB.
Iran and the US will hold another round of talks in Muscat on Saturday, a week after top officials met in the Omani capital for the highest-level discussions since the 2015 nuclear deal collapsed.
President Donald Trump, who withdrew the US from the 2015 deal during his first term, has reinstated his “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran since returning to office in January.
In March, he sent a letter to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei calling for nuclear talks and warning of possible military action if Tehran refused.
Trump addressed reporters on Monday regarding Iran, saying “I’ll solve that problem” and “that’s almost an easy one”."

A Hong Kong court has cleared a senior police officer of molesting an inspector but convicted him over drink-driving and biting a junior colleague who tried to stop him.
The District Court on Tuesday found Superintendent Joseph Luk Chun-chung guilty of dangerous driving, saying he was clearly under the influence of alcohol when he insisted on driving home after a banquet to bid farewell to a chief inspector in Fanling on July 15, 2022.
The court also convicted the 45-year-old defendant of assault for biting an inspector’s right middle finger, after finding he was under the misguided belief that he was acting in self-defence as the latter tried to pull him out of his car.
Luk was cleared of five other counts: three of indecent assault against a probationary inspector the previous month; and two counts of assault-related offences for allegedly attacking two other officers during the July episode.
Deputy Judge Katherine Lo Kit-yee warned the disgraced officer to expect jail time for his transgressions, but agreed to extend his bail until sentencing as she saw no urgent need to incarcerate him at this point.
Luk was suspended from his role as Sha Tau Kok district commander following his arrest in August 2022 on suspicion of committing a raft of offences at two dinners with fellow officers."

Easter is coming, so cue the egg puns!
Ship Street’s Southern Italian restaurant, Trattoria Felino, takes the eggs in carbonara to the next level, elevating all the familiar flavours of the beloved pasta dish, without the pasta. The Carbonara Egg layers slow-cooked egg yolk with guanciale and a pecorino cheese foam, artfully served in a hollowed-out eggshell, balanced on a bed of corn kernels.
A staple on Hutong’s menu, the Shanghainese coddled egg has seen many iterations throughout the iconic Northern Chinese restaurant’s 22 years in Hong Kong. This version, though, is perhaps the most decadent. Part of the Skyline dinner tasting menu, the gently cooked duck eggs are halved and served runny, topped with caviar and foie gras.
Topping pizza with eggs isn’t groundbreaking, but ever since The Pizza Project opened in 2020, its Carbonara pizza has arguably become the restaurant’s most iconic dish. A classic base is topped with tomato sauce, fior de latte, pancetta and one runny quail egg per slice. A simple yet delicious interpretation of breakfast on pizza, it’s a true celebration of eggs.
Exclusive to Canto cocktail bar Kinsman – and straight out of the renowned Hong Kong-based food critic Susan Jung’s cookbook Kung Pao and Beyond – Kinsman’s salted egg yolk chicken wings are made with the golden yolk of salted duck eggs and coated in bird’s eye chillies and curry leaves. Salty, spicy and full of flavour, this lip-smacking recipe embraces salted egg yolk, one of the most simple ingredients of traditional Chinese dishes and an ever-popular snack flavour."

The bustling commercial streets around one of the world’s largest electronics markets belie a secret inside its malls that illustrates how fast tariffs have hit China’s semiconductor traders.
But heading inside, a chill can be felt – especially in the chip section – with little to no foot-traffic.
“Orders have plunged since last week,” said a chip distributor who spoke on condition of anonymity. “We’ve had almost no orders in recent days due to the price increase.”
The price of a single central processing unit (CPU) – the brain of a computer – from Intel or AMD, the most common chips on the market, has increased by 10 to 40 per cent, the distributor told the Post.
Most of the chips circulating in Huaqiangbei appear to be sourced from the US and mainly serve domestic buyers. They are immediate victims of the US-China trade war – the first to feel the supply-chain pinch from tariff hikes.
After a series of back-and-forth tariff salvoes, as it stood on Tuesday, Trump had imposed a 125 per cent duty on Chinese imports since April, on top of 20 per cent imposed earlier this year, bringing the effective cumulative rate to about 156 per cent. And with its swift retaliation, Beijing’s new levies on US goods have risen to 125 per cent, also on top of previous tariffs."

Hong Kong immigration authorities have arrested 43 people, including domestic helpers, in an eight-day crackdown on illegal employment.
The 35 suspected illegal workers and eight alleged employers were apprehended after officers raided at least 58 targeted locations, including restaurants and canteens, the Immigration Department revealed on Tuesday.
The operation, code-named “Swordfish”, was held between April 7 and 14.
“We urge employers not to arrange for or require foreign domestic helpers to be employed by any other person to perform any other duties to avoid being held criminally liable,” Senior Immigration Officer Fu Chit-ho said.
“We also call on employers to pay more attention to the behaviour of foreign domestic workers, such as observing whether they look tired when they come back from days off, or whether they wear clothes similar to work uniforms when they go out.”
The suspected illegal workers – eight men and 27 women – are aged between 20 and 60 and mostly from the Philippines and Indonesia.
Most of them were arrested while they were washing dishes, handling meals or cleaning in canteens and restaurants, the department said."

The scrapping of a HK$2,500 (US$322) government study grant could force up to 60 per cent of underprivileged Hong Kong parents to cut back on their children’s extracurricular activities and educational support, according to a survey by two concern groups.
The poll was published on Tuesday by Care for Carers and the Alliance for Children Development Rights, with both organisations urging authorities to retain the scheme to alleviate the financial stress placed on needy families.
“Scrapping the HK$2,500 grant will exacerbate the dual hardship faced by underprivileged families and children; it may seem to be a small amount, but it provides significant financial and psychological support,” said Wong Man-ling, a social worker with the alliance.
“The move will not only deprive children of learning opportunities but also intensify the vicious cycle of financial challenges and mental stress faced by those struggling parents.”
Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po announced in February’s annual budget speech that the grant would be scrapped from the 2025-26 academic year, saving the government HK$2 billion annually but affecting nearly 800,000 students that year.
Authorities said that various schemes were available to students besides the study grant, which has been distributed to parents regardless of their financial status since 2019."

Hong Kong developer Swire Properties is “very positive” about opportunities in mainland China and expects to see improvements in rental income despite dampened consumer and business sentiment amid a tariff war between China and the US, according to its CEO.
“Volatility and uncertainty are never good for business, and anything which undermines consumer confidence is not good for business,” Tim Blackburn said at a media event in Chengdu. “But there is evidence that even under the current tariff scenario, there are positive opportunities and positive consequences for our businesses.”
The company is on the hunt for retail investment opportunities in Shenzhen, the southern city bordering Hong Kong, amid the “onshoring of consumption”, he added.
Declining interest rates, the onshoring trend – Hong Kong consumers visiting mainland China for shopping – and increased demand for high-end residential properties are all tailwinds, he said, adding that foot traffic across the company’s shopping centres in mainland China increased by about 5 per cent in the past year.
The Hong Kong developer has been ramping up its capital commitment to the mainland in recent years. In March 2022, it announced a HK$100 billion (US$12.9 billion) investment plan for commercial and residential projects across Hong Kong, mainland China and Southeast Asia over the next decade, with half of that earmarked for the mainland.
As of March 7, HK$46 billion, or 92 per cent of the mainland allocation had been already deployed, according to Swire Properties’ annual report. While the current priority is to complete existing projects, Swire Properties is also looking for new opportunities in Shenzhen, Blackburn said."

Over the years, the United States has been a major market for Chinese goods, with a massive portion of Chinese exports directed there. Meanwhile, China has been among the top purchasers of American products. Excluding its energy trade with China, Russia has played a relatively minor role in global trade flows.
But Trump’s decision to repeatedly impose enormous tariffs on Chinese goods could force China’s leadership to change its economic priorities and switch focus from the US to markets with fewer restrictions. Russia happens to be one of them.
However, that doesn’t necessarily mean Russia will emerge as a major winner in the US-China trade war. Even Andrey Denisov, first deputy chair of the Federation Council Committee on Foreign Affairs, argues that economic tensions between Washington and Beijing are not beneficial to Moscow.

Trump pauses US tariffs on most nations for 90 days but raises levies on China to 125%
Russia’s problem lies in its very export structure. In 2023, energy reportedly accounted for over 75 per cent of its exports to China.

What happens when Korean precision meets French flair in the music studio?
The answer played out in Seoul, where the first-ever “Atelier K-pop” songwriting camp brought together music professionals from both countries for six days of creative collaboration.
Jointly organised by the Embassy of France in Korea and the Centre National de la Musique (CNM), the initiative brought four French composers – Poppy Fusée, Jean-Noël, Robin Peret and Ugo – to Seoul for a deep dive into K-pop’s unique production process."

Ending extra classes by 8pm would allow students to spend more time with family and promote a more balanced lifestyle, said Ho Tan Minh, chief of office at the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Education and Training, on Friday.
He pointed to the significant time many students already spent in full-day schools, which typically ran from morning until 4 or 5pm, according to English daily Viet Nam News.
The city’s heavy traffic congestion, which added to students’ commute times, also factored into the decision, Minh added.
This move is the latest in a series of efforts over the past decade to regulate Ho Chi Minh City’s booming private tutoring sector.
Previous measures included a ban on private tutoring for primary school pupils and directives requiring school principals to remind teachers of their responsibility to deliver comprehensive instruction during regular hours so that students do not need extra tuition."

A Hong Kong consumer watchdog study has found that energy efficiencies for split-type air conditioners can vary up to 27.4 per cent, prompting a call for authorities to upgrade the standards for granting energy labelling.
The Consumer Council said on Tuesday that it had tested 12 models of “two-horsepower” inverter split-type air conditioners and found that Daikin emerged as the top performer in energy efficiency, saving 27.4 per cent more energy per year.
It added that the tested Daikin model offered the lowest annual electricity bill at HK$1,184 (US$152.60), which was 37.7 per cent cheaper than the General brand model that incurred the highest at HK$1,630 per year.
A split-type air conditioner is a cooling system commonly adopted in residential buildings and consists of indoor and outdoor units, according to the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department.
The test on the estimated annual electricity cost for cooling is based on the cost of HK$1.70 per kilowatt-hour, assuming operation for 12 hours per day for 180 days a year.
“The council anticipates manufacturers to strengthen quality control and recommends the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department to review current energy label grading standards, which could motivate the industry to enhance the energy efficiency of their products and introduce more energy-saving options to help consumers achieve sustainable consumption,” the watchdog said."

Wavering sentiment in Hong Kong’s residential property market appears to have stabilised, as prices have declined far enough to persuade more buyers to follow through with their commitments, according to one of the city’s largest networks of sales agents.
Forfeitures of deposits, a proxy for homebuyers’ confidence, declined to 83 cases in the first three months of this year, a 20 per cent drop from the 104 cases in the last quarter of 2024, according to Centaline. The figure fell 47 per cent year on year, the agency said.
Confidence was bolstered by a policy last year by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to relax mortgage requirements for buyers of in-progress flats, which reduced the risk that the buyers would forego the initial deposits placed at the peak of the market, said Yeung Ming-yee, a senior associate director at Centaline.
The policy, introduced in December, was a one-off scheme to allow buyers who had bought under-construction homes during the market peak to pay in stages, thus easing their financial burden. Under the plan, banks may lend up to 80 per cent the value of the homes, while the debt-servicing ratio is adjusted to 60 per cent from 50 per cent.
The scheme covered uncompleted homes for self-occupation sold between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2023, where the buyer had paid more than the valuation for the property."

Hong Kong experienced its hottest day of the year so far on Tuesday, with the city’s forecaster reporting a temperature of 33 degrees Celsius (91.4 Fahrenheit) at its headquarters in Tsim Sha Tsui in the afternoon.
The Observatory issued the very hot weather warning at 1.45pm, with temperatures in Sheung Shui soaring to 36.3 degrees.
Yeung Kwok-chung, a senior scientific officer with the Observatory, said the last time that Hong Kong had been affected by such severe hazy weather was 15 years ago.
“Although there is a chance of an easterly wind on Wednesday, where there is a possibility that the current weather situation will slowly ease. This will depend on the strength of the wind and the conditions allowing for the dispersal of the air,” he told a radio programme.
“There is a chance that this low visibility condition will last until the middle to latter parts of this week, which is the Easter holiday.”
Yeung said the forecaster had recorded visibility levels of about 5km (3.1 miles) on Monday at its headquarters between 11am and noon, which rose to about 6km during the latter parts of Monday to Tuesday."

The early deaths of these experts – due to accidents or illness – have raised concerns about the personal safety of those in the industry and the stressful research environment they face.
Chinese computer scientist Liu Shaoshan said that while AI researchers might earn huge salaries, they were also under intense pressure.
“The industry is developing too fast and the competition is very fierce,” Liu said, adding that by the time one researcher came up with an idea and made it halfway through an experiment, someone else might have already published on the same topic.
Liu added that practitioners also faced ethical pressures.

A winner at Gowran Park in Ireland pre-import, Highland Rahy took 13 starts to break his Hong Kong duck and made it back-to-back victories at the city circuit when eclipsing the Class Four 1,650m track record on his latest appearance.
However, the Francis Lui Kin-wai-trained gelding faces a tougher test rising to Class Three in Wednesday night’s Chamomile Handicap (1,650m). He bumps into several proven performers in the grade, headlined by last-start winner Aestheticism and the consistent Embraces.
Hewitson believes Highland Rahy has to elevate on his two all-the-way victories at the course and distance of Wednesday night’s race.

“I have my reservations of what he’ll be like in Class Three but with that said, he’s clearly started to acclimatise to Hong Kong as we’ve seen in his recent two runs,” Hewitson said.
“You can’t take away from the fact that he’s just run the class record last time out. It was a solid effort and I think one thing that will benefit him is being a strong galloper down in weight.
“There’s a couple in there with chances and it’s quite an open race. The difference between Class Three and Class Four for a horse like him is they are going to have a turn of foot and enjoy the pace that he sets, so it makes his task harder.
“But the fact he’s got a lighter weight, he should be able to keep running. I think it will be a tough task, but I think he’ll acquit himself well.”
Highland Rahy drops 14 pounds to carry 118 and jumps from barrier seven.
Of his other seven rides at the midweek meeting, Hewitson fancies the Lui-trained King Miles to run a bold race from gate nine in the first section of the Class Three Violet Handicap (1,200m).
“If I had to single one out on the night that can maybe take a step forward, it would be him,” Hewitson said.
“He’s always getting bad barriers, always going back and looking quite good in the finish. I think we’ve got to start taking luck out of the equation and be more positive on him.

An illegal level of omeprazole, which is used to treat gastric ulcers, was detected in Dragon Air Force’s post-race urine sample.
“A comprehensive joint investigation conducted by Racing Security and Integrity Assurance and the stipendiary stewards, which included a detailed review of the stable close circuit television, interviews with stable staff allocated to Mr Yiu and a review of treatment and medication records, did not identify the cause of the detection of omeprazole in the post-race urine sample,” chief steward Marc van Gestel said in a statement.
Dragon Air Force was disqualified from his second placing on February 12."

North Korea holds first Pyongyang marathon since closing borders during Covid pandemic
When American Cameron Mofid stepped out of the airport in Pyongyang he became one of the first tourists to visit North Korea in more than five years – and completed his mission to visit every country in the world.
Mofid was one of about 200 foreigners who travelled to the secretive state’s capital last week for the Pyongyang International Marathon, which took place on April 6 and had not been held since 2019 because of the coronavirus pandemic.
North Korea reopened to Russian tourists in January 2024 and allowed visitors from other countries to enter the eastern city of Rason in February 2025, but later cancelled those tours without giving a reason.
This year, Koryo Tours, a Beijing-based agency listed as the marathon’s “exclusive travel partner”, got foreigners into the capital – but as athletes, not tourists.
“I’ve been to every country in the world. And I can say that’s the craziest experience I’ve had my entire life,” Mofid, who took part in the 10km event, said. “It’s hard to explain the feeling, but the adrenaline that you have going to the stadium with 50,000 people is like no other.”
The marathon was part of the country’s birthday celebrations for its founding leader, Kim Il-sung, and allowed Mofid to visit his 195th country."

A staggering 92 per cent of travel insurance plans offer fewer benefits to elderly residents and children despite charging premiums similar to those covering other age groups, Hong Kong’s consumer watchdog has said before the Easter holiday.
The Consumer Council said on Tuesday that among 27 surveyed travel insurance plans, only two offered the same benefits across all age groups for similar premiums.
Twenty-two charged similar premiums for different age groups but lowered the maximum benefit limits for medical expenses or personal accidents, or both, for seniors or children. Three charged seniors a higher fee.
Some plans went as far as halving the maximum benefit limit for those aged 75 or above and those aged 17 or below for certain coverage items, including medical expenses, accidents, baggage delay and trip cancellation.
The council noted that while these adjustments could arise from risk management considerations, the industry should be aware that consumers might not fully understand these distinctions at the time of purchase.
“The industry is recommended to regularly assess the adequacy of travel insurance coverage for seniors and children and to consider raising both the maximum enrolment age and the maximum benefit limits for these two consumer groups,” it said.
The survey, conducted between February and March this year, covered 27 single-trip individual travel insurance plans from 11 companies."

Protracted sell-offs in the dollar and Treasuries – typically seen as havens in turbulent times – have exacerbated concerns that investors are lightening up on US assets in the face of tectonic trade policy shifts and broader political uncertainty.

The atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge are widely accepted by Cambodians, apart from a dwindling group of ageing former cadres and soldiers who live mostly in the remote northwest.
The hardline Maoist group led by “Brother Number One” Pol Pot reset the calendar to “Year Zero” on April 17, 1975 and emptied cities in a bid to create a pure agrarian society free of class, politics or capital.

“We hope this structural upgrade will serve as a starting point to drive the growth of our organisation, as we work together to strive upwards and look outwards, transforming Pop Mart into a truly global enterprise,” Wang said in his memo on Monday, adding that overseas revenue now accounts for nearly 40 per cent of the total.

She knows the area well, having spent three years working as a tour guide in Kakadu, Australia’s biggest national park, famous for its rugged cliffs, lush rainforest and rock art galleries up to 20,000 years old.
These days Bichard, a native of Jersey, the largest of Britain’s Channel Islands, lives in Darwin, where she works for Tourism NT. Her duties include creating itineraries for tourists visiting the region.
Here she shares some of her favourite places in the region to eat, drink and shop, and where to get a nature fix.

Beijing’s top official overseeing Hong Kong affairs has slammed the US’ “arrogant and shameless” imposition of tariffs and stressed that local entrepreneurs have a leading role in driving the economy, warning that those who betray national interests at critical times will “meet a grim fate and bear the curse of history”.
Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, also sought to reassure Hongkongers on Tuesday that the country would stand side by side with the city to face the US “bully” and that it would be “naive” to think that bowing down to it would achieve peace.
In a strongly worded, pre-recorded keynote speech at a ceremony to mark the 10th National Security Education Day, Xia covered a range of issues including American tariffs, US sanctions against city officials and the role of local entrepreneurs, a topic in the spotlight because of the controversial planned sale by CK Hutchison Holdings of its two ports at the Panama Canal.
“Despite Hong Kong being the largest source of the US trade surplus, the United States still imposed high tariffs on it. This is extremely arrogant and shameless,” Xia said.
“This makes it clearer to the world that the US cannot tolerate Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability, and it is the biggest sinister manipulator undermining human rights, freedom, the rule of law, prosperity and stability in Hong Kong."

Only 20 per cent of respondents said they disagreed, while 19 per cent were unsure.
Duterte consistently enjoyed high public approval throughout his presidency, particularly for his anti-drug campaign. A 2017 Pulse Asia survey found that 88 per cent of Filipinos supported the crackdown, while a 2019 Social Weather Stations poll showed 82 per cent satisfaction, largely attributed to perceptions of reduced crime and drug use.
Today, however, the national mood appears to have changed. More than half of respondents to WR Numero’s latest survey agreed that Duterte should be held accountable for killings under his administration’s drug war, while 61 per cent believed the investigation and subsequent trial would help uncover the truth about the deaths during the drug war.

Singapore’s former president Halimah Yacob has said she will file a police report over a deepfake video of her making negative comments about the government, as the city state gears up for a hotly contested general election.
In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Halimah, who stepped down from her post and did not seek re-election in 2023, said the clip was completely false.
“It’s a deepfake with even my voice being used! This is scary how AI is being used to influence voters during this critical period,” she said, without sharing the video to avoid it being circulated.
With Singapore heading into an election expected to be held in early May, Halimah urged for decorum, decency and fairness for all sides of the political divide.
“Fight on the basis of the strength of your vision and the strength of your candidates and their ability to see that vision through. Don’t resort to dirty tactics like this.
“After [the general election], we still have our people and their future to think of. It’s not a one-off boxing match,” said Halimah, who was formerly from the ruling People’s Action Party and the Speaker of Parliament.
Local media outlet CNA reported last week on the rise of deepfake videos ahead of the polls. The clips cited included ones of Singapore’s first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh."

Nvidia, the dominant player in chips for artificial intelligence models, plans to produce as much as half a trillion dollars’ worth of AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years through manufacturing partnerships.
Production of Nvidia’s latest generation AI chip, known as Blackwell, has begun at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co’s new plant in Phoenix, the company said in a statement Monday. Nvidia is also building supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas with Foxconn and Wistron, and partnering with Amkor Technology and Siliconware Precision Industries for chip packaging and testing operations in Arizona.
“Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency,” Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of the Santa Clara, California-based company, said in the statement.
The US$500 billion figure refers to the combined value of all the goods Nvidia anticipates selling in to the supply chain for AI. In large part, the number reflects a commitment from the biggest cloud computing companies to build out and upgrade data centres with the latest gear.
That group, which includes Microsoft, Amazon.com and Meta Platforms, is expected to spend US$371 billion this year on AI facilities and computing resources, a jump of 44 per cent from last year, according to a report published last month by Bloomberg Intelligence.
Nvidia also said the effort would mark the first time that AI supercomputers are produced in the US, a development that President Donald Trump touted on Monday.
During an appearance at the White House, Trump said that Nvidia made the decision because of tariffs. “It’s one of the biggest announcements you’ll ever hear – because Nvidia, as you know, controls that almost the entire sector,” he said."

China and Vietnam need to work together to “fight unilateral bullying”, President Xi Jinping said in Hanoi on the first stop of his Southeast Asia tour, which aims to stabilise neighbourhood ties amid the disruptions caused by the Donald Trump administration.
During his meeting on Monday with President To Lam – who is also the Vietnamese Communist Party’s general secretary – Xi said both countries had benefited from economic globalisation, according to a readout from the Chinese foreign ministry.
The two neighbours should now join hands to safeguard global free trade and maintain the stability of supply chains, Xi added. “Isolated small boats cannot withstand stormy waves. Only by working together on the same boat can we sail steady and far.”
Also on Monday, Xi met Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, telling him that China and Vietnam should strengthen strategic cooperation and communication and “jointly oppose hegemonism, unilateralism and protectionism”.
“[The two sides] should firmly uphold the multilateral trading system and jointly promote the development of economic globalisation in a more open, inclusive, equitable and balanced direction,” Xi said.

The stubborn boundary between “art” and “craft”, itself a puzzling and arbitrary division, is often reinforced in contemporary art settings. “Art” is deemed to be conceptually sophisticated and relevant, while “craft” is the unoriginal repetition of tradition.
At the Centre for Heritage Arts and Textile (Chat) in Hong Kong, that hierarchy comes tumbling down.
At the new exhibition titled “Lining Revealed – A Journey Through Folk Wisdom and Contemporary Vision”, the distinction between art and craft fades as soon as you walk among the exquisite pieces made from straw weaving, beadwork and patchwork, paper craft, embroidery, and other traditional techniques, as every single work has strong connections to our contemporary realities.
“Folk craft and contemporary art are often considered two totally separate worlds, but in this exhibition I want to display them together to create a dialogue,” says Wang Weiwei, the curator of the show.
“From my perspective, I see folk craft and contemporary art actually representing people’s most fundamental desire for creation, for expression, for carrying knowledge and appreciating the world, and respecting our ancestors. They are not exactly the same, but they share a lot that is universal.”
To explore these themes, Wang has invited 13 artists and craftspeople from mainland China, Indonesia, Turkey, Kazakhstan, South Korea, Japan, Azerbaijan and Hong Kong, each working in different media."

The measures come in response to calls on the government to expand support at a time of growing policy uncertainty under the current US administration and rising competition from Chinese rivals, the government said in a statement.
Seoul will also ramp up a financial assistance programme for the chips industry to 20 trillion won, versus the previous 17 trillion won, according to the joint statement from various ministries including the trade ministry.
South Korea’s decision to pump more money into its key chips sector is designed to help companies cope with heavier costs as they compete globally, it said.
Asia’s fourth-largest economy is home to the world’s top memory chipmakers, Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, though they have fallen behind some rivals in areas such as chip design and contract chip manufacturing.
In 2024, South Korea’s exports of semiconductors stood at US$141.9 billion, accounting for 21 per cent of the country’s total, government data showed."

Jayson Wu, the Chinese owner of a furniture factory in Hanoi, has been working flat out ever since US President Donald Trump abruptly paused his so-called “reciprocal” tariff policy on Wednesday.
“I’d lost a lot of business when the tariffs hit, then overnight the orders came flooding back,” said Wu, who relocated his factory to Vietnam in 2019 to avoid US anti-dumping duties targeting China.
“My American clients returned with a lot of front-loading demands – they’re very scared Trump could come up with something crazy in the next 90 days.”
Many other exporters in Vietnam share Wu’s sense of whiplash, as the country’s giant export sector scrambles to adapt to Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies.
The Southeast Asian nation has found itself in Washington’s crosshairs in recent months, as it runs a large bilateral trade surplus with the United States and has also seen an influx of Chinese investment from companies looking to relocate production and transship goods to avoid US tariffs."

Just hours earlier, Tao had emailed Wang and other team members about candidates for a new faculty position at the Centre for Bioelectronics and Biosensors, which Tao had led since 2008. Everything had seemed normal.
A highly cited, award-winning academic and entrepreneur, Tao was best known for inventing a powerful technique called the scanning tunnelling microscopy break junction. The method allowed scientists to measure the behaviour of individual molecules and helped launch entirely new fields in nanoscience, according to a commemorative issue of ACS Sensors dedicated to him.

Wang described Tao as an inspiring and generous mentor who hosted graduation parties each year at his home in Fountain Hills.
“I simply couldn’t believe it,” Wang said. He and many others were told that 56-year-old Tao had had a heart condition and had slipped while exercising in the garage building after gyms were closed in the Covid-19 outbreak.

Chinese battery producer Leoch International Technology has been pressing ahead with the first instalment of its US$200 million factory in Mexico before a June launch, with the Hong Kong-listed firm just one of many coming to grips with unpredictable US tariff policies.
Executive director and chief investment officer Helen Hong Yu said the company originally chose the country because of its tariff-free status under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and its proximity to the US.
Setting up directly in the US would have also incurred higher costs, and talent recruitment would have been more difficult.
She said the Hong Kong-listed company was also planning to take its non-China business public in the US.
But US President Donald Trump’s wide-ranging tariff policies caught her, and many others, off guard.
“When [Trump] suddenly raised tariffs, everyone found it quite surreal and asked if he was really going to impose such increases?” she said."

Mohsen Mahdawi, a legal permanent resident who has held a green card since 2015, was detained at the US Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Colchester by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, his lawyers said.
The lawyers said they did not know where he was. They filed a petition in federal court seeking an order barring the government from removing him from the state or country.
“The Trump administration detained Mohsen Mahdawi in direct retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians and because of his identity as a Palestinian. His detention is an attempt to silence those who speak out against the atrocities in Gaza. It is also unconstitutional,” lawyer Luna Droubi said in an email.
The petition describes him as a committed Buddhist who believes in “non-violence and empathy as a central tenet of his religion”."

Physicists have discovered a way to make a stronger coffee using less coffee grounds when brewing it by hand.
This latter method is known as a manual pour-over, and it involves slowly pouring the hot water in a circular motion over the coffee grounds by hand. The method, invented in the early 1900s, has seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years.
Researchers writing in the journal Physics of Fluids explain that the key to maximising flavour lies in the height and flow of the water stream.
Using a swan-neck kettle, which allows for precise pouring, creates a strong, concentrated jet of water that stirs the coffee grounds.

Each spring, China’s policymakers and state media customarily toss around an idiom to bid the economy an auspicious start: kai men hong – literally, “open door red”.
It is an expression commonly used when a new restaurant or shop opens, as it conveys an enthusiastic desire for a prosperous beginning.
But in tough economic times, when prosperity takes a back seat to lethargy, by the time summer rolls around and temperatures rise, momentum has a tendency to fizzle. Some years, enthusiasm downright nosedives after a kai men hong start.
Enter what has been depressingly dubbed the “summer blue” period – juxtaposing the propitious “red” of spring – with growth trends declining in a year’s second quarter as enthusiasm evaporates under a warming sun.
Widespread market angst last summer remains burned into memory, as the economy started with robust year-on-year growth of 5.3 per cent in the first quarter but abruptly slackened in the second quarter, with growth dipping to 4.7 per cent. Third-quarter growth cooled further to 4.6 per cent.
Noticeable declines in quarterly growth following a kai men hong start also occurred in 2019, as growth slowed quarter by quarter at the onset of US President Donald Trump’s first-term trade war. Similar slowdowns in second-quarter growth were seen in 2010 and 2012.
For this year, China is set to release its first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth on Wednesday. The consensus among economists before the disclosure was that the world’s second-largest economy looked to be impressive, with an average growth estimate of 5.16 per cent, according to financial data provider Wind."

British actress Aimee Lou Wood got the Saturday Night Live treatment over the weekend – and she was not a fan.
The White Lotus Season 3 fan favourite on Sunday aired her grievances about the latest episode of the NBC comedy show after it parodied her looks in a sketch that cast key players of the Trump administration in roles on the hit HBO series. Wood, whose pearly white teeth and White Lotus character were mocked, said in a since-expired Instagram story that she found the sketch “mean and unfunny”.
In the pre-taped White Potus sketch, Saturday Night Live celebrity host Jon Hamm portrayed Robert F Kennedy Jnr in the style of Walton Goggins’ unhinged hotel guest Rick and SNL cast member Sarah Sherman appeared as Wood’s character Chelsea – not as anyone in Trump’s inner circle. The sketch pans to Sherman’s take on Chelsea (and Wood) after Hamm’s RFK Jnr speaks about removing fluoride from drinking water.
“Fluoride, what is that?” says Sherman, wearing a wig and large fake teeth. Sherman also mimics Wood’s voice and facial expressions on White Lotus, widening her eyes and pursing her lips behind those very prominent front teeth.
After voicing her dismay, Wood said in later Instagram stories “I’ve had apologies from SNL” and further explained why she took issue with the sketch. A representative for SNL did not immediately respond to The Times newspaper’s request for comment on Monday."

The ban takes effect on May 1 and grants exclusive authority to a new state body, the Ghana Gold Board (GoldBod), to regulate and control artisanal and small-scale gold mining in a country where illegal mining has become a major issue.
“All foreigners are hereby notified to exit the local gold trading market not later than April 30, 2025,” said GoldBod spokesman Prince Kwame Minkah in a statement.
Foreigners may however “apply to the GoldBod to buy or offtake gold directly from the GoldBod”, he said.
Many Chinese nationals have been active in Ghana’s informal mining and trading ecosystem, and along with Ghanaian nationals have been repeatedly accused of illegal activities including unauthorised gold exports and environmental degradation.
Ghana, the largest gold producer in Africa, derives more than a third of its gold output from small-scale miners. Industry experts believe the move could transform the country’s multibillion-dollar artisanal and small-scale (ASM) mining sector."

“They decided that competition is too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them,” FTC lawyer Daniel Matheson said in opening remarks at the trial.

The amendment, which required a two-thirds vote, passed along party lines with 140 votes for and 21 against. It was proposed by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition led by populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Ahead of the vote – the final step for the amendment – opposition politicians and other protesters attempted to blockade the entrance to a parliament parking garage. Police physically removed demonstrators, who had used zip ties to bind themselves together.
The amendment declares that children’s rights to moral, physical and spiritual development supersede any right other than the right to life, including that to peacefully assemble. Hungary’s contentious “child protection” legislation prohibits the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality to those aged under 18.
The amendment codifies a law fast-tracked through parliament in March that bans public events held by LGBTQ communities, including the popular pride event in Budapest that draws thousands annually.
That law also allows authorities to use facial recognition tools to identify people who attend prohibited events – such as Budapest Pride – and can come with fines of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints (US$550)."

While US President Donald Trump has announced a 90-day pause on his proposed tariff hikes, exporters are still dealing with the uncertainty of a 10 per cent universal levy returning if trade deals aren’t struck as his administration envisages.
Meantime, the list of companies from Europe to Asia halting shipments of everything from cars to toys is growing, meaning consumers in the US might find there aren’t even the goods to pay for as products pile up in ports.
Here’s a look at what could go missing from American shelves as businesses weigh the cost of additional tariffs and mull reducing their US exposure.
The 90-day pause has given some respite to Indian exporters of gems and jewellery to the US, but they’re still expected to see a short-term slowdown in the next one-and-a-half months after traders front-loaded shipments to the US to try to beat the levies.
A 10 per cent universal tariff, down from the 26 per cent that was originally announced for India, would still impact gems such as loose diamonds, which operate on a slim 3 per cent-5 per cent margins, the Financial Express reported, citing Kirit Bhansali, chairman of the Gold and Jewellery Export Promotion Council.
Textile producers in Bangladesh are reporting that their US buyers have halted orders due to the tariffs, which for the South Asian nation were set at 37 per cent. Textiles and garments make up 80 per cent of the country’s exports."

Hong Kong lawmakers have urged officials to use a projected HK$1.5 billion (US$193 million) in extra tax revenue from legalising basketball betting to develop local sports, as they gave an initial nod to a government plan to allow gambling on overseas games.
Home affairs minister Alice Mak Mei-kuen on Monday reiterated that the move was not to encourage gambling but rather to regulate basketball betting as a way to claw back up to HK$90 billion in turnover estimated to have been lost to illegal gambling operators.
Mak told a Legislative Council panel meeting that her team was aware of the rising popularity of illegal basketball betting in recent years.
“To combat such illegal activities in an effective manner, we are exploring regulating basketball betting activities,” she said.
“The proposed regulatory regime for basketball betting will be modelled on the existing one for football betting.”
The government is seeking to amend the Betting Duty Ordinance to issue a licence to the Hong Kong Jockey Club, the city’s sole betting operator, to manage basketball gambling."

Craig Williams was one of several people who had been investigated for cashing in on insider knowledge on the date then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak would call the election.
Other members of the Conservative Party that controlled government at the time and a police officer were among those facing charges that carry a potential two-year prison term, if convicted.
It’s legal for politicians to wager on elections, but the investigation was about whether they used inside information to gain an unfair advantage. One of the popular bets at the time was to wager on the date the prime minister would call an election.
At the time, the conventional wisdom was that Sunak would call an election in the autumn, but he surprised people in May when he set the election date for July 4th.
The announcement was a disaster as Sunak was drenched in pouring rain outside his residence and word quickly spread that a handful of people with connections to the party had placed suspiciously timed bets."

US investment firm BlackRock, which is leading a consortium seeking to buy 43 ports from Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison Holdings, aims to take control of its two strategic Panama Canal facilities, while Italy’s wealthy Aponte family will have a majority stake in the others, the Post has learned.
A source close to the transaction said on Monday that the consortium of BlackRock, its subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and the Aponte family’s Terminal Investment Limited (TiL) was buying the portfolio for US$23 billion, but the US firm aimed to take a 51 per cent stake in Hutchison’s interest in the two Panama ports.
Geneva-based TiL would have a majority interest in the other 41 ports, which CK Hutchison does not wholly own either. CK Hutchison effectively has an 80 per cent interest in the 43 ports.
Hong Kong-based Hutchison expects to receive US$19 billion in cash upon completion of the deal. Beijing has expressed unhappiness over the sale of the two Panama Canal ports, suggesting it will hurt the national interest.
Analysts said dividing ownership of the ports would not change Beijing’s opposition to the deal because CK Hutchison should not sell the strategic assets to Western countries vulnerable to pressure from the United States.
The Panama ports are an additional source of friction between Washington and Beijing, with US President Donald Trump vowing several times to take back control of the canal from what he claimed was China’s influence. Beijing has ramped up pressure on Hutchison about selling the assets to a US entity."

Air pollution indexes in more than 10 areas in Hong Kong reached the highest health risk levels on Monday evening, as a dusty northerly airstream brought pollutants to the city for a second day in a row.
The government’s air quality health index (AQHI) had already reached “very high” levels in the morning, climbing to “serious” by late afternoon.
As of 6pm, 14 out of 18 general and roadside stations had reached “serious” levels, including in Central, Causeway Bay, Mong Kok, Tuen Mun, Tai Po and North district.
The remaining stations registered “very high” levels. Conditions remained largely unchanged two hours later.
Meteorological experts said that due to the combined effect of a low-pressure system in mainland China and cold air, strong winds blew dust and other pollutants southward, resulting in serious air pollution in Hong Kong for consecutive days.
As the northeastern monsoon carried particulate pollutants from the mainland, PM10 concentrations across multiple areas in Hong Kong began to surge from Saturday night."

Four new robots will be deployed to severely flooded areas in Hong Kong to help cope with inclement weather.
The Drainage Services Department said on Monday that it had invested about HK$3 million (US$386,844) to buy the four pumping robots with an aim to expedite its work in managing severe flooding incidents.
Director of Drainage Services Ringo Mok Wing-cheong said that the most expensive robot acquired this year cost around HK$1 million, given its ability to operate for eight consecutive hours and pump 800 cubic metres of water per hour.
Taking into account the other three robots, which have pumping capacities of 500 or 700 cubic metres per hour, the combined drainage capacity of all four machines is 2,500 cubic metres, equivalent to the volume of an Olympic-sized swimming pool.
“Given the huge impact of extreme weather on Hong Kong, there is a need to acquire strong pumping robots,” he said.
“When the water level reaches a certain level … we will take action and consider whether to deploy the robots.”"

Lawmakers in Bali are sounding the alarm over a growing trend of sham marriages between foreign nationals and locals – a tactic increasingly used to circumvent Indonesia’s restrictions on land ownership and immigration.
The issue was raised again during the 12th plenary session of Bali’s regional legislature last week, when I Gusti Ayu Mas Sumatri, speaking on behalf of the Democrat-Nasdem faction, highlighted viral social media posts alleging that foreigners were exploiting legal loopholes to acquire land and property.
“Some foreign tourists commit fraudulent practices by doing contract marriages with local people for the purpose of being able to buy or control property in Bali,” Sumatri said as quoted by local news outlet Tribun Bali.
Sumatri said the properties in question often included land, hotels and villas located in tourist hotspots, particularly in Badung Regency.
“Please coordinate with the relevant agencies, governor, to strengthen oversight of foreigners in Bali – especially by immigration and the police,” she added.
Her remarks come amid growing concern that sacred cultural institutions such as marriage are being hollowed out for material gain. “What should be sacred is now being exploited,” Tribun Bali wrote in an editorial about the issue, noting that many Balinese were aware of the practice but felt powerless to intervene."

This was the latest development, not long after US Customs and Border Protection uploaded a bulletin past 10pm on Friday night, notifying anyone who might have been refreshing the agency’s site at that hour that those products would be exempt from Trump “Liberation Day” tariffs.
Each of these twists and turns has been chalked up to the supposedly ruthless attempts by America’s friends and foes alike, during many US administrations, to exploit the country.
However, what Trump leaves out is that these decades of alleged scheming by America’s trade partners have clearly failed, considering how much others have envied the US’ economy and technological innovation. The United States’ economic dominance has been in place for so many decades that many people alive today have only known such a reality. Washington has dictated the rules for just as long, enforcing them with the power of its currency."

Under restrictions adopted by the Dutch government under pressure from Washington, ASML is not permitted to sell its most advanced equipment to Chinese buyers. But for almost two years, massive purchases of its lower-end products have pushed Dutch shipments to China through the roof, bucking a broader trend of falling Chinese demand for European goods.
In March, however, exports fell by 10.4 per cent compared to a year earlier in value terms, according to statistics released by China’s customs agency on Monday. As recently as December, January and February, the trade was growing strongly, with Dutch exports to the world’s second largest economy soaring 11 per cent over the course of 2024.
The drop, however, was not fully unexpected. In a video interview in January for the release of the Dutch tech giant’s year-end financial results, CEO Christophe Fouquet said the company would soon have cleared its backlog of orders from China.
“We had a lot of discussion about China in 2023-2024 because our revenue in China was extremely high. We have explained that this was caused by the fact that we are still working on some backlog created in 2022, when our capacity was not big enough to fulfil the whole market,” Fouquet said.
“2025 will be a year where we see China going back to a more normal ratio in our business. So I think we’re going to see again numbers people used to see before 2023,” he added."

A Hong Kong government lawyer has urged a court to dismiss an activist’s judicial challenge against a prison rule barring women inmates from wearing shorts in summer, saying individual preferences should not override the need to maintain a “humane and decent” custodial environment.
The High Court on Monday heard oral arguments arising from Chow Hang-tung’s application for a judicial review of the Correctional Services Department policy, which requires women inmates to wear trousers in the daytime all year round unless they have medical or religious reasons.
The 40-year-old barrister turned activist is on remand in the Tai Lam Centre for Women awaiting a national security trial over her role as a former vice-chairwoman of the now-dissolved Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, the group that had organised the city’s annual Tiananmen Square vigil.
The court heard women inmates had been required to wear dresses throughout the year until 2003, when they were allowed to put on trousers in winter.
Trousers became the standard garment in 2011. Women inmates can only wear shorts at night and during physical training sessions.
Chow’s lawyers argued that the “plainly arbitrary” rule amounted to sexual discrimination and violated the right to equality, as women prisoners were treated less favourably than their male counterparts who could wear shorts in summer."

Ho was taken into custody following a search of his home on Thursday, according to the Taipei District Prosecutors Office on Saturday. Ho is suspected of violating Taiwan’s National Security Act, and prosecutors expressed concern that he might collude with others or destroy evidence if released.
“To prevent collusion or tampering with evidence, the district court has ruled that the suspect be detained and held incommunicado,” the office said.

Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said on Monday that the reform announced last month would also optimise a fee waiver mechanism to provide greater protection for low-income residents.

He urged the government to explain the terms of eligibility more simply to residents, such as by making comparisons with the criteria for existing living allowances.

The Nio collaboration, which comes after Alibaba expanded its strategic partnership with the BMW Group on LLM adoption, and is reportedly in talks with Tesla for potential cooperation, reflects the progress the tech giant has made in commercialising AI technologies in the car industry.

China is scrambling to roll out more measures to boost consumer spending as it strives to offset the worst effects of an escalating trade war with the United States that threatens to rock its export sector.
The southern island of Hainan is holding a major consumption expo in an effort to attract high-spending foreign shoppers on Sunday, while local authorities across the country launch additional measures to encourage domestic consumers to open their wallets.
The China International Consumer Products Expo, the largest premium consumer goods exhibition in the Asia-Pacific region, opened on Sunday at a time when domestic consumption is becoming ever more crucial amid the intensifying global tariff war.
The six-day event, billed as China’s only national-level expo dedicated to consumer products, also came as local governments offered more stimulus for consumer spending as a main strategy to shore up the slowing economy.
Chinese policymakers need to take further action to “strengthen people’s confidence and willingness to spend”, the state-owned media outlet Economic Daily said in a commentary on Monday.
“When that confidence translates into bustling shopping scenes and pro-consumption policies are felt at the grass roots, China’s economy will gain greater resilience and vitality,” it said.
Over 4,100 brands from more than 70 countries and regions are taking part in the expo, representing a range of premium and emerging consumer sectors including fashion, digital, health and green consumption, state-run news agency Xinhua reported."

Secretary for Security Chris Tang Ping-keung informed lawmakers at a Legislative Council security panel meeting on Monday that the total number of such visas granted to applicants from Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar had also increased from 50 in the five years before the relaxation of criteria to 110, from the time the criteria was eased from last October until this February.
The Hong Kong government eased the application criteria for multiple-entry visas for visitors from some of the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in 2023 and 2024.
This allows individuals with a history of trouble-free travel to various countries to encourage them to visit the city.
Previously, the criteria for such visas depended on the applicant’s frequency of visits to Hong Kong and their adherence to the law during their stays. Generally, applicants were required to have made three or more visits to Hong Kong in the past 12 months
Authorities also extended the validity period for these multiple-entry visas for Asean countries from two to three years, with each permitted stay remaining at a maximum of 14 days.

“He trialled well and it’s just to keep his condition. He’s fit and happy,” Lui said.
“I think it’s a tough race. He won the Derby but we don’t know his quality yet and what grade.”
A maiden from 13 Australian starts and three in Hong Kong before the Derby, Cap Ferrat bagged an upset victory at $26.7 when he narrowly beat My Wish in the city’s most prestigious race.

Japan’s population fell to 120.3 million as of October 2024, official data showed on Monday, marking a record fall of 898,000 people from the previous year.
Japan’s birth rate is among the lowest in the world, a trend which has meant having a shrinking workforce, fewer consumers and businesses fighting to recruit workers.
It was the largest fall on record since the government began collecting comparable data in 1950, according to the internal affairs ministry.
The government has been trying to offer help to young families who wish to have children but feel they cannot, because of economic reasons, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi.
“We understand that the declining birth rate is continuing because many people who wish to raise children are not able to fulfil their wishes,” he said during a regular media briefing on Monday.
Japan’s population including foreign nationals also fell by 550,000 people to 123.8 million – the 14th straight annual fall, as the country has failed to effectively address its chronic population decline."

It ranks among the most important nutrients you have likely never heard of: choline. Drop the ‘h’ to pronounce it. Having enough of it could help to lower your dementia risk by 23 per cent, according to a study published in January.
An essential nutrient that is neither vitamin nor mineral, choline plays a critical role in cognition, and may help prevent dementia and mild cognitive impairment.
An earlier study concluded that a low level of choline in a diet was associated with increased risks of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease – so there seems to be a clear link.
Choline helps to maintain healthy cell membranes, producing a fatty molecule that helps to support their structural integrity and fluidity so they function optimally, says clinical nutritionist Katia Demekhina, from Omni Vitality in Hong Kong.
Sometimes called the “memory molecule”, choline is needed to produce the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. First identified 100 years ago, acetylcholine is one of the most abundant neurotransmitters in the nervous system."

“Tibet-related affairs are purely China’s internal matters,” foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said on Monday as he announced Beijing’s decision on the reciprocal visa restrictions.
“The United States’ imposition of unwarranted visa restrictions on Chinese officials under the pretext of Tibet-related issues seriously violates international law and the basic norms governing international relations,” Lin said.
“Tibet is open, and China welcomes friendly foreign individuals to visit, travel, and conduct business in Tibet. At the same time, China opposes any country or individual interfering in Tibet-related affairs under the guise of so-called human rights, religion, or culture.”
Beijing also opposes “individuals with ulterior motives using the pretext of visiting Tibet to carry out disruptive or damaging activities”, Lin added.
In a statement issued on March 31, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington would impose additional visa restrictions on Chinese officials “determined to be substantially involved in the formulation or execution of policies related to access for foreigners” to Tibetan areas."

Hong Kong is in the “unfortunate” position of being caught in the crossfire of US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, the American Chamber of Commerce in the city has said.
The influential business group said on Monday it supported the Hong Kong government’s stance that the city was a separate customs entity distinct from mainland China, its first comments since the announcement of the “reciprocal” tariffs rattled global markets.
The position contrasts with Trump’s previous move to end the city’s preferential trading status and instead treat it the same as the mainland. Tariffs slapped on Chinese goods also apply to those from the city.
AmCham said Hong Kong found itself wedged between two economic superpowers.
“The recent US trade policy decisions and worldwide reactions have had great ramifications on the global economy,” the 2,000-member chamber said.
“Hong Kong, a long-time supporter of free economy and trade, is caught in the middle.”"

Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has sought to tamp down growing public unease over his administration’s direction, insisting in a rare media interview that recent defence reforms are misunderstood – but civil society groups say his comments have done little to allay fears of democratic backsliding.
In a round-table session held at his private residence in Hambalang, Bogor, on April 6, the president fielded questions from senior editors at seven of Indonesia’s top news outlets. First Deputy Communications and Digital Minister Angga Raka said the interview’s questions were unscripted and that the president took part without any prior briefing.
Just over 150 days into his presidency, Prabowo has faced two waves of nationwide protests – one over his economic policies and another over a controversial revision to military law.
In March, the Indonesian parliament – controlled by Prabowo’s ruling coalition – passed changes to the military law that expand the armed forces’ role in civilian institutions. The move was widely seen as a show of Prabowo’s political dominance, with critics warning it signalled an effort to restore military influence over civilian affairs and undo reforms that once drew a clear line between defence and governance.
Demonstrators took to the streets in cities from Jakarta to Aceh and South Kalimantan, voicing fears of democratic regression. Many warned that the revision could mark a return to dwifungsi, or dual function – a doctrine from former strongman Suharto’s 32-year “New Order” regime that allowed the military to control both national security and civilian administration."

Asia’s fastest man may have run the final 100 metres sprint of his career after withdrawing from the National Athletics Grand Prix last week.
Su Bingtian, who set the continental record at the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2021 with a best-ever 9.83 seconds run, failed even to reach the National Games qualification target.
The Chinese runner’s heat time of 10.49 at the Grand Prix in Guangdong on Friday was some way off the 10.11 benchmark required for the National Games and saw him pull out before the semi-final to focus on Sunday’s men’s relay.
Su, 35, said the Grand Prix – only his second 100m race since the World Championships in Oregon in July 2022 – was “a test for myself to check my competitiveness”.
“The time for this race, or any other 100m sprint in May, June or July won’t differ much,” he said following last week’s heat. “So, [I thought before the race] if the result is good, there will be another one, but if the situation isn’t ideal, it might be my last one.
“If I can’t continue to bring an advantage to my team, I don’t think there is any need to run on. I’d said I would run until I couldn’t run any more, and I did it."

Hong Kong welcomed 12.2 million visitors in the first quarter of the year, a 9 per cent increase over the same period in 2024, due largely to a spate of mega-events in March, the Tourism Board said on Monday.
Last month alone, the number of arrivals jumped 12 per cent year on year to 3.82 million amid the city’s first “Super March” campaign, which included events such as the pop culture showcase ComplexCon, the Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament, art fairs Art Basel and Art Central, and the LIV Golf Hong Kong competition.
Of the 12.2 million arrivals in the first quarter, 9.25 million or 75.8 per cent visited from mainland China, a 6 per cent year-on-year rise. The number from non-mainland short- and long-haul places of origin increased by 18 per cent.
The board on Monday reported encouraging growth in visitor numbers from non-mainland markets, with short-haul ones such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan each growing significantly year on year by 30 per cent or more.
In long-haul markets, double-digit year-on-year growth was recorded for both the United States and Canada, while Australia registered the highest increase at 32 per cent, the board added.
“Following the ‘Hong Kong Super March’ promotion … the Hong Kong Tourism Board is launching a new ‘Hong Kong Cultural Beat’ thematic promotion, shining a spotlight on traditional festivals and other events around Hong Kong from now until June,” it said.
As part of the promotion, the city will stage a drone show on the evening of May 1 at the Wan Chai temporary promenade, celebrating the Tin Hau Festival, the Tam Kung Festival and the Cheung Chau Jiao Festival."

A senior Hamas official said on Monday that the Palestinian group was prepared to release all Israeli hostages in exchange for a “serious prisoner swap” and guarantees that Israel will end the war in Gaza.
Hamas is engaged in negotiations in Cairo with mediators from Egypt and Qatar – two nations working alongside the United States to broker a ceasefire in the besieged territory.
“We are ready to release all Israeli captives in exchange for a serious prisoner swap deal, an end to the war, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and the entry of humanitarian aid,” senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu said.
However, he accused Israel of obstructing progress towards a ceasefire.
“The issue is not the number of captives,” Nunu said, “but rather that the occupation is reneging on its commitments, blocking the implementation of the ceasefire agreement and continuing the war”.
“Hamas has therefore stressed the need for guarantees to compel the occupation [Israel] to uphold the agreement,” he added."

When Le Ngoc Tham became sales manager for a new industrial estate in northern Vietnam, the goal was to turn it into an easy alternative for manufacturers leaving China to avoid the tariffs of the first US-Sino trade war.
Three years later, with less than half of the 1,716-acre project completed, dozens of companies interested in leasing the land are having second thoughts. The source of hesitation is President Trump’s latest tariffs, which, as announced earlier this month, included a 46 per cent tax on imports from Vietnam, the country’s eighth-largest trading partner.
But even though Trump announced a 90-day temporary stay on the new duties on Wednesday, and the administration said late on Friday that it would exclude certain electronics from “reciprocal” tariffs, Vietnam wasn’t exactly in the clear.
A 46 per cent tariff rate, which is higher than most other nations, would make Vietnam-made products noncompetitive in the US, its largest export market. Both buyers and producers of those goods would likely turn to countries facing lower rates, dragging down industrial activity and foreign investment in Vietnamese manufacturing.
“In the short term, that will be a hit to manufacturers,” said Le, who works for the Amata Corp., an industrial real estate company based in Thailand. “So the question they ask us is: What are we going to do next?” While the owners of factories that have broken ground here have little recourse, about 40 companies that have inquired about building facilities are hitting pause – one-fifth of which were in the final stages of investment, she said.
Vietnam benefited substantially after Trump imposed tariffs on China in 2018, as companies producing goods for the US there turned to Vietnam. In Quang Ninh province and the neighbouring port city of Haiphong, the arrival of hi-tech manufacturing, including Apple suppliers Pegatron and Foxconn, contributed to the country’s rapid industrial development and strong economic growth. In 2019, Vietnamese exports to the US surged 35 per cent compared to the previous year."

A decoupling between the world’s two largest capital markets could cost US$2.5 trillion in an extreme scenario, as investors from the US and China are forced to divest their holdings of equities and debt instruments, according to an analysis by Goldman Sachs.
US investors could be forced to sell nearly US$800 billion of Chinese stocks trading on American exchanges in case of a decoupling, the US investment bank’s analysts led by Kinger Lau and Timothy Moe said in a report on Monday. On the flip side, China could liquidate its US Treasury and equity holdings amounting to US$1.3 trillion and US$370 billion, respectively.
The sell-off was based on the assumption that US investors would be restricted by US regulations from such investments, they said.
“In the capital markets, equity investors are very focused on the renewed risk of Chinese ADR [American depositary receipt] delisting,” Goldman analysts said in the report.
Should the threat become a reality, it will affect nearly 300 companies, including some of China’s biggest technology companies. As of March 7, 286 mainland Chinese companies were listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the NYSE American and the Nasdaq, with a combined market capitalisation of US$1.1 trillion, according to the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission."

Rolex is a staunch supporter of such projects, having launched the Perpetual Planet Initiative in 2019 to champion groundbreaking discoveries and technologies that are making a positive impact across the globe.
The Swiss watchmaker recognises the importance of not only making science more accessible, but also inspiring young people to take an interest in the subject. To that end, Rolex has been working with the European Organization for Nuclear Research, also known as CERN – based in Meyrin, a suburb of Geneva, Switzerland – on its educational mission to nurture the next generation of scientists.
Investing in the future of science
Researchers working at CERN, the world’s leading particle physics laboratory that was established by European governments in 1954, have achieved many significant scientific breakthroughs over the years.
One of the most notable discoveries, in 2012, is the Higgs boson particle, also called the “God particle”, regarded as one of the biggest recent breakthroughs in the field of physics as it has deepened our understanding of how matter is formed. Other milestones achieved at CERN include British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee’s invention of the internet in 1989, and the pioneering development of touch-screen technology in the 1970s.
Rolex and CERN have long shared a passion for exploration and discovery. Their partnership dates back to 1956, when Rolex asked CERN scientists to help test a new watch designed to withstand strong magnetic forces like those used in a particle accelerator."

Ricci, a London-based dentist, is becoming increasingly worried about the escalating trade war between China and the United States – a conflict he fears will exacerbate the United Kingdom’s cost of living crisis.
“I understand why the US wants to reduce its dependence on China,” he said. “But the reality is that China produces a huge amount of things we all use. So when tariffs are added, it’s not just China that’s affected, as the supply chain disruptions may lead to price increases for everyone, including people here in the UK.”
The UK is directly impacted by several new US duties, including a 10 per cent “baseline” tariff as well as 25 per cent levies targeting the steel and automotive industries.

Hong Kong restaurants expect a 20 per cent drop in business during the coming Easter holiday, an industry leader has said, while the government estimates 6 million people will enter and exit the city during the five-day period, a 34 per cent increase over last year.
Simon Wong Ka-wo, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said on Monday that the weaker business forecast had already factored in a 10 to 15 per cent increase in transactions as more mainland Chinese visitors were expected in the city.
“Although there is no Easter holiday across the border, we do enjoy benefits from the new multiple-entry visa policy for Shenzhen residents to visit Hong Kong,” Wong told the Post. “Last year, the outflow of Hong Kong residents to the Greater Bay Area was extraordinarily high.
“The drop [from normal business days] is due to the huge number of Hong Kong residents travelling, while visitors are spending less per person.”
He added that those from the mainland were not spending as much as they used to.
Earlier in the day, Wong told a radio programme that restaurants recorded a 20 per cent drop in business over the three-day weekend that started with the Ching Ming Festival earlier this month, worse than the expected 15 per cent.
Wong said rents for restaurants had fallen by about 10 per cent generally, which allowed some businesses to reduce costs and cut prices for dishes."

A looming trade war on top of conflict in Gaza and Ukraine that has laid bare the limitations of multilateral institutions could usher in a worldwide reset, with blocs such as the Global South poised for bigger roles.
The first signs of this emerging trend were seen over the weekend in Turkey at the Antalya Diplomacy Forum, where world leaders called for greater democratisation of bodies such as the UN and its organs including the Security Council.
Analysts echo the theme stemming from the three-day platform, arguing such a push would have to be made through blocs such as the Brics grouping, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) or even the European Union, where reforms would allow voices from more economies besides those of major powers.
The veto powers of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council – the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France – needed to be expanded to the Global South or alternatively the powers of the UN General Assembly should be strengthened, they said.
Institutions such as the World Trade Organization – the only global body dealing with rules of trade between countries – had failed to effectively deal with recent challenges such as the tariff war launched by American President Donald Trump, they warned.
Neither had the UN charter been successful in its pledge to remove the scourge of war, according to experts, who noted the institution was now 80 years old and needed to vastly improve despite its track record in humanitarian aid through agencies such as the Food and Agriculture Organization and Unicef."

With a Chinese mother, American father and a solid start to life in Major League Soccer under his belt, Beau Leroux could be forgiven for thinking about where his international loyalties might lie.
But while the San Jose Earthquakes midfielder said representing China had crossed his mind, his focus was firmly on earning a spot in the United States squad ahead of a home World Cup next year.
It is a tournament his mother’s home nation are struggling to qualify for, and despite naturalising Brazil-born midfielder Serginho in an attempt to boost their hopes, China are bottom of Group C with two matches to go.
Floundering in their quest to end a 24-year wait to reach a World Cup, the Chinese team flopped at last year’s AFC Asian Cup finals too, when they failed to score in three group matches.
Still, there has been no contact between Leroux and football bosses on the mainland.
“Playing for China has been a thought of mine, but, right now, I’m trying to make the US roster,” Leroux said. “The World Cup is always in my mind, but I’ll see what the future holds for me.”"

Hutchmed (China) is evaluating supply-chain options for a blood-cancer drug recently approved by Beijing to mitigate impact from the ongoing US-China trade war, according to its chief.
Last month the company won conditional nationwide approval from China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) to sell tazemetostat, after it completed a phase two bridging study involving 42 patients.
The approval is for follicular-lymphoma patients whose cancer has a mutation called EZH2 and who either failed to respond to treatment or whose cancer has recurred after therapy. The mutation exists in 20 to 25 per cent of Chinese patients with the cancer, Hutchmed CEO and chief scientific officer Su Weiguo said. In 2022, new follicular lymphoma cases totalled 78,000 in the US and 81,000 in China, according to Hutchmed.
Tazemetostat is the first EZH2 inhibitor approved by the NMPA, Su said. Hutchmed aims to conduct separate trials in China to potentially expand the drug’s usage to patients with solid cancers.
“In recent years, drugs to inhibit EZH2 have been studied globally for treating multiple solid tumours such as triple-negative breast, ovarian and prostate cancers,” he said. “We plan to kick off similar studies on tazemetostat among Chinese patients with solid tumours.”
Tazemetostat is currently manufactured in the US and is likely to be subject to tariffs when imported into China, so Hutchmed is evaluating options to minimise the cost impact."

Chinese food and on-demand delivery giant Meituan is joining a group of Chinese internet giants in launching initiatives to help the country’s tariff-hit export businesses pivot to domestic markets amid escalating trade tensions between China and the US.
Beijing-based Meituan said on Saturday that it would actively heed the central government’s call to bolster domestic demand and consumption, by helping export-oriented businesses set up shop on its platform, according to a statement published on its official WeChat public account.
Beijing and Washington locked horns in a tariff war after the Trump administration slapped tariffs on Chinese goods, as well as those from other countries, in early April, triggering a series of retaliatory measures from Beijing. Both sides have since imposed higher tariffs on imports, taking a toll on China’s export-oriented businesses.
Meituan said it had introduced a series of measures to provide support in marketing, operations, delivery and fee exemptions to build an “integrated domestic and foreign trade” ecosystem so that export products will “benefit more local consumers”.
The move comes as Chinese online retail giants including JD.com and Alibaba Group Holding’s Freshippo are rolling out similar initiatives to help tariff-hit businesses expand in local markets. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post."

The design of sensors that exploit the strange features of quantum mechanics is a vibrant frontier of modern physics. But nature got there first.
Some of the most impressive quantum sensors on Earth have been common for millions of years. They help us to identify objects at great distances; they warn us about unripe food, poisons and predators; they empower us to enjoy the shimmer of jewels and rainbows, or to discern small glittering gold nuggets hidden among common stones. They are the marvellous molecules at the back of our eyeballs, whose response to incoming photons gives us our colour vision.
These two kinds of vibrations occur at vastly different rates. Sounds perceptible to humans are in the range of 20 to 20,000 hertz; that is, the vibrations occur 20 to 20,000 times per second. For reference, dogs hear higher frequencies too, up to 45,000Hz or so; hence the possibility of dog whistles. The electromagnetic vibrations in visible light occur roughly a trillion times faster."

The recent tariff war between the US and China has sent markets on a roller-coaster ride, with the tariffs on goods from each country entering the other reaching three-digit percentages earlier this month.
Where the cards will eventually fall – and who will come up on top – is still to be determined, but many restaurateurs in Hong Kong are already evaluating how the situation could affect their bottom line and, in turn, their customers’ dining experience.
According to a 2024 report from the USDA’s Agricultural Trade Office (ATO) in Hong Kong, US food and agricultural exports to Hong Kong amounted to US$1.7 billion in 2023, with beef and beef products making up the lion’s share at US$415 million.
However, chef Nate Green, who has helped open steakhouses in Hong Kong including Rex, Kilo and Henry, points out that the price of US beef has been slowly rising since the Covid pandemic – and restaurateurs have already started to look elsewhere.
Indeed, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis – one of the 12 regional reserve banks that make up the US central bank – the average price of uncooked beef steaks per pound in the US rose from US$7.65 in January 2020 to US$10.98 in March 2025."

The Indian government had sent a request for Choksi’s extradition before his arrest, but he is likely to challenge it on medical grounds, the source added.
Punjab National Bank (PNB), India’s second largest state-run lender by assets, had announced in 2018 that it had discovered alleged fraud worth US$1.8 billion at a single branch in Mumbai.
The bank had filed a criminal complaint with India’s federal investigative agency against several entities including billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi and Choksi, his uncle and the managing director of Gitanjali Gems, saying they had defrauded PNB.
Indian federal police filed fraud charges against Choksi, Nirav Modi and others in connection with suspected involvement in fraudulent transactions that led to huge losses for PNB.

Xi will spend three days in Malaysia on his first visit since 2013, meeting the country’s king, Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar, and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, with a raft of deals expected to be signed on Wednesday.
China has been Malaysia’s largest trading partner for 16 straight years, with two-way trade hitting 484.1 billion ringgit (US$110 billion) last year.
But America’s giant consumer market still buys the most Malaysian goods, spending US$45 billion last year, mostly on semiconductors key to production of high-end chips.
Tariffs of 24 per cent on most Malaysian goods threaten those crucial exports – although semiconductors appear set for a temporary reprieve.
While Trump has suspended the tariffs for 90 days, experts say Xi’s visit gives Malaysian companies the chance to look for better access to China to offset the likely pain ahead."

The growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) – smart technology that enables computers to copy human behaviour such as learning, problem-solving and decision-making – is helping to transform industries worldwide.
While some businesses have begun to adopt AI, many remain hesitant to fully integrate it into their operations. Research shows high training costs, as well as the time and expense of implementation, are key barriers to its broader adoption.
Globally, about half of e-commerce sellers are experimenting with AI, while around 30 per cent are fully integrating it into their businesses, according to last year’s “State of Commerce” study, published by the American software firm Salesforce.
However, AI’s adoption in Southeast Asia remains more cautious, with research carried out by Lazada Group, a leading online shopping platform in the region, showing that 61 per cent of retailers are sceptical about AI’s practical benefits – even though 89 per cent admit it is crucial to boost efficiency.
Its report, “Bridging the AI Gap: Online Seller Perceptions and Adoption Trends in SEA”, was published earlier this month in partnership with marketing data and analytics company Kantar Singapore.
The survey of more than 1,200 online sellers in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam shows that, while 68 per cent of online sellers in Southeast Asia demonstrate a strong familiarity with AI and regularly use these tools in their daily lives, only just over one third of respondents have actually adopted AI in their business operations."

“[Hong Kong should] accelerate the development of the Northern Metropolis and leverage the Hong Kong Science Park and Cyberport – together with the important platforms of Shenzhen, Qianhai, Hetao and Nansha – to attract enterprises in the digital economy,” he said."

Captain Helio Goncalves called for a failing and demoralised Kitchee squad to “find strength from nowhere” to help the club “rise again”.
For the second successive year, the 12-times league champions have imploded in the closing months of the season. And, like predecessor Kim Dong-jin last season, Edgar Cardoso, the head coach, has paid for the slump with his job.
Veteran defender Goncalves accepted, nonetheless, that those on the field had to share responsibility for a wretched campaign.
“It’s not only about the coach, we’re the ones on the pitch,” he said. “The fans are right to be angry, we understand their frustration. But when we are at the bottom, struggling … and down and sad, we need their support. It’s easy to support in the good moments.”
Those good moments have been few and far between since Kitchee completed a treble in 2022-23. Last season, they won only the Senior Shield. Under Cardoso this term, Kitchee have been eliminated from all three cup competitions before the final. A convincing title challenge never materialised, and recent home losses to Kowloon City and North District left them completely out of contention."

On Sunday, US President Donald Trump announced on social media that the exemption for smartphones and laptops from China would be temporary, adding that there would be a national security-related trade investigation into China’s semiconductor sector.
US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the same day that the electronic goods would be included in the upcoming semiconductor tariffs, which will come in a month or two.
“These are things that are national security, that we need to be made in America,” he said in an interview with US broadcaster ABC.
Lutnick added that the semiconductor tariffs would fall outside of Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs”, under which levies on Chinese imports soared to 125 per cent last week.
As the world’s largest semiconductor market, China has been ramping up efforts to boost its domestic chip industry in recent years amid heightened US-China tech tensions, with a growing export volume of integrated circuits (ICs), commonly known as chips.

The dollar drifted lower on Monday after an early bump off a three-year low, as investor confidence in the world’s reserve currency remained in question following a stream of tariff-related pronouncements from US President Donald Trump.
Investors braced for another volatile week as Trump’s imposition and then abrupt postponement of tariffs on goods imported to the US continued to sow confusion.
The dollar reversed early gains as the Asian trading session got under way, languishing near a 10-year low against the Swiss franc at 0.8188.
Sterling held to most of its 1.7 per cent gain from last week and stood at US$1.3099, while the New Zealand dollar rose to a four-month high of US$0.5860.
Trump on Sunday said he would announce the tariff rate on imported semiconductors over the next week, adding that there would be flexibility towards some companies in the sector.
The White House on Friday had granted an exclusion from steep tariffs for smartphones, computers and certain other electronics imported largely from China. Trump later said the move would be short-lived."

In a tight battle behind title leader John Size (47 wins) and David Hayes (41), only five wins separate Yiu (37) and the 11th-placed Cody Mo Wai-kit in the premiership standings.
Yiu, who is tied on wins with Francis Lui Kin-wai but holds the ascendancy with more seconds than last season’s champion trainer, will take a team of six runners to the city circuit on Wednesday night.
Eason continues his bid for a breakthrough win in the first section of the Class Three Violet Handicap (1,200m) after a pair of close seconds and a third from his six starts this term after switching from the Frankie Lor Fu-chuen stable.
The Written Tycoon gelding was only beaten a head when runner-up to Gustosisimo and Gallant Valour at the course and distance of his latest assignment.
He struggled on a rain-affected Valley track when fifth to Spicy Gold last month before backing up seven days later to run an eye-catching fourth to Happy Fat Cat.
“We’ve got a good jockey on in Hugh Bowman,” Yiu said.
“The horse has been running well and hopefully he finishes in the first three. He’ll be close again.”
One tough customer!

After a wide draw in barrier 11 forced him back to last on his latest appearance, Eason should get a far more economical run from gate three on Wednesday night.
He strikes an incredibly even field featuring Bundle Of Charm, Nucleozor, Chateauneuf, Storming Dragon, Crimson Flash, King Miles, Shinyu Kokoroe, California Deeply and Up With Charm.
Giant Leap jumps back into Class Three in the second section of the Violet Handicap after a tough Class Four triumph under visiting jockey Richard Kingscote last start.
While the son of Capitalist tends to struggle at this level, Yiu is optimistic he can hold his form and take advantage of dropping 15 pounds to carry 119.
“He has a light weight this time. He’s another genuine horse, especially at the Valley,” Yiu said.
“He’s held his condition since his last start, so he’ll go well. He can finish in the first three.”
In-form jockey Andrea Atzeni, who won on Giant Leap earlier this season, hops back aboard Yiu’s charge on Wednesday night but he must overcome the outside draw in the field of nine.
Yiu’s other Valley runners are Diamond Soars, Floof, Sure Joyful and Mega Bonus, who was elevated from first reserve for the second section of the Class Four Dianthus Handicap (1,200m) when Sunny Galaxy was scratched on Monday with a head injury.
Yiu is also preparing for a strong FWD Champions Day assault on Sunday week, with stable star Voyage Bubble set for the Group One Champions Mile and Straight Arron bound for the Group One QE II Cup (2,000m).
The 67-year-old had a change of heart after indicating Straight Arron would also tackle the Champions Mile after his last-start Group Three Chairman’s Trophy (1,600m) victory over Galaxy Patch.
“Last time when he ran over the mile, it was a bit short and the second horse probably should have won. I think 2,000m is his best trip,” Yiu said."

Afghan women cricketers will get high-level support in a bid to rejoin international competition after the sport’s world governing body created a task force to coordinate direct funding, elite coaching and facilities for displaced players.
Dozens of players from Afghanistan’s national women’s team relocated to Australia after the Taliban retook control of the country in 2021 and enforced bans on women’s sports. The players have been seeking official support ever since.
The International Cricket Council (ICC) released a statement on Sunday saying it reached an agreement with the sport’s national associations in Australia, India and England to support the displaced Afghan women’s players.
ICC chairman Jay Shah said his organisation is “deeply committed to fostering inclusivity and ensuring every cricketer has the opportunity to shine, regardless of their circumstances”.
“The ICC believes this [support fund] will not only help preserve the sporting careers of Afghan women cricketers but also reinforce the sport’s role as a unifying force that transcends borders and adversity,” he said.
An Afghanistan Women’s XI played a Cricket Without Borders XI at Melbourne’s Junction Oval in an exhibition match supported by the Australian government in January, bringing together 21 female players who were formerly contracted to the Afghanistan Cricket Board."

Chinatowns are often portrayed as gritty underworlds riddled with prostitution, gambling and drug trafficking. Some of this is rooted in truth, but that unfair depiction is largely the result of rampant xenophobia and cultural ignorance, especially in the West.
Thailand, the only Southeast Asian country that was never colonised by any European power, has always been a popular destination for Chinese immigrants, and its capital city of Bangkok boasts what is considered to be one of the biggest Chinatowns in the world.
The first Chinese migrants settled in Siam – the official name of Thailand before 1939 – in the 14th century, working mostly as tin miners and merchants hoping to find fortune overseas.
Pasuk writes in her 2017 book A History of Ayutthaya that, in the 1730s, a French missionary estimated there were some 20,000 Chinese people in Siam. Many of them, it was said, immigrated as single men and started families with local women, which led to a smoother assimilation into Thai society. Some even took up official positions in court."

A go-to wager in the Treasury market is seeing one of its best runs ever as investors flee long-term US bonds amid President Donald Trump’s escalating trade war.
In a sign of how Treasuries’ status as a global haven during times of turmoil may be fading, rates on longer-term debt soared last week as equities convulsed, turbocharging bets on a steeper yield curve.
The extra yield that investors demand to own 30-year Treasuries over two-year maturities has increased for nine straight weeks, a streak seen only one other time since Bloomberg began collating the data in 1992. Last week, that gap reached levels last seen in 2022, giving a boost to money managers such as DoubleLine that are positioned for such a move.
The appeal of long bonds dimmed last week in part on speculation that Trump’s tariffs will sap international demand for Treasuries at a time when already-bloated US deficits could swell further with Congress debating tax cuts. Meanwhile, with worries around the economy growing, shorter maturities fared better versus longer-dated debt because of expectations the Federal Reserve will soon lower interest rates.
For DoubleLine, anticipating an even steeper curve from two to 30 years is the way to play this dynamic.
“That’s the cleaner expression for us,” said Bill Campbell, a portfolio manager at the firm. “And it’s a curve positioning that continues to remain prudent at this time, given those longer-term factors.”"

Food, drink, reading books and raising children – everyday life in the 1600s is the focus of perhaps the biggest exhibition of the year for fans of the Dutch Old Masters.
For the celebration of Amsterdam’s 750th anniversary this year, a large private collection of Dutch Old Masters is making available 75 of its works, including 18 Rembrandts.
The “From Rembrandt to Vermeer, Masterpieces from The Leiden Collection” is on show until August 24 at the H’ART Museum in the city centre.
The museum describes the exhibition as “a unique and intimate glimpse into the 17th-century Netherlands through the eyes of the great Dutch Masters”, and depicting many women, from wealthy matrons to goddesses to ordinary citizens.
“Particularly noteworthy is the inclusion of a painting by Maria Schalcken, one of the few women in her time known to be working as a painter,” it adds."

China’s massive export machine could be looking at its “final hurrah” in March, analysts said, as shipments surged in advance of tariff increases from the United States as well as countermeasures Beijing pledged to “strictly enforce”.
Outbound merchandise shipments rose by 12.4 per cent from a year earlier to US$313.9 billion, compared to the 2.3 per cent growth recorded for January and February and the 3.53 per cent rise forecast in a poll from financial data provider Wind.
“But shipments are set to drop back over the coming months and quarters,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, adding “it could be years before Chinese exports regain current levels.”
Imports sank by 4.3 per cent year-on-year in March after a 8.4 per cent slide in the first two months of the year, according to customs data released on Monday, leading to a trade surplus of US$102.64 billion for March.
Nowhere is the landscape more blurry than China, with Trump having threatened new cumulative tariffs of 145 per cent on all Chinese goods over several escalatory rounds. This would have sent the effective tariff rate, factoring in those already in place, close to an eye-watering 156 per cent."

According to the Observatory, the city experienced its driest April morning since an automatic weather station was set up in 1984, with relative humidity falling to as low as 21 per cent.
The Post examines the sudden arrival of severe air pollution and what precautions residents should take to minimise their exposure.
Former Observatory assistant director Leung Wing-mo explained that both the low relative humidity and poor air quality were influenced by the weakened northeast monsoon.
“The low relative humidity is likely due to continental airflow and sinking air, similar to the hot and dry conditions before a typhoon, while the poor air quality is due to high levels of both sandstorm-related particulate matter and an unusually high ozone level,” Leung said.
He said the surging ozone level was likely caused by stratospheric ozone intrusion.
“This occurs when ozone from the layer of the atmosphere about 10km [6.2 miles] to 30km high descends to the ground due to sinking air,” he said. “Ozone combined with some particulate matter like PM10 and PM2.5 makes the air quality even worse.”
The Environmental Protection Department noted the airborne dust primarily consisted of PM10, or larger respirable suspended particulates. The level of PM2.5, the fine suspended particulates that pose a more direct threat to human health, was lower."

Gonzalez told chanting supporters she did not accept the results and would demand a recount, calling it “the worst and most grotesque electoral fraud in the history of Ecuador”.

The pause on duties includes smartphones, laptops and memory chips, though the Trump administration said the exemption was only temporary and a separate duty would be imposed on these items. China said the US had taken a very “small step” in rectifying its mistake and urged the White House to do more to scrap the so-called reciprocal tariffs.

Washington’s plans to exempt some electronic devices from its 125 per cent so-called “reciprocal” tariffs has provided a glimmer of hope for Chinese suppliers serving major US multinationals such as Apple and Tesla, but the road ahead for China’s vast electronics sector still appears tough, analysts and industry insiders say.
Many smaller Chinese electronics firms will not be covered by the exemptions – and the administration of US President Donald Trump is now adding further uncertainty by warning it plans to roll out new “sectoral tariffs” targeting the industry.
The latest moves have left many in China bewildered and frustrated as they search for a way forward amid the wild policy swings coming from across the Pacific.
“It’s so arbitrary,” said Chen Zhiwu, a chair professor of finance at the University of Hong Kong. “Who knows why they came out with this exemption list so quickly? Who knows how long the 145 per cent tariffs may hold?”
The move appeared to be a recognition of China’s indispensable role in the global supply chain for many hi-tech products, analysts said. China supplied over 70 per cent of the PC monitors and smartphones, and 66 per cent of the laptops imported into the US in 2024, according to figures from the US International Trade Commission."

Times of uncertainty separate true leaders from those less fit to lead. This applies to those making decisions for their families and those leading businesses, organisations and even governments. Communication is key.
We are headed into some very troubled waters, and who knows what monsters lie hidden in the deep? In such times, we need a leader who can see past our anxieties and step up to calm the public, explain the situation, reassure, unite and lead.
True leaders must work quickly in times of crisis, starting with sitting down with the people for a serious talk. Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong did exactly that on April 4. In a recorded video message on the implications of US President Donald Trump’s latest round of tariffs, Wong sent a clear message to the people of Singapore.
He also frankly admitted that “no one can say how the current situation will unfold in the coming months or years”. He outlined what it would take for Singapore to navigate through the unknown: vigilance, building up capabilities, strengthening partnerships and avoiding complacency. Most importantly, he ended with a call for unity and resolve, a reassurance that his people do have what it takes to endure."

Hong Kong industry leaders have cautioned local exporters against evading a US tariff on small parcels via illegal third-country transshipments or parallel imports, saying companies risk being prosecuted and tarnishing the city’s reputation.
They issued the warning after US President Donald Trump’s move last week to further raise the duty on small parcels sent to the country from mainland China and Hong Kong to 120 per cent, up from 90 per cent.
Trump also said he had increased the tariff on Chinese imports to 145 per cent, up from an earlier-stated 125 per cent.
Analysts anticipated that alternative business models would emerge to get around the tariff on small items, such as via illegal transshipment of goods through Mexico or Canada, or by being sold as parallel imports.
But Willy Lin Sun-mo, chairman of the Hong Kong Shippers’ Council, warned the city’s exporters against such moves, saying they could lead to serious legal consequences and damage their companies’ reputations.
“For example, for a Hong Kong firm to make a shipment of goods, it needs to state its final destination. If the goods are exported to Mexico first, then picked up by another company there for re-export to the US, the firms need to declare the origin of the goods,” he said."

Rory McIlroy turned another major collapse into his grandest moment of all, hitting a wedge into three feet for birdie in a sudden-death play-off on Sunday to finally win the Masters and take his place in golf history as the sixth player to claim the career grand slam.
What should have been a coronation for McIlroy along the back nine at Augusta National turned into a heart-racing, lead-changing jaw-dropping finish at golf’s greatest theatre that ended with McIlroy on his knees sobbing with joy and disbelief.
“I started to wonder if it would ever be my time,” McIlroy said in Butler Cabin before Scottie Scheffler helped him into the green jacket.
It ended with more heartache for Justin Rose, who lost to Sergio Garcia in a playoff in 2017 and forced this one with a clutch 20-foot birdie on the 18th hole for a six-under-par 66. He wound up joining Ben Hogan as the only players to lose twice in play-offs at Augusta National.
McIlroy lost a two-shot lead in two holes at the start. He lost a four-shot lead on the back nine in a matter of three holes with shocking misses, one of them a wedge into the tributary of Rae’s Creek on the par-5 13th.
And right when it looked as though he would blow another major, McIlroy delivered two majestic shots when nothing less would do, two birdies that sent him to the 18th hole with a one-shot lead. That still wasn’t enough. He missed a five-foot par putt for a one-over 73 and the first Masters play-off in eight years."

“Since we have seen an increasing number of financial scams and fraud, the HKMA considers it vital to introduce measures to establish a comprehensive anti-fraud system for banks and their customers to prevent their money from being lost to fraudsters,” Yuen said.
Last year, more than 44,000 scam cases were recorded in the city, according to statistics released by the police. Although the number of scam cases last year increased at a slower pace of around 12 per cent, compared with more than 40 per cent in 2023, the amount involved reached a whopping HK$9.15 billion (US$1.2 billion).
The three note-issuing banks – HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank and Bank of China (Hong Kong) – this month would introduce the “Money Safe” function, with another 11 banks joining this quarter, Yuen said."

Up to £10 billion of that support would be used specifically for firms “impacted in the short term by the current situation”, it said.

A twin-engined plane has crashed into a muddy field in upstate New York, leaving all six passengers aboard dead.
The plane, a Mitsubishi MU-2B, was reported down at noon on Saturday in Copake, New York, around 48km (30 miles) from its destination at Columbia County Airport.
Columbia County Undersheriff Jacqueline Salvatore on Saturday confirmed the crash was fatal.
“It’s in the middle of a field and it’s pretty muddy, so accessibility is difficult,” Salvatore said during a news conference near the scene, about 80km (50 miles) south of Albany.
The private plane was carrying a family of doctors and distinguished recent student-athletes, bound for a trip to the Catskills for a birthday celebration and the Passover holiday.

Kerry Brown is professor of Chinese studies at King’s College, London, whose research focuses on Chinese elite politics and its diplomatic strategies. Brown lived in the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia between 1994 and 1996 and worked as a British diplomat in Beijing from 1998 to 2005 and served as the first secretary in Beijing from 2000 to 2003.
We want to start with the latest tariff situation between China and the US. In your view, how might this affect their respective economies as well as the broader global economy? As the United States continues to exert maximum pressure on China, how should China respond strategically?
I think China was expecting this, and in many ways set in place some degree of diversification and policy response to what Trump is doing. It has markets and supplies now in the Global South and has been working on these since the start of the pandemic.
China has also been working hard on addressing its technology deficit with the US, expanding its [research and development] expenditure by 10 per cent at the National People’s Congress earlier this year, and now working on trying to decouple as far as possible from the US.
Following up with your point on decoupling. The call for US-China decoupling began during Donald Trump’s first term. Given the recent developments, would you say the two countries are now entering a phase of full decoupling? Is China at risk of becoming increasingly isolated and having to navigate this complex global environment on its own? Would you consider this period one of the darkest moments for China in terms of global trade?
I think that for the Trump administration, the Chinese must be stunned by the lack of caution and understanding that he has of how China negotiates. I cannot think of a worse tactic than threatening and presenting China with zero-sum options. This is a country, after all, with such a strong narrative in its head of never again being victimised and bullied, that everything Trump is doing is only likely to make China stand its ground even more."

These realities reflect a world engulfed in warfare. More than 110 armed conflicts are under way. Varying widely in scale, some are recent events while others began some 50 years ago, according to the Geneva Academy of International Law and Humanitarian Rights. Private “proxy military companies” compound the risks to global stability by operating with impunity through the exploitation of legal loopholes as countries’ surrogates.

Junta chief Brice Oligui Nguema celebrated a huge victory in Gabon’s presidential election on Sunday after provisional results gave him 90.35 per cent of the vote.
Oligui, who ended more than five decades of corruption-plagued rule by the Bongo family in August 2023, assuming the role of transitional president, had promised to return the country to democratic rule.
“God does not abandon his people,” Oligui told hundreds of delighted supporters at his campaign headquarters, paying tribute to what he called “the maturity of the Gabonese people”.
Interior Minister Hermann Immongault said earlier that Oligui had won a seven-year mandate with more than 575,200 votes, or 90.3 per cent, of the votes counted so far.
His main rival, Alain-Claude Bilie By Nze, took 3 per cent of the vote and six other candidates failed to win more than 1 per cent in Saturday’s election.
Even before the count was completed, the official Gabonese media had announced that Oligui was “far ahead”."

In a cable sent on Friday to all US diplomatic missions, Rubio asked that staff report any perceived discriminatory actions taken against Christians or employees advocating on their behalf between January 2021 and January 2025.
The cable, copies of which were obtained by Associated Press, said that all reported allegations would be investigated by a governmentwide task force on anti-Christian bias and if discrimination was found the culprits might be disciplined. It also made clear that allegations could be submitted anonymously."

The allegation is said to be separate from an investigation into Siddiq’s aunt, the former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, regarding a nuclear power plant deal in which the Labour MP has also been named.

“The ACC has not responded to Ms Siddiq or put any allegations to her directly or through her lawyers. Ms Siddiq knows nothing about a hearing in Dhaka relating to her and she has no knowledge of any arrest warrant that is said to have been issued,” they added.

Sudan’s paramilitaries killed 56 civilians over two days in attacks on a newly-retaken town on the road to El-Fasher, the last major city in Darfur still in army hands, activists said on Sunday.
The killings, which occurred on April 11 and 12, targeted residents in Um Kadadah, around 180km (112 miles) east of El-Fasher, “on an ethnic basis”, said the local resistance committee, part of a network of volunteers coordinating aid across Sudan since the war between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) began on April 15, 2023.
The RSF have stepped up attacks in the El-Fasher area since the army last month recaptured the capital Khartoum, around 1,000km to the east.
The committee’s report came a day after the United Nations said more than 100 people were feared dead in RSF attacks on El-Fasher and two nearby famine-hit camps for displaced people.
The attacks on Um Kadadah came one day after RSF fighters said they seized the town from army forces.
The local committee shared a list of those killed and said that the RSF committed “widespread violations” and citizens “were forcibly displaced” from the town."

Donald Trump is in “excellent health”, a White House doctor’s assessment said on Sunday, after he underwent his first annual medical check-up since returning to the US presidency.
Republican Trump, 78, has repeatedly boasted about his own vigour since starting a second term, while mocking his 82-year-old Democratic predecessor Joe Biden as decrepit and mentally unfit for office.
“President Trump exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of the Commander-in-Chief and Head of State,” read a physician’s letter shared by the White House.
It noted only a few abnormalities that included minor sun damage to Trump’s skin, as well as scarring on his right ear from a gunshot wound after he was shot at in an assassination attempt last July.

Trump followed up on the messaging later on Sunday, insisting that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair Trade Balances”. He also confirmed that electronics products to fall under the new tariff category remain subject to 20 per cent tariffs that the president slapped on all imports from China this year in a bid to push Beijing to block outbound shipments of fentanyl and the chemicals used to make the deadly opioid.
“We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations,” Trump said on social media. “What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China.”

Although the tariffs imposed on Britain are at the lower end of the US’ scale – reflecting broadly balanced trade flows between the two countries – Reynolds said he still viewed the greater trade barriers as “disappointing”.
Earlier this month, just after the tariffs were announced, Reynolds told the BBC it was “not inaccurate” to say the US and Britain had agreed the broad outline of a possible deal, although Trump had not seen it.
However, there has been little sign of progress since, and last week finance minister Rachel Reeves said she intended to meet US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent “shortly”.
Attempts to strike a bilateral trade deal during Trump’s first term in 2017-2021 ran into opposition from Britain’s Conservative government at the time over measures to lower animal welfare and environmental standards."

I do not like the current US president. I voted against Donald Trump for the third time last November. His disregard for the rule of law, democracy, pluralism, America’s alliances, and everything else that has made my country strong, special and great makes him a bitter pill to swallow. I view him as a danger to not only the United States but the world.
But broken clocks are correct twice a day. I share his disenchantment with the international trade system; it is irreparable and needs to be rebuilt. Despite being of America’s making, the system does not suit the US. It no longer serves the interests of America nor the many Global South nations whose development strategies are constrained by World Trade Organization rules outlawing the very industrial policies once used by today’s wealthy countries.
Trade accounted for 59 per cent of the world’s economy in 2023, bringing benefits to many, yet not all. Many religious believers of free trade use outdated economic ideas, such as David Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage, to explain how everyone benefits from trade and to justify their dogmatic disaffinity for any sort of trade intervention.
But we do not live in a world where countries focus on what they are good at producing and trade for things they are not. Countries do not export wholly to pay for imports; instead, they tinker with income distribution, transferring income away from those who consume most of theirs (average households) to those that save most of their income (elites, businesses, the state). This inflates savings relative to investment, and production relative to spending, forcing these economies into structural trade surpluses.
Yet what of the deficit countries? They absorb the excess production and savings of surplus countries. This lowers their domestic production, as local firms cannot compete with artificially cheap imports. Deficit countries then face two options: do nothing and accept higher unemployment, or respond and incur higher debt."

Concerns over earthquakes have contributed to a decline in the number of Hong Kong residents joining tour groups to some popular Asian destinations this Easter, despite prices falling by as much as 15 per cent over last year’s level, one of the city’s largest travel agents has said.
Steve Huen Kwok-chuen, executive director of EGL Tours, also told a radio programme on Sunday that tour group prices were decreasing due to the stronger Hong Kong dollar and cheaper flights as the cost of jet fuel fell and airline passenger capacity increased.
“For a six-day trip to Japan, prices range from about HK$10,000 [US$1,290] to HK$13,000 this year, down from HK$10,000 to HK$16,000 last year, which is quite a marked decline,” he said.
When asked about the effects of recent earthquakes on tour group bookings, Huen said: “If we compare Easter this year with last year, there is a slight single percentage point contraction, which may be due to factors that are uncertain to everyone.
“Everyone will think about [the quakes], but the impact is not too big.”
A 5.6-magnitude quake struck near Meiktila, a small city in central Myanmar, on Sunday morning, although there were no immediate reports of major damage or casualties.
On March 28, the country was rocked by a 7.7-magnitude quake that killed more than 3,500 people and was felt as far away as Bangkok, where a skyscraper under construction near the popular Chatuchak Weekend Market collapsed."

Hong Kong’s Democratic Party, once a powerful opposition force in the city’s political landscape, is a step closer to disbanding after nearly all of the members attending an extraordinary meeting authorised the leadership to go ahead with the plan.
Chairman Lo Kin-hei said on Sunday that more than 110 people attended the 1½-hour meeting, with some also representing other members.
Over 90 per cent endorsed the proposal for the party’s central committee to “proceed with the arrangements and follow-up of the dissolution”.
The move puts the 30-year-old party one step closer to disbanding.
“This is not the final decision that the party is dissolving. But, in the coming few months, I hope there will be another general meeting [in which] we will get that motion into debate and vote,” he said.
He said he could not guarantee the party would be able to stick to the timeline, but he expected that more members would be able to attend the next meeting and many would vote in favour of the disbandment."

Red-hot favourite for the first Griffin race of the season, the Racing For Charity Plate (1,000m), two-year-old The All Out controlled things from the front on the outside rail down the Sha Tin straight.
After shrugging off pressure from Hyannis Star 300m out, The All Out looked poised for a comfortable victory under Zac Purton before Quick Money flashed late to get within a short head on the line.
The third-placed Babieca was a whopping six and a half lengths off the quinella pair.
“I would have liked to see him win a little easier, but a win’s a win. He’s got more improvement to come – he’s a big, strong horse and he’ll improve with more racing,” said trainer Jamie Richards.

“It didn’t go exactly to plan, he got a bit softened up in front and the horse that ran second got an easy time of it and was going to be strong late after trialling well at Conghua earlier in the week.
“But The All Out’s got more scope for improvement yet, so hopefully he can go on with the job.”
Richards’ victory in the first of 2025’s Griffin races, which are run for southern hemisphere two-year-olds and northern hemisphere three-year-olds, took him to 13 wins for the campaign.
While jockey Jerry Chau Chun-lok had to settle for second aboard Quick Money, he was right in the money aboard the Frankie Lor Fu-chuen-trained Dream Winner in the Class Three Nurturing Talent Handicap (1,000m).
Not only did Dream Winner reward his supporters with victory at a massive $66.3, he also lead in a string of enormous exotics in Sha Tin’s ninth event.
The second placing of Manfred Man Ka-leung’s Magic Hallow at win odds of $103 ensured the quinella paid an eye-watering $25,905 and the forecast a mind-boggling $49,241.
Sparkling Fellow ran third at $22 to complete a $65,503 trio and a huge $739,695 tierce.
While hot favourite Justifying filled fourth at $1.2, the quartet still came in at a massive $1,291,048.
While Dream Winner’s victory was his first in almost two years after he started his career with three straight successes, it continued a recent run of vastly improved form from Chau.
After snapping a run of 74 rides without a victory aboard Chateau Le Peche last Sunday, Chau booted Northern Fire Ball to victory at Happy Valley during the week before cashing in again on Sunday.
He sits on 15 winners after 62 of the season’s 88 meetings.
The Jockey Club unveiled its refurbished Racing Talent Training Centre (RTTC) training stable at Sha Tin on Friday, with the facility ushering in a “new era of developing the next generation of horsemen and horsewomen”.
The new training stable “embodies a commitment to excellence and a future filled with promise for Hong Kong’s world-class horse racing industry”.
“Ever since it opened in 2008, the RTTC stable has been fundamental to talent development at the club,” said Jockey Club chief executive Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges.
“It represents our commitment to nurturing the very best talent and to achieving the highest standards of equine management and care – all of which are essential to our world-class racing.
“This commitment goes back to the establishment of the Apprentice Jockey School in 1972.
“World-class champion trainers Tony Cruz, Francis Lui [Kin-wai] and Ricky Yiu [Poon-fai] are all graduates from the school.
“Others, such as Matthew Chadwick, Vincent Ho [Chak-yiu], Derek Leung [Ka-chun] and Matthew Poon [Ming-fai], are currently pursuing highly successful careers in the saddle.
“No less essential is the daily care and management of racehorses. Recognising this, in 2005 the club established the Racing Development Board, which in 2022 was rebranded as the Racing Talent Training Centre.
“Over the past two decades, the RTTC has provided vocational and skills training to non-riding professionals. Many have gone on to enjoy highly successful careers as assistant trainers, head lads, stable assistants, farriers, and in many other roles.
“I sincerely hope every trainee who benefits from its outstanding facilities will go on to enjoy a fulfilling and successful career with the club. I hope they will join with us to take Hong Kong’s world-class racing to even greater heights of excellence.”
Upgrades have been completed on the stable facilities and the classroom, with new horse stalls installed and the wash-down bay redesigned to provide a comfortable environment for horses."

His latest success crowned a double for So after With A Smile broke through in the Class Four Thriving Youth Handicap (1,400m) and handed the trainer his 400th win in Hong Kong.

“It’s good to celebrate,” a delighted So said after reaching the milestone.
The 56-year-old handler has plenty of reasons to be excited about the future with Hong Lok Golf, who arguably should be unbeaten after a luckless second in his only career defeat.
Sunday’s race developed into a two-horse war between $4.85 second favourite Hong Lok Golf and the $1.9 favourite Light Years Charm, with both four-year-olds making their runs from midfield to loom as strong chances in the straight.
Light Years Charm looked to have a slight edge in momentum on the outside under Zac Purton, but Hong Lok Golf responded to Harry Bentley’s urgings to prevail by a head. Third placegetter Endeared was more than a length behind in third.
“He’s a good horse,” So said of Hong Lok Golf.
“[Bentley] said we need to step up [to a mile]. I said ‘I think we try to win one more 1,400m and then step up next time’.
“He never gave up and when Zac’s horse was coming I thought ‘oh no’, but my horse when under the whip, he still kept going. It was an impressive win. It seems like he’ll keep improving and he seems like a good horse. We’ll try our best to push where the limit is.”
While So’s emerging galloper denied Purton a third winner to end the 11-race card, the trainer and champion jockey were in the winners’ enclosure together when With A Smile notched his first victory at start four.
Despite being trapped three-wide without cover from gate 12, With A Smile kept on strongly and held off the fast-finishing Max Que to win by a short head.
“I think he keeps improving,” So said of the three-year-old.
“The last time after 1,200m [when third to Little Paradise], Zac told me ‘maybe step him up’ and I said ‘name me the date, I’ll make him available for you’.
“I think he needs further but we’ll take it step by step. Sometimes when they step up straight away, the horse won’t perform. That’s been my experience.”"

The Chinese authorities have called for more investment in spectator sports, urging financial institutions to support the sector.
New guidelines called for lenders and local governments to invest in facilities for athletes and spectators to help boost the economy.
The initiative to support “business models that integrate sports with culture, tourism, and healthcare” was announced on Friday by the central bank, the General Administration of Sport, the National Financial Regulatory Administration and the China Securities Regulatory Commission.
The guidelines encouraged financial institutions to work with sports event organisers, especially for international events, and support everything from loans and insurance to currency exchange.
They also offered support for issuing corporate bonds for projects with large investment scales and long payback periods, such as infrastructure, stadiums, sports parks, and fitness trails.
They also vowed to support stock market listings for sports industry firms, as well as encouraging private equity to invest.
The guidelines said the goal was to “optimise the financing function of the bond market, build an equity financing model, improve insurance quality, provide flexible financing leasing services and support companies to expand overseas businesses”."

Matching his only other three-timer in November 2023 at Happy Valley, the 28-year-old struck on Tony Cruz’s duo Parents’ Love and Gustosisimo before claiming his first Class One triumph aboard Francis Lui Kin-wai’s Divano in the Healthy Community Handicap (1,200m).
“I’ve got a treble in Happy Valley before but never Sha Tin – always a double,” Chung said.
“It’s great to get a chance on good horses. Today is a success.”
What a win, Divano! 🔥@angusylchung snaps up a three-timer at Sha Tin as champion trainer Francis Lui finishes one-two in the Class 1 feature with Patch Of Theta second... #LoveRacing | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/vc03zFZ6to
Chung’s campaign has been stymied by a lack of opportunities and a nasty fall in February that left him with a fractured facial bone.
However, the reigning Tony Cruz Award winner bounced back with four winners in March before his big haul on Sunday.
Divano capitalised on a light weight of 112 pounds, with Lui utilising Chung’s three-pound claim, to continue his impressive form with a third victory this term.
Chung had the son of Brave Smash perfectly placed in third position and he kept on gamely once striking the lead approaching the 200m.
Sent off a $6.5 chance, Divano saluted by a length from stablemate and $2.1 favourite Patch Of Theta, who also had a cosy run just off the leaders but was no match for the winner. Taj Dragon was third.
“I spoke to Divano’s owner and trainer many, many times. I’ve been looking to ride the horse for a while and I’m glad I got the opportunity,” Chung said.
Divano added Sunday’s win to a campaign that has also featured a pair of 1,200m triumphs and a barnstorming second to My Wish in January’s Classic Mile.
“I think he keeps improving little by little,” Lui said of the four-year-old.
“He’s more relaxed and once he relaxes, he can have a good turn of foot. In the Classic Mile, I think he learnt from that race.”
Chung teamed up with his mentor Cruz to make all on Parents’ Love in the Class Four JC Echoes Of Love Fund Handicap (1,000m) before lifting Gustosisimo to victory in the Class Two Hong Kong Jockey Club Community Trophy (1,200m).
Stalking a farcical speed duel between Glory Elite and Lady’s Choice, Gustosisimo kept on strongly to beat a brave Lady’s Choice by three-quarters of a length.
“The pace was quick today and really beneficial for him and probably the track is suiting horses in front today, so the situation just suited him,” Chung said.
A three-time winner in Australia pre-import, Gustosisimo had only raced twice at Sha Tin before when trained by Jamie Richards last term before notching two wins at the Valley for Cruz.
“I didn’t have an option – there’s no more Happy Valley races,” Cruz said.

Thousands marked the start of Myanmar’s water festival on Sunday in the ruins of last month’s earthquake, with the country’s most raucous holiday muted by the tragedy of the tremor.
The ‘Thingyan’ festival typically celebrates Myanmar’s new year with water-splashing rituals symbolising cleansing and renewal, but the central cities of Mandalay and Sagaing lie devastated from the 7.7-magnitude quake.
Two weeks on from the disaster which killed more than 3,600, hundreds are still living in tent encampments peppered among pancaked apartment blocks, razed tea shops and demolished hotels.
Early on Sunday families were buying clay pots and plant sprigs customarily placed inside homes to welcome the new year, even though some had nowhere to put them.
“My heart is heavy. Our neighbourhood used to come together to celebrate Thingyan but we cannot do it this year,” said 55-year-old Ma Phyu, camping with nine family members north of Mandalay’s quake-damaged Royal Palace.
Her grandchildren usually pester her to buy them squirt guns, but this year she has nothing to offer."

China’s table tennis stars have descended on Macau for this week’s World Cup, with the country firm favourites to continue their utter dominance of the competition – although all fans can talk about is Sun Yingsha and Wang Chuqin.
World No 1s Lin Shidong and Sun will lead the charge in the men’s and women’s tournaments, battling for the Evans Cup and Hammarlund Cup, respectively.
Some 96 players – 48 men and 48 women – were split into 16 groups of three during Sunday’s draw at the Galaxy Arena, and with triple champion Ma Long not defending his men’s crown, fan favourite Wang will be among those hoping to replace him.
Hong Kong, meanwhile, are represented by Wong Chun-ting on the men’s side and Doo Hoi-kem and Zhu Chengzhu in the women’s. But with only one player progressing from each group, the trio could struggle to reach the knockout stage.
Wong has been placed alongside China’s Liang Jingkun and Australia’s Nicholas Lum, while Doo would need to take down Japan’s world No 5 Miwa Harimoto. Zhu has been grouped with China’s Kui Man.
In all, China have sent 10 players to the World Cup – five men and five women – but fans have focused their attention on just two, Sun and Wang."

Scott Fitzgerald classic is riffed on by Claire Anderson-Wheeler, with Jay Gatsby’s sister Greta looking into the death of Tom Buchanan
If you polled 100 people about who is the most awful among the awful people in The Great Gatsby, I bet 99 of them would answer “that louse Tom Buchanan”. In the new book The Gatsby Gambit, Buchanan finally gets what’s coming to him.
Daisy Buchanan’s loathsome husband is murdered early on in Claire Anderson-Wheeler’s mystery novel that is timed to capitalise on the centenary of The Great Gatsby, which fell on April 10, 2025.
North Dakotan-turned-dreamy-poor-little-rich-boy Jay Gatsby is around in The Gatsby Gambit, but the new book’s protagonist is his hitherto unknown sister, Greta. Her name, you’ll note, is an anagram of “Great” and, between her wit and her insightful suspicion of her brother’s dissolute pals, the character is indeed another great Gatsby.
With F. Scott Fitzgerald’s timeless characters now in the public domain, we are getting lots of fresh takes on them, including several graphic novel versions, a book called Nick that puts The Great Gatsby’s narrator Nick Carraway at its centre, and a comic book that pits Jay Gatsby against Godzilla in Godzilla’s Monsterpiece Theatre.
Anderson-Wheeler isn’t the stylist that Fitzgerald was – not many are – but she understands his characters. That understanding informs The Gatsby Gambit, which smartly recognises that star-crossed lovers Jay and Daisy were never meant to be, even with Tom conveniently out of the picture.
Anderson-Wheeler also knows that happiness may never be on the cards for any of these characters, despite their wealth and beauty."

Russian missiles struck the heart of the Ukrainian city of Sumy as people gathered to celebrate Palm Sunday, killing at least 34 people, officials said, in the second large-scale attack to claim civilian lives in just over a week.
The two ballistic missiles struck at around 10.15am, officials said.
Images from the scene showed lines of black body bags on the side of the road, while more bodies were seen wrapped in foil blankets among the debris. Video footage also showed fire crews fighting to extinguish the shells of burnt-out cars among the rubble from damaged buildings.
The dead included two children, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine said in a statement. A further 117 people were wounded, including 15 children, it said.
“Only filthy scum can act like this – taking the lives of ordinary people,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said.
The head of the Ukrainian president’s office, Andriy Yermak, said the strike also used cluster munitions in an attempt to kill as many people as possible. Associated Press was unable to verify the claim."

The base, located near Rambilli village, will serve as a hub for India’s warships and nuclear-powered submarines, according to local media, enhancing its ability to project power in an increasingly contested region.
The facility will support India’s fleet of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, including the new INS Aridhaman, according to Walter Ladwig, a senior international-relations lecturer at King’s College London who specialises in South Asian security.
“It would enhance the [navy’s] ability while maintaining operational secrecy for their nuclear submarine fleet, which is crucial for a secure second-strike capability.”
The commissioning of the base at Rambilli coincides with plans to introduce the INS Aridhaman, India’s third nuclear-powered submarine equipped with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles, later this year. The 7,000-tonne vessel is larger than its predecessors, the INS Arihant and INS Arighaat, which currently form the backbone of India’s nuclear deterrent at sea.
It comes against the backdrop of escalating competition between New Delhi and Beijing for strategic influence in the Indian Ocean and broader Indo-Pacific region."

Unlike sporting teams that forgo their treasured home ground advantage when playing away from home, touring orchestras can reap the benefits of performing at venues with better acoustics than their own.
That was the case recently when the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra performed in the acoustically bright Concert Hall of the National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA) in Beijing with Estonian conductor Paavo Järvi at the helm and Bomsori Kim as violin soloist.
To hear the Hong Kong Phil at a superior venue is to be reminded of the infamous sound anomalies of the orchestra’s “home turf”, the Hong Kong Cultural Centre’s cavernous Concert Hall on the Tsim Sha Tsui harbourfront.
The concert of works by Arvo Pärt and Sergei Prokofiev, also performed in Hong Kong on April 4, was a celebration of “pure” music that resonated with marked clarity in the Chinese capital’s main concert venue, referred to by some as “China’s Carnegie Hall” since it opened in 2007.
Immediately west of the Great Hall of the People and Tiananmen Square, “The Giant Egg” as the massive centre designed by French architect Paul Andreu is colloquially known, encases the hall, which also boasts the largest organ in the country."

Parkinson’s disease has emerged as one of the fastest-growing neurological disorders worldwide, with experts projecting a dramatic surge in cases of the progressive brain disorder over the coming decades.
A recent study published in the BMJ medical journal predicts that the number of people affected worldwide could more than double – from 11.9 million in 2021 to over 25 million by 2050.
While Parkinson’s often reveals itself through visible signs such as tremors, slowed movement and trouble with balance, experts say the disease starts developing long before symptoms appear – in what is known as the “silent phase”.
This makes early detection and preventive care especially important.
Parkinson’s occurs when nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine – a chemical crucial for movement – begin to die."

When Alida Guo first discovered Liu Cixin’s groundbreaking sci-fi novel The Three-Body Problem in high school, she was captivated. The plot proved so irresistible that she hid a copy behind her history textbooks, turning classes into covert missions to decode the “Trisolaran crisis” – named after the fictional alien civilisation that threatens Earth.
“The physics element went over my head, but the story stuck with me – it’s so Chinese that it resonates, yet so visionary that it challenges how we see tomorrow. That’s why sci-fi matters,” said Guo, who is now 24 years old and works at a robotics company in the southern city of Shenzhen.
Like many Chinese of her generation, Guo discovered science fiction through the award-winning 2008 novel – the first in Liu Cixin’s Remembrance of Earth’s Past trilogy.
It became her gateway into the sci-fi world, inspiring her to explore more books, TV series and films in the popular genre.
The industry saw 108.96 billion yuan (US$15 billion) in revenue in 2024, a 65.4 per cent increase compared to five years earlier, according to a report released on March 29 at the annual China Science Fiction Convention in Beijing."

The notion that the Panama Canal is under China’s influence is a “total misperception”, a top official from the Central American nation has said, adding that his country must explain this to the new US administration.
Asked by the Post about the role US-China tensions had played in Panama’s decisions over the canal and the initiative, Mann said: “The perception of the US administration is that the canal has fallen under the influence of China, which is a total misperception, because no foreign country has any impact or any difference on the administration of the canal.”
In the past month, Beijing has piled pressure on CK Hutchison to cancel the deal, signalling that it considers the sale of such strategic assets a threat to national security. The ports are also in Washington’s crosshairs, with US President Donald Trump previously threatening to seize the canal, claiming it was controlled by Beijing."

Various methods are deployed to clean up oil spills, including the use of absorbent materials to soak up oil to separate it from water.
Bio-based absorbents, such as cotton and fruit peels, are cost-effective and environmentally friendly materials, but they often have low absorption capacity, limited water repellent properties and poor reusability.
“This study used natural porous sphagnum moss as a raw material to develop a novel, economical, efficient, and easily recoverable adsorbent via surface modification,” the team said in a paper published in the peer-reviewed journal Scientific Reports on April 6.
The oil absorbent, developed by researchers from Guizhou Education University, was made by treating the abundant plant material sphagnum moss with chemicals to alter its properties, resulting in an oil absorption capacity that outperformed conventional bio-based absorbents."

“I will continue to work hard in the future and hope to achieve more good results.”

Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po highlighted measures the city would take in his weekly blog on Sunday after US President Donald Trump imposed an additional tariff of up to 145 per cent on goods from mainland China and Hong Kong, and raised charges for US-bound small parcels as a trade war between Washington and Beijing escalated.
Other steps include support for small and medium-sized enterprises through the provision of liquidity by local banks and greater risk protection via the Hong Kong Export Credit Insurance Corporation.
“Even if Washington slightly adjusts its measures, it has not made any fundamental changes and investors’ pessimism remains,” Chan said.
Earlier in the day, the financial secretary delivered a speech at the opening of the four-day Business of Innovation and Technology Week, saying Hong Kong’s arms were wide open for business.
“We gather at a pivotal moment,” he said to VIPs and guests. “We are witnessing a shifting global landscape marked by a daunting trade war and technological fragmentation. Trade patterns, industrial chains, supply chains and partnerships are being reshaped. In this ‘new normal’, many businesses will have to find new collaborators, explore untapped markets and embrace more agile business models.”"

We recall them and how they were received
Director Gordon Chan Kar-seung (Beast Cops) wanted to reshape the Hong Kong police film genre with 1994’s The Final Option, and the result was a classic. Lesser sequels followed.
A classic of 1990s Hong Kong cinema, The Final Option is action filmmaking of the highest order. The story about the Royal Hong Kong Police force’s Special Duty Unit (SDU), has a gripping storyline, believable characterisations and some excellent tactical assault sequences.
“Finally, a crime story that is intelligently scripted, directed and acted,” said the Post’s review.
“What distinguishes The Final Option is that Chan chooses to deal with his material in a more realistic fashion, underplaying the combat and emphasising the interpersonal drama. The emotional subtext is particularly mature for a Cantonese movie.”
What made the film different in 1994 was the extended focus Chan gave the personal lives of the SDU team.
Young recruit Ho (Peter Yung Kam-cheong) is in a troubled relationship with May (Carman Lee Yeuk-tung), who is best friends with Stone’s fiancée, who worries about the commander being shot every second of the day.
The personal elements are expertly woven into the plot and depict how personal problems can influence, usually negatively, the way police officers do their jobs."

Investors should diversify and pay closer attention to alternative assets amid stock market volatility caused by the tariff war, according to experts.
As US President Donald Trump acts on his campaign promises, including tariff increases that have heightened tensions between the US and its global trading partners, especially China, investment specialists are warning against making rash decisions given the markets’ unpredictability.
“This is a timely opportunity to diversify into alternative [assets] such as private credit, private equity and hedge funds,” said Samuel Rhee, co-founder and chairman of Endowus, a Singapore-based investment platform.
He added that private credit funds offer stability, as their assets were less correlated to market volatility, allowing for more secure long-term investments.

China raises tariffs on US goods to 125% as Xi calls on EU to resist ‘unilateral bullying’
Trump fired the first salvo in the current trade war, announcing so-called reciprocal tariffs on America’s trading partners on April 2, including a 34 per cent levy on China, which has run a massive trade surplus with the US. The back-and-forth retaliation between Washington and Beijing has pushed US tariffs on Chinese goods to 145 per cent and on US exports to the mainland to 125 per cent.
These developments saw Hong Kong’s benchmark stock index sink 13.2 per cent on April 6, its worst showing since the Asian financial crisis in October 1997. The Hang Seng Index eventually lost 8.5 per cent last week, the most in five years. Markets on the mainland and across the globe also slumped as a result of the trade war."

Only 21 months after being sent on loan to Sham Shui Po, Ngan Cheuk-pan has targeted a place in the Hong Kong team who will take on Manchester United next month.
Ngan has returned to parent team Kitchee this season, and become an international mainstay under Hong Kong head coach Ashley Westwood.
The midfielder’s contract expires this summer and he said he was “open to other options”, but there was no question over the 27-year-old’s plans for May 30, when the city team host the Premier League club at Hong Kong Stadium.
Chief among his goals was to follow in the footsteps of former Kitchee midfielder Lam Ka-wai, who scored for his club side in a 5-2 defeat at the hands of United when the former European champions last visited the city 12 years ago.
Ngan was especially savouring the prospect of a “match-up” with United’s attacking midfielder, Bruno Fernandes, should they both play.
“If I’m playing, we’ll be directly against each other,” Ngan said. “He’s a special player, really exciting and skilful, and he can make passes others can’t. I want to learn from him and, hopefully, bring that into the Asian Cup qualifier [against India on June 10].”"

The “tariff bomb” unleashed by US President Donald Trump continues to send shock waves across the globe.
As nations scramble to respond, anxiety is also growing within the US itself. Americans concerned about rising prices have begun stockpiling certain imported products – and among the items is South Korean sunscreen.
The Washington Post on Thursday published a list of eight products seeing increased demand in the US, based on trends from social media and online communities. South Korean sunscreen made the list thanks to its ability to meet three criteria: It blocks UV rays, has a pleasant texture and layers well with other make-up and cosmetics.
According to the report, unlike Europe and Asia – where sunscreens are regulated as cosmetics – the United States classifies them as drugs. This restricts the inclusion of skin-tone-enhancing ingredients and limits the number of filters American scientists can use.
As a result, South Korean sunscreens offer a wider range of cosmetic benefits, making them a popular alternative.

For those who love experiential dining, Gaggan Anand is well known.
Anand, born in Kolkata, India, not only put the Thai capital on the progressive dining map, he also pushed the boundaries of Indian cuisine and its perception around the world. The chef was featured in the second season of Netflix’s Chef’s Table in 2018.
Anand’s journey began in hotel kitchens in India before he moved to Thailand in 2007, where he was appointed executive chef of Red, an Indian fine-dining restaurant in Bangkok.
He launched Gaggan in 2010, and described it as a laboratory for his radical culinary reinventions. In the space of a few years, his 25-course emoji menu – where each course was defined not by a name but by one of the tiny pictograms – featuring dishes such as Lick It Up, which required diners to eat with their tongues, propelled the restaurant to number one on Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants list and earned it two Michelin stars."

Hong Kong international Shinichi Chan was the unlikely hero with a winner deep into stoppage time as Shanghai Shenhua beat visiting Zhejiang Greentown 3-2 in the Chinese Super League on Saturday.
Chan was only called upon in the 63rd minute to replace Xu Haoyang and the left-back found the net in the 98th minute to give his side their fourth win in six matches this season.
Speaking afterwards, the 22-year-old said he did not expect to be his side’s match winner.
“Usually it’s Yu [Hanchao], so it felt good it was my turn today,” the former Kitchee player said. “After I scored, I was thinking how to celebrate but my head was totally blank.
“Of course, we want to win more comfortably, this is what we need to focus on. We have our next two league matches [against Qingdao Hainiu and Wuhan Three Towns], we want to make sure we grab the maximum six points in front of the home fans.”
Joao Teixeira had given the hosts a 1-0 lead at half-time with a 21st minute effort and that was how it remained until a frantic final 20 minutes in which Chan played a leading role."

The immersive exhibition that completely takes over the gallery space’s surfaces also rings with political urgency. It is a particularly memorable comeback for a person once widely regarded as Hong Kong’s most prominent contemporary artist.
In 2014, when he was chosen to represent Hong Kong at the 56th Venice Biennale, Tsang was best known for his wallpapers that concealed Cantonese swear words in elegant floral patterns. Such playful symbols of hybridity morphed into something more sombre in Venice, where his exhibition “The Infinite Nothing” included powerful videos and projections about how human history is trapped in endless, recurring cycles.
Born in mainland China in 1976, Tsang moved to Hong Kong in 1982 with his family and studied art at the Chinese University of Hong Kong before pursuing a master’s degree in book art in London."

A slowdown in Chinese consumer spending on luxury goods is affecting high-end malls in Beijing and Shanghai, with shopping centres like Parkview Green and K11 slashing rents and courting mid-market retailers to attract middle-class shoppers and stem rising vacancy rates.
Shanghai K11, an 11-year-old luxury mall owned by the family of Hong Kong billionaire Henry Cheng Kar-shun, was easing its tenant criteria as rental income continued to fall, a source told the Post, declining to provide details on rents.
In Beijing, Parkview Green, a landmark shopping complex in the central business district known for its pyramid-like structure and extensive art collection, announced in March that it planned to attract more diverse restaurant operators to “reignite its commercial potential” following the exit of high-end brands like Rolex and Ermanno Scervino.
Hong Kong’s Parkview Group, the property’s owner, put it up for sale last December as it struggled with high mortgage payments and lacklustre occupancy rates, according to a Bloomberg report.
“What Parkview Green represents is a type of property that was once positioned as premium, but with the challenges facing high-end consumption in China today, its brand structure and tenant mix need to be adjusted,” said Tin Sun, northern China head of research at CBRE."

Australian avocado exporters could soon benefit from the country’s improved trade ties with China.
After a decade-long wait, the popular fruit was finally close to entering Beijing’s pipeline for import negotiations. Before that, Canberra has to select the fruit as part of its priority list. Meanwhile, industry players from Australia have also participated in technical cooperation in China’s burgeoning avocado sector.
Canberra would first negotiate access to the Chinese market for apples and blueberries, while Beijing aimed to introduce jujube and kiwi fruits to Australia.
The Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry had initially informed domestic producers that negotiations for the country’s apples would likely be completed by the first quarter.

Head coach Edgar Cardoso has been told his time at Kitchee is coming to an end after he oversaw the club’s first season without a trophy in more than a decade.
The Portuguese, who will stay in charge until his contract expires this summer, learned his fate in a meeting with club president Ken Ng Kin after a 2-1 home loss to North District last week.
He revealed the news moments after a dire 4-0 defeat at Lee Man on Saturday, as the club’s supporters noisily called for his removal.
“I’m out of Kitchee at the end of the season,” Cardoso said. “It’s mainly the club’s decision. I had very good intentions to play good football, to entertain the fans, but the fans are not entertained.
“My contract is coming to an end, so it was an easy decision for the club to not renew.”
Cardoso, whose last game in charge will be against Eastern on May 25, was installed last summer following the exit of predecessor Kim Dong-jin, who lasted only eight months after he replaced 2022-23 treble winning boss Alex Chu Chi-kwong."

Britain is sending its largest naval strike group in years on an eight-month mission across the Indo-Pacific, with the aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales at the helm of a 12-nation force that will pass through waters near India, Southeast Asia, South Korea and Japan.
While the deployment aims to project power and deter rivals such as China, Russia and North Korea, observers said it also reflects growing anxiety among US allies in Asia over the direction of American foreign policy under President Donald Trump – and the desire of European partners to help fill potential gaps.
“This is clearly global messaging to all sides,” said Garren Mulloy, a professor of international relations at Daito Bunka University in Japan. “If you had asked me three months ago, I would have said this deployment was primarily aimed at China, Russia and North Korea – and to show that Nato forces can be deployed globally.”
Now, he added, “the elephant in the room” was the Trump administration.
The mission – code-named Operation Highmast – is described by the British Ministry of Defence as the “most ambitious deployment” of its kind since 2021. Nearly 5,000 personnel from Nato members and partner nations including France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Denmark will take part.
HMS Prince of Wales is due to set sail from Portsmouth on April 22. After initial drills in the Mediterranean, the strike group will transit the Suez Canal for joint exercises with Indian forces. Operations with Malaysian and Indonesian militaries are planned in June, followed by a port call in Darwin, northern Australia."

Yunus also sought Chinese support to advance Bangladesh’s textile, pharmaceutical and renewable energy sectors.
Hasina had helped strengthen India’s access to its northeastern states and the Bay of Bengal. In November 2023, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the inauguration of two rail links that India had helped fund – Akhaura-Agartala and Khulna-Mongla Port. The former, which passes through Bangladesh, cuts travel time between two Indian cities, Agartala and Kolkata, from 31 to 10 hours, bypassing the congested Siliguri Corridor.
These links bolster their economic and strategic ties, enable smoother military and trade transits, and make Bangladesh India’s top subcontinental trading partner."

Asian Football Confederation president Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa, on Saturday opposed a South American request to expand the 2030 World Cup to 64 teams, saying such increases in numbers would lead to “chaos”.
The centenary edition, hosted by Spain, Portugal and Morocco with three matches also being staged in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay, is already set to welcome 48 teams – a far cry from the 13 in the inaugural event in Uruguay in 1930.
“Personally, I don’t agree,” the Bahraini leader told AFP, adding the 2030 edition had settled on 48 teams “so the matter is settled”.
His counterpart from South American football’s governing body Conmebol, Alejandro Dominguez, on Thursday called on Fifa to expand the event in a one-off gesture.
He also asked for South America to host the first round of one of the groups, instead of just three matches.
The global event is expected to expand from 32 to 48 teams at the 2026 World Cup, hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico."

Hong Kong’s four-time Olympic medallist Siobhan Haughey made a winning return to competitive swimming on Saturday, but said her journey back to the top was “gonna be very long”.
The 27-year-old won the women’s 100 metres breaststroke final at Hong Kong’s Long Course Swimming Time Trial, coming home in one minute and 8.49 seconds. In second was 15-year-old Eunis Man Wui-kiu, with a personal best time of 1:09.38. Claire Cheung Wing-yi, 16, finished third in 1:11.31.
Haughey said despite feeling “mentally fresh”, there had been a significant drop off in her times after a three-month break from a sport that has made her Hong Kong’s most decorated athlete.
“It was tough, but it’s good to be back,” Haughey said. “The first few days of training felt great, and then suddenly it just hit me, I was like, ‘Oh my goodness, I am so tired’.”
After a 2024 campaign that saw Haughey win two 200m world titles and Olympic bronze in both the 200m and 100m freestyle, in December the Hongkonger revealed she would be taking a break to assess her future.
Last month, Haughey’s coach Tom Rushton told the Post she had decided to fight for her sixth world championship title in Singapore in July and would be at the National Games in November."

Head coach Simon Willis said Hong Kong cricket would have a period of reflection, then “decide how we want to move forwards”, after another disappointing tournament.
Rain ruined Hong Kong’s chances of reaching the final of their home quadrangular T20 tournament, after the heavens opened when the hosts, batting first, were 68 for three against Nepal on Saturday.
Willis refused to blame the wet skies over Tin Kwong Road Recreation Ground for his side’s exit, after they lost to Kuwait in their opening match on Wednesday.
“In tournaments, you can’t leave it to lady luck, you have to determine your own fate by winning games early,” Willis said, adding it was the third time since his appointment in March 2023 that “we’ve gone out of competitions because of rain”.
Hong Kong have been relegated to the undercard of Sunday’s action, with their morning third-place playoff against Qatar the appetiser for Nepal against Kuwait in the final.
The Qataris lost all three of their group matches, including a 68-run thumping by Hong Kong on Thursday.
“We did OK against Qatar, but we’re not where I expect, given the talent in the group,” Willis said. “They don’t realise how good they are, but they have to take responsibility, and show commitment and focus, to achieve the things they want.”"

The recent tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump have increased the risk of higher unemployment and are likely to cause inflation to rise and growth to slow, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday.
“It is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected,” Powell told an event in Virginia in prepared remarks.
“The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,” he said, adding that it was “too soon” to consider making changes to US monetary policy.

His comments suggest the Fed is in no rush to cut its benchmark lending rate from its current elevated level of between 4.25 and 4.5 per cent, as it continues its struggle to bring inflation down to its long-term 2 per cent target.
Trump’s announcement earlier this week of heavy levies against top trading partners has rocked global markets as investors have grappled with the prospect of significantly higher import costs on everything from shoes to shrimp.
But ahead of Powell’s speech on Friday, Trump took to his Truth Social account to insist that his policy would not change despite the market reaction, and called on Powell to act.
“This would be a PERFECT time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut Interest Rates,” he wrote. “He is always ‘late, ,but he could now change his image, and quickly.”"

The number of deals involving non-local homebuyers in Hong Kong has more than tripled over the past two years, official data shows, a jump that experts have attributed in part to the government’s scrapping of property market cooling measures.
But the number of transactions by local buyers increased by only 14 per cent between 2023-24 and 2024-25, with the latest level down by 34 per cent over the figure for 2020-21, when the Covid-19 pandemic started to hit the city.
The shifting make-up of homebuyers was spelled out in figures the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau provided to the Legislative Council’s Finance Committee on Thursday.
Non-locals took part in 2,997 residential property deals in 2024-25, involving HK$31.3 billion (US$4.02 billion) in total. They took part in 700 deals in 2023-24, with HK$6.78 billion in property changing hands. In 2020-21, buyers from outside the city were involved in just 110 residential property deals.
The bureau defines non-local buyers as those without any form of Hong Kong identity card and 2024-25 runs up until February 28.
The treasury’s figures also showed that the number of deals by Hongkongers in the past financial year rose to 48,458 from 42,475 in 2023-24, which was still far behind the 72,909 transactions recorded in 2020-21."

China reacted to tariffs imposed during Donald Trump’s first term in office with a strategy of phased concessions, but this time round it has adopted an unyielding stance with a massive package of retaliatory measures.
Observers said the shift stemmed from changes in the trade dynamics between the two countries and the upending of the global landscape by Trump’s agenda.
The Chinese authorities fired off a blitz of policy announcements – notably 34 per cent tariffs on all imported American goods to match the latest US levies on Chinese goods – on Friday, a public holiday known as the Ching Ming or tomb-sweeping festival.
China’s decision to hit back swiftly – rather than seek immediate negotiations – may signal a shift in strategy, said John Gong, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.
“Beijing likely sees little room for meaningful talks or suspects Washington has no real interest in negotiating,” Gong said.
“It’s also notable that China is the first among the affected countries to strike back, which could mark an escalation in the tariff war.”"

British police on Friday charged comedian Russell Brand with rape and sexual assault after an investigation sparked by complaints from several women.
London’s Metropolitan Police force said Brand, 50, faces one count of rape, one of indecent assault, one of oral rape and two of sexual assault.
The alleged offences involve four women and took place between 1999 and 2005 in central London and the English seaside town of Bournemouth.
Police said the investigation remains open and urged anyone with relevant information to contact the force.
In September 2023, British media outlets Channel 4 and the Sunday Times published claims by four women of being sexually assaulted or raped by Brand. The accusers have not been identified.
The comedian, author and Get Him To The Greek actor has denied the allegations, saying his relationships were “always consensual”.

Tim Wu, a 70-something retiree from New Taipei City, believes that Taiwan’s growing civil defence focus is counterproductive as the mainland grows ever stronger.
“It will make them angry and lead to something very bad, an attack,” Wu, whose family has lived in Taiwan for three centuries, said of mainland Chinese forces. “We absolutely can unify, and I support it.”
Taipei restaurant worker Meg Chiu, 29, considers civilian preparedness essential – but wants companies and civic groups to lead, not the government.
“I’m worried about an incursion. I think I’ll see it in my lifetime,” she said, adding with a nervous laugh: “But hopefully when I’m 70 or 80 years old.”
Beijing sees Taiwan as part of China, to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the US, do not recognise self-governing Taiwan as an independent state. But Washington opposes any attempt to take the island militarily.
Still, US President Donald Trump’s mercurial foreign policy and Russia’s 2022 attack on Ukraine have unnerved Taiwan, deepening concern among its 23 million residents that they may need to defend themselves should Beijing accelerate any military timetable.

US stock futures tumbled as much as 4.1 per cent on Friday, as strong labour data did little to mitigate the anxiety about the impact of a trade war on domestic economy.
Contracts on the S&P 500 Index plunged and Nasdaq 100 Index futures sank as much as 4.6 per cent as China imposed a 34 per cent tariff on all American imports starting April 10, in addition to targeted actions against poultry producers and weapons makers, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.
Technology megacaps including Nvidia, Tesla and Apple fell premarket. US-listed Chinese stocks like Alibaba and Baidu also slumped. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF fell as much as 1 per cent, with Morgan Stanley leading the declines.
The latest salvo in Donald Trump’s trade war added to volatility that’s been gripping global financial markets since the president announced the harshest tariffs in a century. The Cboe Volatility Index soared above 40 – levels associated with some of the worst market turbulence in recent memory. Treasuries continued to soar as investors sought safety, while a measure of credit risk spiked to the highest level since the regional banking crisis in March 2023.
US job growth beat forecasts in March and the unemployment rate edged up, pointing to a healthy labour market before the economy gets hit by widespread tariffs. This was the first major piece of data for the quarter – which could have wide-ranging implications for bond, stock and currency markets as well as the Fed’s next moves. Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver remarks at 11.25am in Arlington, Virginia, which will be parsed for signs of weakness spreading to the workforce.
“A good jobs report won’t be enough to quell recession fears because it’s backward-looking and won’t full give insight into how hard the economy will take a hit from the trade war,” Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments said over the phone."

Hong Kong cycling head coach Herve Dagorne said it would be a “tough job” but the team aimed to replicate their medal haul at the National Games from four years ago when the city co-hosts the next edition in November.
They will have a dress rehearsal at the city’s velodrome from April 19 to 21 during the Hong Kong International Track Cup, which will double as a test event for the Games and is expected to attract more than 150 riders from around the world.
Dagorne, who took over at the start of last year, admitted the team would have few excuses on their home track.
“We’re targeting four [medals] … this is a very high expectation for me,” he said. “We need to be good in every field of performance to be able to achieve this.
“The Games is very important for some provinces, and for some mainland athletes it’s even more important than the Olympic Games.
“The level is very high, even higher than the Asian Games, but we are working on it. If we achieve all the different fields of performance – the technique, the strategy – I’m confident about the physical side of our athletes.”"

This has unleashed a profound shock wave across the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). For the regional bloc, these tariffs transcend mere economic concern; they constitute an existential threat that could destabilise entire societies and ignite sociopolitical volatility. This necessitates an urgent recalibration of regional strategies and a critical reassessment of partnerships, notably with China.
The rationale underpinning reciprocal tariffs – a simplistic equation that matches tariffs to perceived trade imbalances – fundamentally ignores the intricate realities of modern production. Asean members are integral components of a complex global network, contributing substantial value to finished products. To penalise them for this role is to undermine the very foundations of international commerce.
Vietnam’s electronics exports – an estimated 34 per cent of its total exports in 2024 – are particularly imperilled. A significant portion of these exports are destined for the US market. A 46 per cent tariff could precipitate billions of dollars in lost revenue, directly affecting the livelihoods of millions employed in this vital sector.
Cambodia’s garment industry represents up to 70 per cent of its total exports and employs hundreds of thousands of workers. In 2024, Cambodia’s exports of garments, textiles, footwear and travel goods almost reached US$14 billion, a 23 per cent increase from the previous year, with garments alone accounting for US$9.79 billion, a 24 per cent year-on-year rise.
Since the US is a major export market for Cambodia, the 49 per cent tariff is likely to devastate these sectors, potentially triggering widespread unemployment."

A label scheme to identify legitimate tobacco products in Hong Kong will be fully implemented by June 2027, authorities have revealed.
Responding to an inquiry by lawmaker Edmund Wong Chun-sek, Commissioner of Customs and Excise Chan Tsz-tat said his department would invite tobacco companies to join a pilot scheme later this year.
“Having considered the relevant factors, we suggest that the system should be implemented in phases, with the first phase expected to be launched in the fourth quarter of 2026 at the earliest, and the full implementation is targeted for the second quarter of 2027,” Chan said in a written reply.
The customs chief had earlier announced plans to introduce laser labels on taxed tobacco products in a bid to tackle black market cigarettes.
In his written reply, Chan said the scheme’s exact launch date would depend on how much time was needed to amend the relevant laws, the complexity of the new regulations, the type of labelling system introduced, the industry’s readiness and the use of a grace period for accumulated stock.
The department confiscated HK$2.7 billion (US$347 million) worth of illicit cigarettes in more than 20,000 cases last year."

Indonesia’s decision to force coal exporters to adopt a government-set benchmark price has rattled Chinese firms – its biggest customers – and triggered warnings that the move could erode Jakarta’s edge in the global market.
The regulation went into effect in March, after Indonesian Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia announced that coal exporters would need to start using the government’s benchmark price, known as Harga Batubara Acuan (HBA).
Bahlil said using the HBA would ensure that Indonesian coal was not sold internationally at prices below the local benchmark, as independent pricing agencies had significantly reduced their rates compared to Indonesia’s benchmark.
Historically, the government used the HBA to determine royalty fees for coal miners, while the Indonesia Coal Index was used in pricing transactions. The new policy would mean that international sales would need to align with the HBA.
The Indonesian Energy, Mineral, and Coal Suppliers Association (Aspebindo) welcomed the move, with its deputy chairman Fathul Nugroho saying that adopting the HBA price would give Indonesia greater control over its coal pricing in the global market.
“Using HBA will better reflect rising mining costs, including increasing stripping ratios, land acquisition expenses, and fuel prices,” Fathul said when the regulation was announced at the end of February."

“The survey results reveal a complex picture of concern, caution, and strategic hesitation among companies operating in Singapore,” the report, released on Wednesday, stated.
“While most respondents are already grappling with rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory complexity, uncertainty remains high. The nearly even split between companies anticipating operational impacts and those unsure or expecting no change underscores the lack of consensus on the long-term implications of these tariffs.”

World leaders react to Trump’s new tariff blitz as global trade war escalates
While US President Donald Trump announced tariffs on allies and foes including Europe, India, Japan and China, some of the world’s most heavily sanctioned countries – Russia, Belarus, Cuba and North Korea – avoided being singled out for special punitive treatment.
With the world gripped by trade war, Trump imposed a 10 per cent tariff on most goods imported to the United States. China, the biggest supplier of goods to the US, now faces a 54 per cent tariff on all exports to the world’s biggest consumer.
“In the face of unrelenting economic warfare, the United States can no longer continue with a policy of unilateral economic surrender,” Trump said as he presented the tariffs.
The White House released a list of comments from people praising his tariffs. They said ordinary American workers would benefit after years of what they described as abuse from trading partners such as China.
Trump said he would impose a 10 per cent baseline tariff on all imports to the United States and higher duties on dozens of countries. Russia, Cuba and North Korea did not appear on the list of countries facing higher “reciprocal” tariffs released by the White House.
US intelligence agencies said in their annual threat assessment that China, Russia, Iran and North Korea were the biggest potential nation-state threats to the United States and Trump had threatened Moscow with new trade measures."

A “thrill-seeking” American man has been arrested for sneaking onto a forbidden Indian Ocean island that is home to the world’s most isolated tribe, sparking fears of social media influencers posing a new threat to its indigenous people.
According to Indian police, Mykhailo Viktorovych Polyakov landed on North Sentinel Island to try to make contact with and film the isolated Sentinelese tribe on Friday last week, The Times of India reported. He brought offerings of a can of coke and a coconut.
Polyakov, 24, had arrived at Port Blair in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands on March 26 and checked into a resort near Khurmadera Beach a day later. He left a note with the hotel staff saying he was going to visit a nearby island and would be late.
However, instead of Baratang Island, a “probe revealed that he had actually visited the restricted North Sentinel Island, entering the prohibited tribal reserve area”, a senior police officer told the Indian newspaper.
Indian police arrested Polyakov on Monday and seized his GoPro camera. During interrogation, he claimed that he was a “thrill seeker” who had previously visited Taliban-controlled Afghanistan."

China’s world No 8 Zheng Qinwen has joined a call for more money from the grand slams to filter down to the lower ranks.
“I think that’s going to benefit all the players, not only the top players, especially those that work hard during the year and need to get paid from the grand slams and have to survive,” she said.
Zheng said tennis should follow the example of the NBA, where players earn in aggregate around 50 per cent of basketball-related income.
“That’s really positive, because if you look at basketball, they all get paid 50-50. The players, we’re working really hard – because I’m a tennis player I know how much I’ve worked to arrive here,” the Olympic champion added.
Zheng said she was unsure if the grand slams would listen to the demands of the players.
“We try to do what we can, and then let’s see what the gods brings to us. But at least we’re trying.”"

If you are in Hong Kong this long weekend, then there are a few things you might want to check out, including an Oscar-winning animated film, a full-length ballet on Mexican painter Frida Kahlo and a craft beer event.
When director Gints Zilbalodis accepted his Oscar win for best animated feature last month for his ethereal animated film Flow, he thanked his parents and his “cats and dogs” – fitting, given that the charming cartoon follows a feline and other animals as they survive a huge flood.
Then he added a rallying cry for the industry: “I’m really moved by the warm reception our film has had … and I hope that it will open doors to independent animation filmmakers around the world.”
Made in Latvia for US$3.7 million (HK$28.8 million), Flow has grossed over 10 times that in ticket sales to date. Perhaps it helps that the dialogue-free fable transcends language barriers, but it is almost impossible to imagine Pixar or DreamWorks creating something this mystical.
Flow is in cinemas now."

Hong Kong police have apprehended seven, including a teenage boy who took intimate pictures of his younger sister, in an international crackdown on child pornography that saw more than 400 arrests across six jurisdictions in East and Southeast Asia.
Bonnie Ngan Hoi-ian, chief inspector of the force’s cybersecurity and technology crime bureau, said intelligence exchange between Hong Kong police and its counterparts in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Japan and South Korea led to the arrest of 435 suspects, aged 13 to 68, in these six locations between February 24 and March 28.
“All the [arrests] are individual cases. We don’t see connections between the criminals, but syndicates trying to profit from child pornography is one of the most important things we are looking into,” Ngan said.
The chief inspector added that the force had conducted cyberpatrols to investigate whether there were local syndicates producing and distributing child pornography.
Among the arrests were seven Hong Kong men, aged between 16 and 49. They were charged with production and possession of child pornography, as well as obstructing police in carrying out their duties. They were among the 435 people arrested.
The 16-year-old boy arrested in the operation was found to have eight photos of his younger sister on his mobile phone."

A red-hot favourite to become the city’s first winner of the Group One Dubai Turf (1,800m), Romantic Warrior can secure a Hong Kong record 11th elite-level success in the US$5 million (HK$39 million) contest, breaking his deadlock with the great Golden Sixty.
Victory for Hong Kong’s most decorated galloper would see him snare a fourth Group One triumph abroad and add around HK$22.5 million to his current world record HK$206,931,497 in career stakes.
Ready to turn up the heat on Danny Shum Chap-shing’s Romantic Warrior are not only reigning Dubai Turf champion Facteur Cheval, Godolphin’s Nations Pride and star Japanese pair Soul Rush and Liberty Island, but also the scorching Dubai weather, with Saturday’s meeting delayed an hour due to high temperatures.
“Obviously he copes with [the heat] pretty well, so that’s no concern,” said jockey James McDonald.
“He certainly enjoys the firm surface we’re likely to get on the hot day and he copes with everything pretty well. He’s got round this track beautifully,” added McDonald in reference to Romantic Warrior’s Group One Jebel Hatta (1,800m) victory in track-record time at Meydan in January.
Since that Jebel Hatta blitz, Romantic Warrior produced one of the biggest efforts of his career when a heartbreaking second in the Group One Saudi Cup (1,800m) on the dirt – something connections are confident he’s fully recovered from.
“It’s like he knows when the race is coming up – he’s really sparked up since James jumped on his back for his turf gallop on Tuesday,” said equine physiotherapist Tom Simpson, who has worked with Romantic Warrior for much of his remarkable journey.
Elsewhere on Dubai World Cup night, John Size will chase his first winner overseas at his 14th attempt when Howdeepisyourlove lines up in the Group One Al Quoz Sprint (1,200m) down the Meydan straight.
Also to be ridden by McDonald, Howdeepisyourlove is a $3.2 favourite in fixed-odds markets and will look to join Joy And Fun (2010), Amber Sky (2014) and California Spangle (2024) as Hong Kong-trained winners of the race.
“I would love to win a race overseas. We just keep trying,” said 12-time Hong Kong champion trainer Size.
Rounding out Hong Kong’s Meydan assault is the Frankie Lor Fu-chuen-trained Sword Point, who tackles the Group Two Godolphin Mile on the dirt.
Like Size, Lor is hoping to taste success overseas for the first time and he is confident his all-weather specialist is ready to produce his best on the world stage.
“It’s a great sign that he hasn’t turned a hair since arriving even though this is his first time travelling to race overseas,” said Lor of Sword Point, who also has the services of star Kiwi McDonald.
“Some horses might be scared and some horses don’t eat up well but he’s doing well in every aspect.
“If he wins, it would be the best result. I think for every trainer sending a horse to race overseas, they would want to win, doing Hong Kong proud.”
Elsewhere on a bumper World Cup card, the horse who humbled Romantic Warrior in the Saudi Cup – Forever Young – is a short favourite for the US$12 million Group One Dubai World Cup (2,000m) on dirt, while the Group One Dubai Sheema Classic (2,410m) is brimming with stars.
Reigning Group One Champions & Chater Cup (2,400m) victor Rebel’s Romance is among the leading hopes, but he is sure to face stiff competition from December’s Group One Hong Kong Vase (2,400m) champion Giavellotto and the likes of Calandagan, Shin Emperor and Danon Decile.
The Jockey Club will simulcast seven races from Meydan on Saturday night, while during the day six races will be offered for betting from Randwick in Sydney, where Hong Kong-based jockeys Zac Purton, Hugh Bowman and Andrea Atzeni will chase Group One glory."

Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law Shuk-pui made the pledge on Friday after presenting her work and plans to Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, and meeting other officials in Beijing.
“Director Xia is especially concerned about how we can keep putting forth new ideas to enhance our tourism offerings, especially our islands and coasts. We can make the most of this kind of precious and rich tourism resource,” she said.
“In fact, we have been keeping up with our short, medium and long-term plans … We’ll be working step-by-step to carry out the vision instructed by the central government. We need to roll out new things to keep attracting tourists to return to Hong Kong.”

Every time I open the container in which I keep most of my dried spices, the scent of cloves is overwhelming. I have a long, multistrand “necklace” of them, given to me a few years ago at a shop in Istanbul, Turkey, where my husband and I had made a purchase.
As much as I cook, I’ll never make it through the entire necklace, because cloves are powerfully strong and aromatic, despite their small size.
Cloves are the immature flower bud of a tree in the myrtle family. They’re used, whole or ground, in sweet and savoury dishes, to which they add a warm, intense flavour; if you bite into one, though, they numb the tongue.
They’re also used in cigarettes, essential oils and holistic medicine, where they’re said to work as an antioxidant and antiseptic, help relieve toothache, stimulate the senses and alleviate tension."

Asian shares slid further on Friday after President Donald Trump’s tariffs sent shudders through financial markets at a level of shock unseen since the Covid-19 pandemic pummelled global markets in 2020.
Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 sank 4.3 per cent, while South Korea’s Kospi Index tumbled 1.8 per cent. The two US allies said they were focused on negotiating lower tariffs with Trump’s administration. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped 2.2 per cent.
Markets in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Indonesia were closed for public holidays, limiting the scope of Friday’s sell-off.
In other trading on Friday, the dollar weakened to 145.39 Japanese yen from 146.06. The yen is often used as a refuge in uncertain times, while Trump’s policies are meant in part to weaken the US currency to make goods made in the US more competitive in overseas markets. The euro strengthened to US$1.1095 from US$1.1055.

The facility is the last of the eight measures unveiled more than two years ago to be implemented by the government, forming a part of a comprehensive ecosystem for family offices to set up in Hong Kong, Fong said.
“Many wealthy families have collected art to establish their family legacy,” Fong said in an exclusive interview with the Post. “This will allow them to store their collection in a secure and temperature-controlled facility.”
Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) in January unveiled a blueprint for an airport city called Skytopia, which included a stand-alone art-storage facility and other related infrastructure, the city’s largest marina with 500 berths, hotels, fresh food markets and an indoor performance venue for 20,000 spectators.

Elderly couples are divorcing at alarming rates in Malaysia as phone and social media addiction drives a wedge in communication and intimacy among them, according to a counsellor who has handled such cases.
Independent counsellor Hushim Salleh told This Week in Asia that half of all senior couples – mostly from the country’s richest state of Selangor where Hushim is based – who had sought counselling with him ended up in divorce over the past three years.
Wives routinely complained of the lack of interaction as their husbands were busy doomscrolling through their smartphones for most of the day, he said.
“I can say 90 per cent of the time it is the wife who will ask for a divorce. Their husbands will just sit on the side and play with their phones, but imagine in one day there are 24 hours. What do you think your wife feels? Lonely,” Hushim told This Week in Asia.
Hushim, a 35-year veteran in the field, said social media addiction was a key complaint raised during counselling sessions at his practice in Selangor over the past three years, where he typically handled between three and five cases of marital breakdown among elderly couples a month.
There are over 28 million unique social media accounts in Malaysia, accounting for about 82 per cent of the country’s population of 34 million, according to a 2024 study by online intelligence firm Meltwater and US-based creative agency We Are Social."

According to a calculation by the Post, the Philippine National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) has announced the detention of 18 Chinese nationals charged with espionage in four cases this year.
That included a case on March 19 when six Chinese citizens were arrested for allegedly monitoring US Navy movements in the highly strategic Subic Bay, which is some 200km (124 miles) from the disputed Scarborough Shoal and was the home of a major US military base until 1992.

Huawei Technologies has applied for a patent in “ternary logic”, an alternative to binary computing logic first explored in the former Soviet Union, in hopes that it could improve the design of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and help mitigate the impact of US sanctions
According to a notice published by the China National Intellectual Property Administration last month, Huawei applied for the patent in ternary logic in the design of integrated circuits in September 2023, but the application was only made public last month.
It remains unknown why the patent application, which was attributed to five Huawei scientists led by Hu Hailin and Huang Mingqiang, was only made public two years after its application date.
The approach could be used to reduce the number of transistors on a chip and therefore reduce energy consumption, according to the patent application, which comes at a time when advanced chip designs at the 2-nanometre level are approaching physical limits.
It is not clear whether the ternary logic chip, which uses a -1, 0 and 1 numerical system instead of the binary 0 and 1 approach used in computing, can be produced on a viable, commercial scale. The first ternary computer was built in 1958 at Moscow State University, but ternary standards have lost significance as binary computers dominated the world."

The research, published in the journal Nature, is part of growing understanding about how many factors influence brain health as we age – and what we can do about it.

Hong Kong authorities should use the revenue garnered from the coming legalisation of basketball betting to set up a fund for sports development, a think tank has suggested, while an NGO has proposed using some of the money to boost counselling services for gambling addicts.
Our Hong Kong Foundation, the city’s largest think tank, on Friday urged the government to inject revenue from basketball gambling into a new fund for improving community sports facilities, training professional athletes and hosting international tournaments.
“We should utilise the additional profits to give back to society, especially in terms of public investment,” Josselyn Chau, the foundation’s research manager, said.
She suggested that 40 per cent of the revenue could go towards renovating community sports venues and 30 per cent to hiring international coaches who could offer better training for athletes.
The remaining 30 per cent could be used to explore more opportunities to host international games in Hong Kong, Chau said.
Her suggestion followed the launch of a public consultation on the legalisation of basketball betting by the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau on Wednesday, which said it would adopt “a pragmatic approach” by allowing a limited number of authorised gambling outlets."

Championship leader Lando Norris topped the times for McLaren in first practice for the Japanese Grand Prix on Friday as Yuki Tsunoda impressed on his Red Bull debut with the sixth-fastest lap at the Suzuka circuit.
Norris twice had to abandon his flying lap and went off the track into the gravel at the final chicane on his 12th, but came out of the pits after a switch from medium to soft tyres to set a time of one minute, 28.549 seconds.
Mercedes driver George Russell had been the front runner for much of the session on a sunny day at Suzuka but had to settle for second place ahead of the Ferrari duo of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton in third and fourth.
All eyes were on Japan’s Tsunoda, however, as he enjoyed his first session in the Red Bull after being promoted from the Racing Bulls team at the expense of Liam Lawson last week.
The 24-year-old took little time getting used to his new car and was standing in second place after his quickest lap before being overhauled by the leading quartet and his teammate Max Verstappen later in the session.
Crucially, though, Tsunoda was only a tenth of a second behind the four-time world champion, a marked improvement on the pace managed by New Zealander Lawson in the first two races of the season in Australia and China."

At least six White House National Security Council officials have been fired or reassigned, according to several people familiar with the matter, in what appeared to be the first significant purge of Donald Trump’s second presidency.
It was not clear exactly why the officials were let go. But three of the sources said several were told there were issues with their background vetting.
One of the sources said there were also concerns about leaks to the media, while two other sources suggested the ouster was aimed broadly at officials who held views that were seen as too interventionist for the liking of Trump’s allies.
On Wednesday, Trump met with right-wing conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, who privately called on the president to fire some NSC staffers. The New York Times was the first to report their meeting, while Axios first reported on the NSC purge on Thursday."

An earlier version of this story incorrectly quoted Anand Sivaraman as saying that there are only about 750,000 doctors who are trained retina specialists for the country’s 1.4-billion population who can diagnose and treat the condition at an early stage. This has been corrected.
India is turning to artificial intelligence in a bid to curb the silent spread of glaucoma, a degenerative eye disease that threatens to blind millions amid acute shortages of trained specialists and uneven access to care across the country.
About 12 million people in India are thought to have glaucoma, according to various estimates, with about 1.2 million suffering from blindness related to the disease, accounting for 5.5 per cent of all blindness cases nationwide.
The disease damages the optic nerve, often without noticeable symptoms, leading to loss of vision if left untreated. The condition’s asymptomatic nature makes early detection challenging, as patients often assume their vision is normal even as nerve damage is already taking place.
“The disease is becoming a menace because a lot of cases are probably going undetected,” said Anand Sivaraman, founding director of Remidio, a company developing AI-driven glaucoma detection systems.
People across South and Southeast Asia are more vulnerable to the condition because generally they have smaller eyes than Caucasians, which can affect fluid damage that gradually leads to the condition, according to Sivaraman.
Asia is expected to see a significant rise in glaucoma cases, with an estimated 27.8 million additional cases by 2040, studies have shown. According to the World Health Organization, glaucoma is the most common cause of irreversible blindness across the globe."

On March 1, Beijing officially announced the construction of a deep-sea habitat in these methane-rich “cold seep” zones, where six researchers will live for month-long stretches to study gas hydrates – crystalline formations of methane trapped in ice.
With 80 billion tonnes of oil-equivalent reserves – far surpassing the Gulf’s 50 billion-tonne proven oil stocks – these vast hydrate deposits could redefine energy geopolitics.
In that way, the deep sea space station is not merely about energy. “It’s about guarding the oceans,” said Professor Wang Shuhong, a leading marine geologist, in a lecture posted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) on social media last month."

The two have met twice previously at flyweight with the Thai fighter winning on both occasions – the second of which was in 2020.

In the past, depreciation was largely driven by a wide interest rate differential between the US dollar and the yuan, which prompted investors to favour dollar-denominated assets, said Miao Yanliang, the deputy head of the research department at the bank that is often dubbed “China’s Goldman Sachs”.
That pressure was unlikely to persist, Miao said in an interview, adding that he remained positive China can withstand the change after the latest US tariff announcement.
“The Fed has been cutting rates, and it’s going to cut further,” said Miao, adding that renewed investor interest could support capital inflows and help stabilise the yuan. “Global investors are coming back with hedge funds coming back first, and then next is going to be regional money [from] the Asian region.”
He added that onshore and offshore markets were needed if the yuan was to be used to settle trade and store value for investors."

Intel shares gained on a report that the company tentatively agreed to a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co joint venture, a sign the beleaguered US chipmaker is moving ahead with a plan that has been highly anticipated by investors.
The shares climbed more than 2 per cent on Thursday after The Information website reported the news, erasing a decline of more than 5 per cent earlier in the session. The stock had been up about 10 per cent this year through Wednesday, fuelled in part by hopes that Intel would pursue such a move.
Executives from both companies reached a preliminary agreement to form a joint venture that would run Intel’s manufacturing plants, The Information reported. Intel and other American chipmakers will hold the majority of stock in the initiative, which would include at least some of the US company’s factories, said the news site, which cited unnamed people familiar with the situation.
Bloomberg News reported in February that the companies were discussing the idea at the request of the Trump administration. The scenario is meant to help address Intel’s deteriorating financial state, which has forced the company to cut thousands of jobs and curb its expansion plans.
A representative for Santa Clara, California-based Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while TSMC declined to comment.
If the plan goes forward, it would be a dramatic early step for Intel Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan, who just took the job last month. During an appearance at the Intel Vision conference in Las Vegas on Monday, he said the chipmaker would spin off assets that are not central to its mission.
As part of the joint venture negotiations, TSMC has discussed sharing some of its manufacturing techniques with Intel in exchange for a 20 per cent stake in the new company, The Information said. But some Intel executives are concerned that the deal would lead to lay-offs and sideline its existing chipmaking technology, the website said."

“The defendant’s violations of the law had severe consequences for the constitutional order,” acting chief justice Moon Hyung-bae said. “The benefits of defending the constitution by dismissing the president overwhelmingly outweigh the national cost of his removal.”
Yoon, who did not attend the hearing, apologised on Friday and said it was “a great honour” to serve the country.
“I am deeply regretful and sorry for not being able to meet your expectations. I will always pray for our beloved country and its people,” he said in a statement.

The Taiwan Relations Act was signed by then-president Jimmy Carter shortly after Washington switched official diplomatic relations from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, and obligates the US government to support Taiwan’s defence capabilities.
However, it does not specifically articulate a one-China policy, which is spelled out in the first of the communiques – agreements between the US and China that formalised the diplomatic switch.

A powerful explosion has killed at least five people, including a pregnant woman and one-year-old baby, during a stand-off between rival groups of gold miners in northwestern Bolivia, police said, a rare instance of territorial disputes between the nation’s mining co-operatives turning fatal.
The blast thundered through the Yani mining camp on Thursday as two rival mining groups disputed access to the gold mine near the mountain town of Sorata, some 150km (about 90 miles) northwest of the country’s administrative capital of La Paz, said Colonel Gunther Agudo, a local police officer. Several gold deposits straddle the remote area.
Agudo had initially reported six people killed but revised the toll to five after firefighters finished recovering the bodies from under the rubble. The dead included three men, a pregnant woman and an infant, he said.

Hoang Cuong started buying shares five years ago in the hope that he could one day afford to buy a flat in Hanoi.
“I am in shock,” said Cuong with deep sighs, speaking from his downtown district workplace. With returns on his investments all but wiped out, the 36-year-old is planning to cash out whatever little he can get. “I am not sure what will be next, whether the situation will get worse – the market might drop even more.”
The Communist country of 101 million people has thrived in the 40 years since the Doi Moi reforms, as it turned itself into a maker of everything from Gap clothes to Samsung smartphones. Now it is facing a 46 per cent tax on exports and is one of the most striking victims of Trump’s second take-no-prisoners trade war.
“In Vietnamese we call it a ‘cutthroat rate’ which will basically destroy our businesses,” said Le Dang Doanh, an economist and former government adviser in Hanoi. “We can’t rely on the US market any more,” Doanh added."

China said on Thursday that it had detained three Philippine nationals on suspicion of spying a week after five Chinese people were arrested by Manila on espionage charges.
It is unusual for China to give details of countries suspected of spying, but on Thursday state news broadcaster CCTV published images of the three being questioned by police along with their names.
State news agency Xinhua identified the three as David Servañez, Albert Endencia and Nathalie Plizardo, and said they had been recruited by a spy master named Richie Herrera – whose whereabouts are not known.
The authorities said the suspects had pretended to be fishermen transporting bait while flying hi-tech drones to monitor the vessels.
That same month, Philippine security forces had also arrested a Chinese national and two Filipino associates for allegedly mapping more than 120 key sites on Luzon, including ports and military bases."

The levy is in addition to the existing 20 per cent tariff imposed by President Donald Trump shortly after he took office in January, bringing it close to the 60 per cent rate he threatened during the election campaign and almost falling into the worst-case scenario projected by global investment banks.
The Trump administration also plugged a gap by imposing tariffs ranging from 24 per cent to 46 per cent on Southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam and Thailand, to prevent Chinese goods from being diverted to the US.
“This will have a ripple effect on macro consumption, which is still weak but saw pockets of stabilisation recently,” said Kai Wang, a market strategist at Morningstar. “This could have long-term ramifications, and it is possible China might announce more fiscal stimulus to counteract perceived macro weakness.”

It’s hard to defend the Tottenham boss after such a difficult season domestically which shows no signs of improving.
A win at Stamford Bridge would have been a huge positive marker. Alas …
Enzo Maresca’s Chelsea received a huge boost to their ambitions of qualifying for the Uefa Champions League with a 1-0 victory over Tottenham.
Enzo Fernandez scored the game’s only legitimate goal of the game on 50 minutes before both sides had strikes ruled out by VAR.
Postecoglou was seen cupping his ear to the away fans after Pape Sarr thought he had equalised for the visitors and suggested afterwards he just “wanted them to get really excited. I felt at that point we could potentially go on and win the game”.
The result leaves Spurs 14th with their domestic campaign petering out and the Uefa Europa League remaining as potential salvation to their dreadful season.
For Chelsea, this is their third win in four matches but their first against a side not in the relegation zone for two months.
Victory moved them back into fourth, above Manchester City and two points clear of sixth-place Newcastle United in what is increasingly a tense battle for Champions League qualification."

Rights groups have called for greater transparency and an end to prolonged and opaque detentions of foreigners under investigation by local immigration authorities.
Nagoya’s immigration agency has confirmed it possesses around 295 hours of video footage of Sandamali while she was in detention for overstaying her visa. However, the agency has only agreed to release five hours of recordings to her family.
Sandamali’s family has already filed a suit demanding compensation from the Japanese government for her death, claiming that she died because immigration authorities failed to provide her with medical care when she became unwell.
The government has defended the actions of the officials at the detention centre and claimed that medical examinations found no reasons for Sandamali’s poor health. Her family believes the footage that has been being withheld may shed light on the circumstances leading to her death.
A segment of the footage that has been provided to the family shows her falling to the floor from her bunk and pleading with two staff for help, the family’s Japanese lawyers have said."

World leaders react to Trump’s new tariff blitz as global trade war escalates
New Civil Liberties Alliance, a conservative legal group, on Thursday filed what it said was the first lawsuit seeking to block Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports, saying the US president overstepped his authority.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Florida, alleges that Trump lacked the legal authority to impose the sweeping tariffs unveiled on Wednesday as well as duties authorised on February 1 under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.
“By invoking emergency power to impose an across-the-board tariff on imports from China that the statute does not authorise, President Trump has misused that power, usurped Congress’s right to control tariffs, and upset the Constitution’s separation of powers,” NCLA senior litigation counsel Andrew Morris said in a statement.
White House representatives did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
NCLA filed the lawsuit on behalf of Simplified, a Florida-based retailer of home management products."

Chinese drug makers landed 33 deals with overseas healthcare firms in the first three months of this year, with transactions totalling US$36.2 billion, according to a report published on Wednesday by mainland pharmaceutical and biotech consultancy DrugTimes.
That was up from the first quarter last year, when Chinese biotech firms made 28 overseas deals, according to the report. There were 98 transactions recorded in 2024, with a total value of US$59.5 billion.
The largest deal in the first quarter, with a contract value of US$13 billion, was between GeneQuantum – headquartered in Suzhou, a city in eastern Jiangsu province – and Nasdaq-listed Biohaven as well as Seoul-based pharmaceutical firm AimedBio. It involved antibody drug conjugates, which are a class of drugs designed as a targeted therapy for treating cancer.
In one of the deals last quarter, Hong Kong-listed biotech firm Harbour BioMed entered into a strategic global collaboration with AstraZeneca to develop next-generation, multi-specific antibodies for immunology and oncology. The deal was valued at US$4.7 billion, according to DrugTimes.
The steady rise of these deals, including out-licensing and joint ventures, reflects how the Chinese pharmaceutical sector is expanding offshore."

Clutching a “Reciprocal Tariffs” board at his side, US President Donald Trump upgraded his powerful trade storm in the global supply chain to a category that few in its path have ever felt.
Fernando Ching Lau, a Los Angeles supermarket owner, says Trump’s immigration crackdown had already hurt his business – with fearful families avoiding stores. And now, with tariff hikes hitting broad swathes of the planet, the cost is about to grow.
“The tariff policies will hit me even harder – sourcing locations, order volumes, and procurement costs are all becoming far less predictable,” Lau said.
According to Lau, the cost per container – including goods and logistics – currently runs between US$30,000 to US$50,000. By summer, he believes, it could rise by 50 per cent.
Lau originally planned to shift some purchasing from China to Vietnam, Turkey and Mexico. But now, with the US imposing tariffs on those countries as well, he said he intends to pause or slow down the transition."

This is the latest instalment in our From the Vault feature series, in which we reflect on culturally significant movies celebrating notable anniversaries.
At the turn of the millennium, the rise of digital technology allowed filmmakers to do almost anything they wanted. The limits were their imaginations – and the audience’s patience.
The 2005 film Sin City, which turns 20 this month, was adapted from Frank Miller’s neo-noir comic book series and directed by Robert Rodriguez (Desperado) and Miller himself. Along with the 2004 films Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, which starred Jude Law, and the Japanese superhero flick Casshern, it was one of a clutch of movies shot completely on a “digital backlot”.
This means that everything except the actors, props and basic sets was created digitally, allowing the filmmakers to closely copy the highly stylised source material. Indeed, Rodriguez called it “less of an adaptation than a translation”.
Intrigued by the technology, Quentin Tarantino directed one sequence for the nominal fee of one US dollar. In fact, he was returning a favour, as Rodriguez had scored Kill Bill: Volume 2 for the same amount."

China is mastering directed energy, radio frequency and other advanced weapon systems that threaten US activities in space, the head of operations for the US Space Force warned on Thursday.
General B. Chance Saltzman, the force’s chief of space operations, told the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission that China has used its resources more effectively than the US because Beijing is more narrowly focused on one region on the planet, while Washington must manage a larger agenda.
“We just have a much broader set of missions than what we see the PRC focusing on,” he told the commission. “They’re very clear in that they have a Western Pacific mindset.
“They’re able to husband their resources around all the capabilities in that area,” he said, comparing it to China’s rapidly growing maritime ambitions in the Asia-Pacific.

A Trump administration official said on Thursday the United States is in talks with conflict-plagued DR Congo on developing its mineral resources under a deal that the Congolese president has said could help make his country safer.
“You have heard about a minerals agreement. We have reviewed” Congo’s proposal, Boulos said. “I am pleased to announce that the president and I have agreed on a path forward for its development.”

Fresh dung. Tracks in the sand of the Namib desert. The black rhinoceros cannot be far away. Wildlife rangers Stefanus Ganuseb, 42, and Fritz Hoeb, 45, are patrolling on foot, equipped with binoculars and a camera, and accompanied by an armed policeman.
Then they discover the young male rhino named Arthur on a distant crest.
The rangers check the direction of the wind so that their scent will not be detected, and creep toward the animal. Normally they get no closer than 100 metres (330 feet), but today, Arthur is coming closer, not noticing the men and peacefully grazing on juicy stalks of spurge bushes.
The men take pictures and fill out a form of the sighting for the animal protection group Save the Rhino Trust.
“The chief aim of Save the Rhino Trust is to protect the black rhinoceros from poachers,” says Lesley Karutjaiva, the 47-year-old head of the group’s base in Palmwag, in northwestern Namibia. It is from the local lodge that tours start for observing the creatures."

Fitch Ratings downgraded China’s sovereign rating on concerns over weakening finances and rising public debt, just one day after the US imposed higher tariffs on the country.
The cut takes China’s long-term foreign currency default rating to “A” from “A+” with a stable outlook, Fitch said in a statement on Thursday.
China’s Ministry of Finance responded with a strong rebuke, describing the decision as biased and not reflective of reality.
The cost of insuring Chinese sovereign debt against default using credit default swaps extended a gain that had begun earlier on Thursday, jumping to the highest level in more than two months.
The downgrade, which is based on forecasts made before US President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on Wednesday, reflects expectations that China’s public finances will continue to weaken and public debt levels will continue to rise, Fitch said.
Analysts at the ratings agency added that “there is headroom at the current rating to accommodate the likely implications for economic growth and fiscal metrics” from the tariffs, which pushed US taxes on many Chinese goods well above 50 per cent."

“This reflects the wait-and-see mood in the property market before US President Trump took office in January,” said Yeung Ming-yee, a senior associate director in the research department at Centaline Property Agency. “In addition, many citizens travelled abroad during the long Lunar New Year holiday and postponed entering the market.”
Centaline had expected that 4,295 property deals would be completed in February with a total value of HK$28.24 billion.

Hong Kong developers plan to put more flats on sale in the coming weeks, hoping to catch buyers amid signs the government’s latest policy incentives are helping to revive demand.
China Vanke said it would unveil the price list for its Le Mont project in Tai Po this week, while Sun Hung Kai Properties (SHKP) is slated to sell the first units in its Yoho West Parkside development in Tin Shui Wai.
The performance came as a relief for Hong Kong’s residential market after a rebound – aided by easier mortgage terms in October – petered out. A sharp rally in Hong Kong’s US$5.9 trillion stock market has helped restore some equity wealth, helping buyers sidestep concerns about the interest-rate outlook and US-China trade tensions.
“More than 70 per cent of the [Le Mont] project consists of small and medium-sized flats, and the overall economic environment has gradually recovered,” said Quincy Chow Ming-hei, managing director at Vanke Hong Kong, a local unit of the mainland-based developer. “The property market will be steady in the future.”"

An earlier version of this story referred to US company Blackstone as BlackRock.
The final chapter of the TikTok divest-or-ban saga is set to unfold before Saturday, when the extension US President Donald Trump gave the Chinese-owned platform to secure an American buyer expires.
But with Trump apparently holding the popular short-video app as a bargaining chip for a trade negotiation with Beijing, analysts say the deadline may not matter.
Calling himself a “very flexible person” as he spoke to reporters on Monday, Trump said a potential TikTok deal or extension was not “tied” to tariffs, but that “it could be”.
“I’ve used tariffs for lots of different reasons, but I could see, you know, one point in tariffs with China, big country, would be probably worth more than all of TikTok. As valuable as TikTok is, it’s mixed up,” he said.
Based on the premise that TikTok posed a national security threat because the data it stores on its more than 170 million American users could be transmitted to Beijing, Congress last year passed – and then-President Joe Biden approved – a law that forced ByteDance either to sell the app or face its ban in the US.
After the Supreme Court upheld the law, the deadline for a sale – January 19, a day before Trump returned to power – passed and TikTok briefly shut down.
The platform resumed operations after Trump, who boasts over 15 million TikTok followers, vowed not to enforce the ban."

The two companies – Nasdaq-listed EHang Holdings and Hefei Hey Airlines – obtained air operator certificates from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) on Saturday, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.
The move means that both companies are cleared to use unmanned aerial vehicles to offer commercial passenger services, including urban sightseeing tours.
The air operator certificate was the final regulatory hurdle both companies’ passenger drones needed to clear before being put into operation, given that they had already obtained the type certificate, production certificate and airworthiness certificate, according to a report by Citic Securities.

Major Chinese developers like China Overseas Land & Investment and Country Garden Holdings continue to report disappointing earnings, as the country’s property sector remains mired in a downturn despite a range of supportive measures.
State-backed China Overseas Land & Investment’s profit for 2024 plunged 40 per cent to 15.6 billion yuan (US$2.2 billion) while its total debt dropped 6 per cent to 241.6 billion yuan, according to a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Monday. Revenue fell 9 per cent from a year earlier to 185.2 billion yuan.
The lower profit led to a reduced dividend payout of HK$0.60 (US$0.07) per share for 2024, compared with HK$0.80 a year earlier.
China’s property sector, which used to account for more than a quarter of the nation’s gross domestic product, has been troubled since authorities in late 2020 unveiled a campaign to deleverage real estate companies, which had relied on aggressive bank borrowings and debt financing to buy land and gain market share.

Huawei Technologies’ consumer business saw annual revenue surge 38 per cent in 2024, signalling the tech giant’s recovery in a segment that has been reinvigorated despite the ongoing US-China tech war.
Revenue for the consumer unit, which includes its smartphone business, surged 38 per cent year on year to 339 billion yuan (US$47 billion), contributing to a 22 per cent increase in total revenue, according to data released by the US-sanctioned company on Monday.
Huawei recorded total annual revenue of 862.1 billion yuan in 2024, its second-highest on record, signalling progress by the Shenzhen-based firm in overcoming US sanctions imposed on its mobile phone and international operations in recent years. Although Huawei is not a listed company, it discloses financial data on a regular basis.
“In 2024, the entire team at Huawei banded together to tackle a wide range of external challenges, while further improving product quality, operations quality, and operational efficiency,” Sabrina Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s rotating chairwoman, said in a statement on Monday. The performance was “in line with forecast”, she added.
The company’s information and communications technology infrastructure segment, which includes its carrier and enterprise business units, saw revenue rise 5 per cent to 369.9 billion yuan, accounting for the firm’s largest revenue stream.
Another segment that recorded strong growth was intelligent automotive solutions, which includes the commercialisation of its autonomous driving and intelligent vehicle solutions. The business saw revenue expand nearly five times to 26.4 billion yuan, while also posting an annual profit for the first time."

A surge in discount selling by cash-strapped owners has sparked something of a frenzy among well-heeled buyers, pushing demand for upscale homes up by as much as 50 per cent from last year, according to agents.
“So far in 2025, despite an overall market downturn, the market witnessed active transactions in luxury properties,” said Lucia Leung, director of research and consultancy for Greater China at Knight Frank. “This highlights a persistent appetite for high-end properties among affluent buyers, particularly as confidence in the market begins to stabilise.”
A property at 6 Stanley Beach Road sold this month for HK$116 million, 45 per cent lower than the peak price of HK$212 million in 2011, according to Victoria Allan, founder and managing director of Habitat Property.
This month, a 2,201 sq ft unit in Cluny Park in the Mid-Levels neighbourhood above Central sold for HK$57 million, 32 per cent lower than when it was last transacted in June 2016 for HK$83.9 million, Leung said.

Investors are snapping up luxury homes in Shanghai in the 30 million yuan (US$4.2 million) plus range, as they expect super expensive homes in China’s commercial and financial hub to continue to buck the overall downward trend in the real estate market, according to market observers.
But the rosy performance of this segment alone was not enough to bail out the city’s embattled property sector and the wider industry, they added.
“Frenetic buying of flats in Kerry’s new project adds to the evidence that Shanghai and its land remained attractive to cash-rich people,” said Zhu Xinhai, a sales manager with Shanghai-based 5i5j Real Estate Brokerage. “But most middle and low-income residents are still wary of the property market outlook despite strong housing demand.”

A shift is taking place in the way businesses approach the workplace, moving beyond focusing on location and office specifications to prioritising people-centric design. Enhancing employee well-being and addressing diverse needs are now of paramount importance for business leaders, as they strive to attract and retain talent, and maximise performance.
According to the Gensler Research Institute’s “Global Workplace Survey 2024”, employees in high-performing workplaces that offer spaces for relaxation, concentration and confidential conversations exhibit improved productivity, better work quality and faster decision-making.
The survey also revealed that employees in high-performing workplaces benefit from amenities and services that improve their work experience and cater to lifestyle needs. These spaces include areas that enhance social connectivity.
In the competitive landscape of Hong Kong’s office market, Swire Properties says it has successfully distinguished Taikoo Place as a premier business hub by focusing on tenant engagement and employee well-being. The developer says this approach has not only maintained high occupancy rates but also fostered a vibrant community where businesses thrive.
Taikoo Place, home to more than 35,000 office workers and 200 multinational corporations, has recently completed a HK$15 billion (US$1.9 billion) revitalisation project, adding two triple grade A office towers and 390,000 sq ft of amenities to a total area of 7 million sq ft. Together with expansive landscaped gardens, parks and new elevated air-conditioned walkways, these enhancements have created a dynamic environment that supports both productivity and relaxation.
“Our goal at Taikoo Place is to create an amenity-led portfolio where people want to work, play and stay, therefore extending the operating hours of what is predominantly a commercial district, and breathing life into the area outside normal office hours,” says Don Taylor, director, office, Swire Properties. “Before it became a world-class business hub, Taikoo Place was an industrial trading estate in what was then considered a decentralised location on Hong Kong Island. As Taikoo Place has evolved, so have the amenities and services that we offer to our tenant base. By leveraging our placemaking attributes, including amenity provision, ESG [environmental, social and governance] credentials and initiatives, as well as tenant engagement activities and biophilic design, we have successfully captured the current ‘flight-to-quality’ trend, as corporates look to upgrade their office accommodation to meet their ESG goals and enhance staff well-being."

The US firm is selling Trinity Place, a 27-storey office tower on Changshou Road in Shanghai’s Putuo District for 900 million yuan (US$124 million), according to sources familiar with the matter. The asking price is 34 per cent lower than what it paid in 2017 to acquire what was then called Central Park from Hong Kong Shanghai Alliance Holdings, according to the Post’s calculation based on a stock exchange filing.
Earlier, BlackRock forfeited two office towers in Shanghai’s Waterfront Place business zone after defaulting on a 780 million yuan syndicated loan. The office complex is now being offloaded to DCL Investments, a distressed-assets specialist, for 700 million yuan. This represents a discount of more than 40 per cent from the acquisition price in 2018, according to reports from Bloomberg.
As the nationwide property slump continues to weigh on returns, BlackRock is not the only investor dialling back its presence in China. Foreign investors were net sellers in the country’s real estate market for a fourth straight year in 2024, buying just US$5.9 billion worth of office, hotel, industrial and retail assets, the lowest level since 2014, according to MSCI.
“In 2017 and 2018, foreign investments in China’s commercial properties, particularly office buildings, were quite popular,” said Ted Li, senior director and head of capital markets for northern China at Savills. “These assets are now most severely impacted by declining rents and a significant drop in occupancy rates. There is also a decline in the overall value of the assets.”
Many owners are in a rush to sell due to a combination of factors, including the limited investment horizon and rising refinancing costs, even when the overall market is underperforming, he said."

Home prices in Hong Kong’s secondary property market dropped for a third straight month in February to near the lowest in a decade amid concerns about slower cuts in interest rates and heightened tensions in global trade stoked by extra US tariffs on foreign goods.
Lived-in home prices retreated 0.9 per cent in February from the preceding month to the lowest since July 2016, according to an index compiled by the Rating and Valuation Department. Prices have declined every month since January 2022 versus year-earlier levels - a cumulative drop of 27 per cent, the data showed.
The trend suggests bolder measures may be needed to boost confidence among homebuyers and shore up demand. Official efforts in October to ease mortgage financing rules have produced a short-lived bounce as a new round of trade hostilities erupted last month. Chances of further interest-rate cuts have diminished amid renewed worries about inflation.
The Fed and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority have kept their key rates on hold in the past two policy meetings, after cutting it three times from September to December last year.
Gains in stock prices and government incentives in the form of lower stamp duties on property transactions could help stabilise demand at current levels, according to Eddie Kwok, executive director of valuation and advisory services at CBRE Hong Kong. Prices, however, may struggle to appreciate, he added.
“We see residential prices bottoming out,” Kwok said. “However, as developers are pushing units [in new launches] to capture pent up demand, it might be difficult to record a strong rebound.” Any upside in home prices may be seen in the primary housing market, he added."

Hong Kong’s downtrodden retail sector could be headed for a turning point in coming months, as city residents show less enthusiasm for taking their money across the border for bargains in Shenzhen, according to UBS Investment Bank and JLL.
The city’s retail sales were likely to be flat this year, the Swiss bank said on Monday, an upgrade from its previous forecast of a decline as big as 5 per cent.
Amid the decline, some categories grew. Supermarket sales rose by 4.9 per cent year on year. Sales of food, alcoholic drinks and tobacco surged by 10.9 per cent. And purchases of medicine and cosmetics increased by 4.3 per cent.
The government is scheduled to announce February retail sales in the first week of April.
Meanwhile, monthly land departures by Hong Kong residents – a proxy for trips to mainland China – stopped increasing over the last six to seven months after growing as much as 140 per cent from 2018 levels."

Yet a cursory glance at the performance of luxury residential property markets reveals a remarkably resilient sector. According to Knight Frank’s prime international residential index, which monitors movements in luxury prices in the world’s top residential markets, 77 of the 100 markets tracked experienced a rise in capital values last year.
Among the five fastest-growing markets, three are Asian. In Seoul and Manila, prices rose 18.4 per cent and 17.9 per cent respectively, outpacing Dubai and Riyadh. Tokyo is fifth with 12.1 per cent growth.
Moreover, buyers get more bang for their buck in many Asian cities. While US$1 million buys only 34 square metres (375 square feet) of luxury property in London and New York, budgets stretch a lot further in Tokyo (58 square metres) and Mumbai (99 square metres).
Rising capital values and relatively affordable homes are among the reasons why Asia is fertile ground for branded residences, high-end properties associated with well-known brands and, of course, hotel chains. Asia accounts for over a fifth of the world’s branded residences."

Given the long-term trend, it is likely to take at least seven years for the demand to catch up with the supply, according to property consultancy CBRE. Office landlords would thus struggle to fill the void, it added.
“By the end of this decade, the vacancy pressure is likely going to be very similar to what we are seeing in the market today,” said Marcos Chan, executive director and head of research at CBRE Hong Kong. “That is on an assumption that the market demand will be quite similar to what we used to have, before the market experienced a downturn a couple of years ago.”
The seven-year estimate appears to be on the optimistic side. If the current net annual demand for prime office space stagnates at 1 million sq ft, it could take 15 years to fill these vacant offices with tenants, according to data cited by Edward Chan, director of S&P Global Ratings."

Hong Kong’s residential property market is showing signs of improvement following the government’s decision to lower the stamp duty for small flats, but market experts believe a buoyant stock market has played a greater role in boosting market confidence and that interest rate trends remain crucial.
“The new policy did help to improve the residential market as the sell-through rate of those small flats in recent new launches in the first-hand market was good,” said Buggle Lau Ka-fai, chief analyst at Midland. “But it may not be the main reason for the uptick in transactions.”
Centaline Mortgages said as of March 20, transactions of flats between HK$3 million to HK$4 million increased by 1.9 times over the same period in February this year and up 3.5 times year on year.
Hong Kong has seen strong weekend sales over the past three weeks. Last Saturday, 228 available flats at the new Tai Po residential project developed by Vanke Hong Kong were sold. Sun Hung Kai Properties’ Yoho West Parkside development in Tin Shui Wai also saw batches of units quickly snatched up by buyers."

Revaluation losses on the developers’ investment properties put additional pressure on their bottom lines, according to separate disclosures filed with Hong Kong’s stock exchange on Thursday.
CK Asset, one of the flagships of Hong Kong’s wealthiest man Li Ka-shing, said 2024 net profit fell more than 21 per cent to HK$13.65 billion (US$1.8 billion). Analysts, according to a Bloomberg survey, expected a profit of HK$13.57 billion.
The group’s earnings included a gain of HK$1.4 billion from the sale of a 25-storey mixed office and retail building called Harbour East in North Point to Li Ning, China’s largest sportswear manufacturer.
CK Asset’s co-developed projects in Aberdeen and Ap Lei Chau sold out. But that was not enough to offset an 84 per cent plunge in home sales on the mainland, which dragged the group’s property sales revenue down by 47.7 per cent to about HK$10 billion. Rental revenue rose 3.8 per cent to HK$6.1 billion, aided in large part by overseas assets like the Civitas Social Housing trust in the UK."

More investors are selling their investment properties in Hong Kong’s key business districts amid a prolonged slump in the commercial real estate market, despite government measures to spark a revival over the past year.
Private companies linked to Chan Hoi-wan, the 45 year old CEO of Chinese Estates Holdings and her sister Chan Sze-wan, sold two shops in Wan Chai for HK$130 million (US$16.7 million) on March 18, according to property agents. The buyers were not identified. The asking price was HK$140 million, some local media reported.
The sisters bought the two ground-floor shops measuring 3,337 sq ft and 4,773 sq ft in 2010 for HK$50 million and HK$70 million, respectively, through their private vehicles Glory City Limited and Rich Force Limited, according to Land Registry data. The shops were rented out for HK$465,000 per month, records showed.
While there is no immediate sale comparison, capital values of retail properties in Wan Chai have depreciated by 10-15 per cent over the past year, according to an estimate by property consultancy JLL.
A gauge of private retail properties compiled by the Rating and Valuation Department has slumped nearly 30 per cent since July 2022. Since the market peaked in November 2018, prices had declined by 37 per cent as of the end of last year, according to data compiled by the department."

International comparisons are fraught with difficulty, especially when it comes to contrasting markets in different regions of the world. Stages of economic development, cultural factors, levels of financial market maturity and transparency and drivers of growth can differ significantly, often making comparisons inapt or misleading.
However, provided these divergences and idiosyncrasies are taken into account, cross-regional themes and trends merit scrutiny. In the commercial property industry, one of the most insightful comparisons is sector diversification in different parts of the world.
According to JLL, office and retail assets – the two main traditional types of commercial property – accounted for 60 per cent of core real estate funds’ allocations in the Americas in 2016, with the United States comprising the bulk of investment. Industrial and logistics properties and the living sector, which includes professionally managed rental housing and purpose-built student accommodation, had a combined 40 per cent share.
In the Asia-Pacific, by contrast, office and retail properties accounted for as much as 83 per cent of real estate funds’ allocations in the region. Even in 2019, the two sectors still had a combined 68 per cent share.
This data must be put into context. First, non-listed core real estate fund data for the Asia-Pacific is based on a small number of funds focused on the region’s developed markets, in particular Japan and Australia."

The rateable value of actor and filmmaker Stephen Chow’s house at 12 Pollock’s Path on The Peak rose 2.7 per cent to HK$6.72 million (US$864,904), according to data released by the Rating and Valuation Department on Monday.
The rateable value for 2025 to 2026 is an estimate of the annual rental value of a property on the open market at the designated valuation reference date of October 1, 2024, assuming that the property was vacant. The valuation list will become effective on April 1 and subsequent changes in the market would not affect rateable values.
Rates, one of Hong Kong’s indirect taxes levied on properties, are charged at a specified percentage of the rateable value.
The metric serves as a barometer of the city’s rental market as the segment has edged up while home prices remained in a slump. In January, an index tracking rents rose by 0.42 per cent month-on-month, while lived-in home prices fell to their lowest point in eight years, according to the government data.
“[The rateable value] reflects that the overall residential leasing market remains upbeat,” said Lucia Leung, director of research and consultancy at Knight Frank.
“In the luxury segment, we have observed that some foreign professionals from international firms are planning to relocate back to Hong Kong with their families, seeking well-decorated flats with monthly rents ranging from HK$70,000 to HK$120,000,” she said. “Meanwhile, some affluent individuals from the mainland are able to afford premium accommodations with monthly rents reaching up to HK$200,000.”"

Property developer Sunac China warned investors that losses in 2024 could triple, a year after reorganising its defaulted debt with creditors, as a housing market slump continued to hurt home sales and erode the value of its assets.
Net loss could widen to about 25.5 billion yuan to 26 billion yuan (US$3.6 billion) for the year ended December 31, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Monday. The company reported a 7.97 billion yuan loss in 2023, which was mitigated by a 31.5 billion yuan gain from its offshore debt restructuring.
Tianjin-based Sunac said its onshore debt restructuring, which helped trim its debt by 15.4 billion yuan, was expected to generate a smaller gain in 2024. It did not provide a figure. Sunac plans to publish its 2024 results on March 28, according to its filing.
“The company recording a loss for [2024] was mainly due to the significant reduction in the recognised revenue as a result of the market downturn,” it said in the filing. There were also provisions for impairment on assets and contingent liabilities at the same time, it added.
China’s housing market is struggling to overcome a four-year slump, first triggered by Beijing’s “three red lines” policy to curb excessive leverage among the nation’s weakest borrowers and later compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic. Prices of new homes fell for the 21st straight month in February, the statistics bureau said on Monday."

“Since February is a traditionally slow season for the market, such a decrease is normal,” said Yan Yuejin, vice-president of Shanghai-based E-House China Real Estate Research Institute. “In the first half of the year, the housing price index will experience a continued narrowing of declines, with some cities leading the price increases.”
Across China’s four top-tier cities – Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen – new-home prices edged up 0.1 per cent month on month in February, the same increase as January. Second-hand home prices in those cities lost 0.1 per cent last month, after a 0.1 per cent gain in January.
New-homes prices were unchanged in second-tier cities, including Tianjin, Wuhan and Chengdu, compared with a 0.1 per cent rise in January. Prices of second-hand homes in those cities slipped 0.4 per cent, adding to a 0.1 per cent drop in January."

“Many banks have looked down on the property market and kept on calling investors’ loans,” said Jacinto Tong Man-Leung, the firm’s founder, vice-chairman and CEO. “As a result many investors are in a very bad financial situation and have to sell some of their properties at a price lower than the market price.”
As rental incomes sink and valuations shrink, more property owners are struggling to meet their debt obligations amid high rates, leading to a surge of distressed assets. In 2024, roughly three out of four property transactions were distressed sales, according to Reeves Yan, executive director and head of capital markets at CBRE.
In addition to calling loans – demanding immediate repayment – banks are also adjusting mortgages on commercial buildings to narrow loan ratios, Tong said. “They want you to top up the difference, as prices have dropped, or they would ask you to put down enough for six to 12 months of principal and interest,” he said.
While Gale Well had not had any loans called, “we must comply with the bank’s borrowing ratio”, Tong said.
Gale Well was selling around 10 per cent of its property portfolio to make its loan ratio more secure and “put the bank’s mind at ease, although we are not very aggressive investors”, Tong said."

Political and economic uncertainties are driving more Americans to follow the lead of wealthy people from mainland China and Hong Kong by shopping for properties – and rights of abode – overseas.
The UK, Australia and Portugal are among the favoured destinations, and property agents there have noted a significant increase in the number of US-based clients trying to line up residential options.
Official data is scant, but immigration consultants and property agents said the trend intensified following the re-election of Donald Trump, whose actions have heightened uncertainty on issues from the economy to the rule of law.
“Many Americans realised that relying on a single passport posed a risk they were no longer comfortable with,” said Basil Mohr-Elzeki, head of North America at Henley & Partners, a London-based consultant on residency and citizenship via investment.
The number of American clients calling on the firm’s services increased by more than 1,000 per cent in 2024 compared with 2019, it said. Overall, US nationals accounted for about a quarter of all applications the consultancy processed last year – nearly as many as the next four client nationality groups combined.
“That shift in mindset hasn’t faded,” Mohr-Elzeki said. “In fact, in 2025, demand for alternative residence and citizenship continues to surge. Henley & Partners has more American clients than ever before seeking a second passport or residency abroad, with high-net-worth families viewing investment migration as an essential insurance policy against the economic and political uncertainty in the US.”"

“It is very rare to see such a prime development site in the heart of Tsim Sha Tsui for sale,” said Reeves Yan, head of capital markets at CBRE Hong Kong.
He added that the price translated to an accommodation value of HK$5,200 per square foot. Accommodation value is the land acquisition cost divided by the gross floor area permitted for the project.

Swire Pacific, which controls Hong Kong’s flagship airline Cathay Pacific, reported an 85 per cent slump in earnings last year amid losses in the property business and the sale of its Coca-Cola franchise in the US.
Profit fell to HK$4.32 billion (US$556 million) from HK$28.9 billion in 2023, the group said in a stock exchange filing on Thursday, after booking deficits in the value of its development and investment properties. Excluding the deficits and other one-off charges, the group’s recurring underlying profit weakened 11 per cent to HK$9.28 billion, it added.
Cathay Pacific maintained its earnings last year as global travel rebounded further post-pandemic, it said. Swire Pacific also said it booked capital gains from the sale of its Coca-Cola franchise in the US last year to focus on its new ventures in the beverage markets in Thailand and Laos.

“The office market in Hong Kong is expected to remain subdued in 2025 as a result of the uncertainty of the economic environment” despite signs of revival in the city’s financial market, Tim Blackburn, CEO of Swire Properties, said in a separate filing. Corporate cost-cutting measures hurt demand for office space, he added.
Gross rental income from its Hong Kong office portfolio declined 7 per cent year-on-year to HK$5.1 billion, while income from its shopping malls and retail venues fell 3 per cent year on year to HK$2.4 billion due to weak demand, high vacancy rates and new supplies, the developer said. The near-term results were likely to remain subdued, it added.

Wharf (Holdings) swung to a loss last year after the commercial property developer wrote down the value of its projects in mainland China amid the nation’s real estate slump.
The company reported a loss of HK$3.22 billion (US$414 million), from a HK$945 million profit, after a write-down of as much as HK$5.99 billion from the revaluation of its investment properties.
Its underlying net profit, a reflection of the company’s business operations after excluding revaluations, fell 21.5 per cent to HK$2.8 billion. It set aside HK$2.02 billion in impairment provision, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Thursday.
Wharf’s shares fell 4.7 per cent to HK$19.40 each in Hong Kong, after plunging as much as 8.8 per cent in the biggest intraday drop since November 2022.
“Despite various government policy measures to strengthen the residential market and boost buying sentiment, sales remained slow as policy effects needed time to materialise,” Wharf said, adding that the office inventory moved slowly with minimal market demand. The rebuilding of consumer confidence remains “challenging”, the company said."

Foreign investors were net sellers in China’s commercial real estate market for a fourth year in 2024, hastening their retreat as the nation struggled with deflation and higher global borrowing costs diminished the potential for capital gains.
They bought US$5.9 billion worth of office, hotel, industrial and retail properties last year, the lowest since 2014, as risk appetite waned, according to MSCI, which tracks property transactions worth at least US$10 million. Investors also sold US$6.9 billion of assets at the same time.
The US$969 million net selling last year brought the cumulative 2021-to-2024 outflows to US$11.2 billion, exceeding the net inflows for the preceding two years combined. Since the Covid-19 outbreak in early 2020, global funds were net sellers in every segment bar industrial assets, MSCI data showed.
“The office market has welcomed a lot of new supply, meaning that existing stock has faced downward pressure on occupancy and rents,” said Benjamin Chow, head of Asia real estate research at MSCI. “Investors have been less acquisitive” since rates increased from late 2022, and were likely to wait and see until values stabilised, he added.
Office properties, once favoured by funds betting on China’s rapid economic development, bore the brunt of the retreat as vacancy rates climbed. Net disposals amounted to US$1.9 billion last year, the largest among all commercial asset classes.
Blackstone, the world’s largest alternative asset manager, sold three logistics projects in the Greater Bay Area to Ping An Insurance Group in February, according to a Bloomberg report.

Many US multinationals – long seen as shining symbols of globalisation, with their sprawling supply chains – are coming under rapidly mounting pressure as the US has slapped its trading partners around the globe with punitive tariffs.
That includes Apple, which has estimated that more than 90 per cent of its manufacturing is done in China, primarily for assembling and producing flagship products such as the iPhone and iPad.
If the world’s most valuable publicly traded company cannot secure an exemption this time around, and assuming Apple gets hit by the accumulative 54 per cent China tariffs and does not pass the added cost through, Citi analysts estimated in a research note on Thursday that it could result in a roughly 9 per cent negative impact on the company’s gross margin.
During the US-China trade war that started in 2018, Apple sought and obtained exemptions from certain tariffs on Chinese imports, including the Apple Watch and iPhone.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump announced an additional 34 per cent tariff on Chinese imports – building on the previous 20 per cent tariff that already took effect from early February – as part of his “Liberation Day” reciprocal tariff hikes affecting nearly 60 countries.
The effective tariffs on Chinese imports now amount to around 65 per cent, according to another research report from Citi."

Asia has become one of the hardest-hit regions from sweeping tariffs unleashed by US President Donald Trump, with an average rate of nearly 30 per cent levies on exports to America slapped onto countries in the region.
Experts expect Trump’s latest policy salvo, announced on Wednesday and set to take effect as early as Saturday, to spark a “global trade war” as nations retaliate with their own measures, potentially speeding up inflation in some economies.
While Trump announced a baseline tariff of 10 per cent on most US imports, significantly higher rates have been imposed on several Asian economies – calculated based on the size of their trade surpluses with the US – resulting in “disproportionately stiffer” tariffs for the region, according to an ANZ report released on Thursday.
China was the hardest hit with cumulative import tariffs now at 54 per cent, while other countries in the region excluding Singapore faced an average tariff rate of 29.8 per cent, ANZ said.
Cambodia and Vietnam will bear some of the harshest US tariff rates in Southeast Asia at 49 per cent and 46 per cent respectively, while the Philippines will have one of the lowest at 17 per cent. Singapore exporters will have to pay a baseline 10 per cent tariff in the US, while India will incur a rate of 26 per cent.
From Japan’s Nikkei 225 to Hong Kong’s Hang Seng stock index, Asia-Pacific markets plunged on Thursday after Trump’s reciprocal tariffs were unveiled, with the US accounting for about 15 per cent of Asia exports.
The American president branded Wednesday as “Liberation Day”, saying the tariffs were designed to “get money back” for the US and strengthen its economy. With reciprocal tariffs, the US is aiming to match generally higher import duties placed by other economies on American-made goods."

Beijing’s top man in Hong Kong sought to reassure local officials and political elites that the financial hub would remain “the safest” in times of “a chaotic world”, as he briefed them on the spirit of the country’s annual parliamentary sessions on Thursday, the Post has learned.
Zheng Yanxiong, director of the central government’s liaison office, spoke to more than 320 attendees about the significance of the “two sessions” for the city at the government’s headquarters in a closed-door session hosted by Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu.
“In times of a chaotic world, fortunes ebb and flow,” a source quoted him as telling the gathering of principal officials, lawmakers, and local members of the country’s top legislature and political advisory body. “There is no need for anxiety or unease, for Hong Kong remains the safest.”
On Wednesday, United States President Donald Trump announced a sweeping new set of tariffs aimed at ending what he called unfair trade policies of other countries. He said an additional 34 per cent in tariffs would be applied to Chinese imports.
According to the liaison office, Zheng called on the attendees to grasp the spirit of the “two sessions”, or lianghui, which concluded last month.
Zheng said they could do so by focusing on six main areas: giving full play to the advantages of the “one country, two systems” governing principle; persisting in reform and innovation; promoting high-quality development; strengthening internal and external connections; improving governance; and strictly guarding against risks.
He also said Hong Kong should further strengthen the function of education in fostering growth in science and technology and developing talent. The city’s roles as a global higher education hub and as a centre for international innovation and technology should also be combined, he said."

Experts have suggested that greater incentives are necessary to motivate developers to invest in and promote ecological sites in South Lantau, following the Hong Kong government’s plan to designate the area as one of three new locations for tourism and residential developments.
Their comments followed the Development Bureau’s announcement on Wednesday, inviting investors to submit expressions of interest for ecotourism development proposals for the quarry site on Lamma Island, which could be transformed into a marina for super yachts, as well as for the South Lantau Eco-Recreation Corridor, and Pak Nai and Tsim Bei Tsui in the Northern Metropolis.
The government intends to use large-scale land disposal for these three sites, a new scheme that requires developers to conduct site formation works and construct public facilities for the government, while retaining private residential sites for profit.
Francis Lam Ka-fai, former president of the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors, said that the plan required investors to build infrastructure, including roads, which would significantly affect profitability.
“The government may consider providing basic infrastructure to enhance the project’s financial viability” he said.
Lam said that profits from tourism projects were inherently unstable and influenced by various factors such as visitor numbers."

Asia is at a critical juncture. As natural disasters increase in frequency and intensity, the region remains dangerously underprepared, leaving communities, economies and industries vulnerable, especially the insurance sector.
Globally, the financial impact of natural disasters is increasing. According to reinsurance company Munich Re, economic losses surged to US$320 billion last year, up from US$268 billion in 2023 when adjusted for inflation.
As more frequent and intense hurricanes, wildfires, floods and typhoons wreak havoc on lives, infrastructure and economies, the result is higher losses, soaring insurance premiums and reduced or unavailable coverage in many regions."

Yuki Tsunoda said he had not been offered any guarantees about how long he would stay at Red Bull but was confident he could rise to the challenge, even if he was not promising to match teammate Max Verstappen from day one.
The 24-year-old was catapulted into the Red Bull seat for his home Japanese Grand Prix after the team decided to drop Liam Lawson back to Racing Bulls after only two races of the season.
“I got the first call after China from [team principal] Christian [Horner], just to be prepared that things might change,” he told reporters at Suzuka on Thursday.
“It can’t be crazier than this situation, first race with Red Bull Racing, but also on top of it in a home grand prix – it’s the best situation ever.”
Tsunoda earned his elevation by qualifying in the top 10 in the first two races of the season and earning three points for Racing Bulls, but he was quick to dampen expectations of anything like a podium finish at Suzuka on Sunday.
“I’m not saying it’s confidence that I can perform straight away like Max,” he added."

The Hong Kong government has strongly opposed the United States’ decision to impose reciprocal tariffs on Hong Kong and cancel a duty-free exemption on small parcels from the city in May, condemning the actions as bullying and unreasonable.
A government spokesman said on Thursday the levy of the so-called reciprocal tariffs on Hong Kong products, intended to reduce the risk of transshipment and tax evasion, distorted the facts and highlighted the US’ bullying behaviour aimed at suppressing its opponents.
“The actions of the United States are bullying and unreasonable, violate the rules of the World Trade Organization and wilfully undermine the multilateral trading system as the cornerstone of international trade,” he said.
The spokesman added that until May 2 Hongkong Post would “temporarily maintain” postal services to the US and not collect any tariffs on behalf of American authorities.
“The Hong Kong government will continue to closely monitor and assess any unilateral measures of the US ... and take actions to defend Hong Kong’s legitimate interests, including filing of a complaint in accordance with the WTO dispute settlement mechanism,” he said.
The government also noted the US was Hong Kong’s third-largest trading partner, with bilateral trade totalling US$60.3 billion in 2023. Hong Kong has generated a US$271.5 billion trade surplus with the United States over the past years, representing the largest one among the city’s trading partners."

Chinese semiconductor developer Loongson Technology has released its next-generation of chips as part of a strategy to “enter new era of AI processors”, according to company statements.
The new processors, designated 2K3000 and 3B6000M, share identical silicon but differ in packaging; one for industrial control applications and the other for mobile devices. Both integrate eight Loongson’s central processing unit (CPU) cores, which are based on its LoongArch instruction set architecture.
For graphics performance, the chips are embedded with the company’s self-developed, general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU). Loongson claims this GPU delivers a “multiple-fold improvement” over its predecessor, providing enhanced general-purpose computing and AI acceleration capabilities.
“Building upon our established foundation in general-purpose and graphics processors, Loongson has entered a new era of intensive AI processor development,” the company said. “This represents a new leap toward establishing a self-sufficient information technology ecosystem.”
Software ecosystems to support the new chip are currently being finalised. Dozens of manufacturers specialising in industrial control systems and information technology solutions have already started integrating the processors into their product designs."

Speaking after The Everest favourite Ka Ying Rising’s Group Two Sprint Cup (1,200m) demolition job at Sha Tin last Sunday, Engelbrecht-Bresges did not rule out the possibility of the world’s best sprinter representing the Jockey Club in the world’s richest turf race.
“I think one has to see what the financial incentive is if we work with [the Australian Turf Club]. I think it’s something we can consider,” said Engelbrecht-Bresges.
“But, it cannot be only a slot in The Everest. It has to be something which benefits us. Having a slot in The Everest would benefit the owner but not necessarily us.”

There is likely to be a spot available for this October’s A$20 million (HK$98.5 million) The Everest, with reports on Wednesday suggesting Star Entertainment will relinquish its A$700,000 slot.
Ka Ying Rising’s trainer, David Hayes, said in February that “going forward I think Hong Kong sprinters will target The Everest because it’s a logical race for them”.
For Engelbrecht-Bresges, increased Australian participation in Hong Kong’s flagship meetings – the Hong Kong International Races in December and April’s Champions Day – would be a key pillar of any negotiations.
“In general, we discuss with multiple partners how we can create more international events,” said Engelbrecht-Bresges.
“If you could create links between a certain event in Australia and events here, then I think we could develop an ecosystem.
“I am optimistic that probably in the next six or seven weeks we will have a clear path around how we can globally work more strongly together, especially with Australia because Australian sprinters are a must [in Hong Kong’s big races].”
Hayes has long said he’ll wait until after Ka Ying Rising’s final run of the season before he gets serious about slot negotiations, with the world’s best sprinter set to conclude his 2024-25 campaign in the Group One Chairman’s Sprint Prize (1,200m) on April 27.
Romantic Warrior has hardly put a foot wrong during one of the most audacious overseas raids ever launched by Hong Kong connections, and with him every step of the way have been a group of Danny Shum Chap-shing’s staff who wouldn’t have missed it for the world.
While many people have chipped in during the journey, which began in December, mafoo Chan Chung-yin and work riders Gary Lau Ka-tai and Andy Luk Wai-hin have been the mainstays.
Some of Shum’s staff have been on the road for nearly four months and they have ridden every bump of a journey that saw a blistering victory in January’s Group One Jebel Hatta (1,800m) and a heartbreaking second in February’s Group One Saudi Cup (1,800m) on the dirt.
Victory in Saturday’s Group One Dubai Turf (1,800m) would provide the ultimate end to Romantic Warrior’s Middle Eastern mission.

“They’re all happy. They’re looking forward to Saturday, then after two weeks quarantine they’re looking forward to going back to Hong Kong,” said Shum.
“They’ve done a great job. As you can imagine, four months away from home is a big challenge for them. But it’s a great experience.”
The enormity of the efforts of the travelling brigade is not lost on jockey James McDonald, who has jetted in and out from Australia to partner Romantic Warrior.
“We can’t thank them enough for the work they’ve put into this horse and they’ve left no stone unturned,” said the Kiwi.
“This is the last race of this little journey and hopefully all goes well.”"

However, this first small-screen outing for the director experiences a few growing pains in its early episodes as he looks to match his madcap style to the traditional K-drama formula of the series’ script.
The show is built around a simple and amusing concept with plenty of potential for social observation – an actuary looks to resuscitate his flagging career by pitching a “divorce insurance” product to his company.
Divorces are sad, messy and expensive, but a fact of life for many people although few expect it to happen to them. In a country that is struggling with low marriage and birth rates the show’s theme may appear to make light of the phenomenon, but it is easy to see a path to the typical K-drama happy ending here."

Banks in China could face more bad loans, potentially hitting 6.4 per cent of total lending next year, according to a forecast by S&P Global Ratings, as higher US tariffs weigh on an economy that is still struggling to shake off the lingering impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The warning came in a report on Thursday, after President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs on all US trade partners, including a 10 per cent levy on all imports and higher rates for about 60 countries with large trade surpluses against the US. China will face an additional 34 per cent rate, on top of the 20 per cent imposed earlier this year.
If the tariffs hit harder and China’s property sector does not hit its bottom, banks’ non-performing assets (NPA) ratio could approach the peak of 6.5 per cent seen during the Covid lockdown period in 2022, S&P said. As a result, credit losses could rise to 2.7 trillion yuan (US$370.4 billion) next year and exceed 3 trillion yuan by 2027, it added.
“It never rains but it pours,” the report said, referring to the multiple challenges faced by the world’s second-largest economy in recent years, including the pandemic and the property market crisis. “And it now faces additional strains from more US tariffs on its exports.”

A three-time winner of the handicap worth about HK$19 million in prize money, Purton has been set a task after Moira drew barrier 21 for her Australian debut for trainer Chris Waller.
The last-start Group One Breeders’ Cup Filly & Mare Turf (2,200m) winner will come into gate 18 if the reserves don’t gain starts.
Moira, a winner at seven of 17 starts, was bought by Yulong Investments for US$4.3 million (HK$33.5 million) at the Fasig-Tipton November Sale in America after her Breeders’ Cup success.

“Obviously, she won the Filly & Mare there at the Breeders’ Cup in good fashion,” said Purton, who has won the Doncaster on the Waller-trained Sacred Falls (2014), It’s Somewhat (2017) and Mr Brightside (2023).
“She can definitely run a strong mile. She’s never been right-handed before, so that’s definitely a bit of a question mark and Chris hasn’t had her for too long.
“It’s a strong race. Being a handicap, there are going to be a lot of chances in the race but she’s an exciting mare to get on and I just hope that she can bring her best on the day so that the people of Canada – she was Horse of the Year there – [have] something to cheer for and also the people of America as well.”
Purton isn’t the only Hong Kong rider chasing Doncaster success, with Andrea Atzeni taking up the opportunity to ride Al Mubhir for British trainer William Haggas.
Al Mubhir has won four races, including the Listed Gala Stakes (2,011m) at Sandown Park last year, from 24 starts.
“William approached me a while ago and said Al Mubhir was going to run in the Doncaster Mile,” Atzeni said.
“He asked me if I was happy to go and ride him and obviously, I said ‘yes’. I actually rode him in the Lincoln [Handicap at Doncaster racecourse] a few years ago and he was favourite for the race. It looks like an open race and with a light weight, he should be competitive.”
Karis Teetan was set to join Purton and Atzeni in the Doncaster, but his mount Rise At Dawn was relegated to first reserve when the final field was released earlier this week.

While Moira and Al Mubhir are double-figure chances in an open race, Hugh Bowman shapes as the Hong Kong rider best placed to achieve Group One glory at Randwick when he rides Rivellino in the Inglis Sires’ (1,400m).
Bowman is adamant the Kris Lees-trained colt should have finished much closer than fourth when he was held up at crucial stages in the straight in the Group One Golden Slipper (1,200m) last start.
“I was really taken by him in the Golden Slipper,” Bowman said.
“He’s a pretty good horse. Hopefully he can get away a bit better than he did – he jumped a little bit slow but he just didn’t get into stride at all.”
Rivellino is the $4.20 second favourite in fixed-odds markets. Bowman will also ride long-shot Red Aces in the Group One ATC Australian Derby (2,400m)."

South Koreans legally become adults at 19 years old. Under Korean laws, engaging in sexual intercourse with minors aged between 13 and 16 or committing intimate acts with those under 13 is considered rape, which is punishable with up to life imprisonment.
“The age limit for statutory rape … has allowed a paedophile, who seduced and deceived a promising female actress from childhood until her death, to evade the law,” said the petitioner, who also called for a stiffer penalty for statutory rape.

The HKFC Standard Chartered Soccer Sevens will this year welcome three overseas women’s teams to compete for the first time, organisers revealed on Thursday.
Welsh side Wrexham AFC Women, Thailand’s Chonburi FC Women and Eastern Thunder from Singapore are the three international teams that will compete alongside Hong Kong’s TSL, Kitchee and Hong Kong Football Club.
Last month, organisers announced that Premier League academies Aston Villa, Brighton & Hove Albion, Newcastle United, Leicester City and West Ham United would take part in the men’s section of the seven-a-side football competition from May 16 to 18.
“We are excited to be entering a women’s team into the HKFC Soccer Sevens tournament for the first time,” Wrexham chief executive Michael Williamson said.
“The tournament also provides fast-paced football and high-level opposition to test the players at the end of what has been another successful season on the pitch for our women’s section, at both first-team and under-19s level.”"

About one-third of newly reported cases of HIV infection in Hong Kong are low-risk groups, including housewives with only one sexual partner, health authorities have found.
The Centre for Health Protection warned on Thursday that low-risk groups had a high possibility of identifying their infections at a later stage due to limited awareness, calling for them to get check-ups.
The warning came despite the number of cases declining nine years in a row. There were 365 cases of HIV infection last year, dropping from 725 in 2015.
A total of 74 new Aids cases were reported last year, dropping from 101 in 2023.
“We always feel that HIV infection is something that only concerns certain high-risk groups,” said Bonnie Wong Chun-kwan, a consultant with the Centre for Health Protection’s special preventive programme.
But she noted that about a third of the newly reported cases were not in high-risk groups, with more than 60 per cent being late presenters who had their infection detected at a later stage."

The euro appreciated more than 1 per cent to the strongest in six months, approaching the closely watched $1.10 level. Stocks in Europe slumped 1.8 per cent.
US President Donald Trump announced Wednesday he will apply at least a 10 per cent tariff on all exporters to the US, with even higher duties on some 60 nations to counter large trade imbalances with the US. Canada said it will fight tariffs with countermeasures while China has also vowed to retaliate.
The harsher-than-expected tariffs threaten to raise prices on trillions of dollars in goods imported into the US each year. US stock futures tumbled about 3 per cent, surpassing losses in Chinese shares even as the Asian nation faces a tariff of well above 50 per cent on many goods.
“The aggravation of US growth concerns on the tariff news and related further falls in US stocks has meant that the dollar isn’t enjoying its traditional safe haven, reserve currency status support,” said Ray Attrill, head of foreign-exchange strategy at National Australia Bank Ltd."

A new festival will bring a taste of Brazil to Hong Kong this summer, with activities such as samba dancing, reggae drumming and freestyle football set to attract at least 30,000 participants and foster a better understanding between the two cultures, its organiser has said.
The 10-day “Extravaganza! When Brazil Meets Hong Kong” will take place across 10 locations along Victoria Harbour in Central, Wan Chai and Tsim Sha Tsui, and feature free activities for participants.
“I really hope that by bringing people here … we’ll have a broader understanding and appreciation of what’s happening on the other side of the planet,” Dr Stefan Matzinger, founder and CEO of the festival, said.
He added that the festival would allow Hongkongers, who could not easily take the 30-hour journey over two flights to Brazil, to experience the culture of the Latin American country in their own city.
“We might find there a lot of similarities [between the two places], you [too] have carnivals, parades and dancing here,” he said.
Brazilian Deputy Consul General Hervelter de Mattos hailed the event as “creating a new cultural bridge” by introducing the “soul” of his country to the city."

BYD plans to increase its sales network in South Korea, a car market dominated by local producers Hyundai Motor and Kia Corp, as it pushes for more deliveries outside its home stronghold of China.
“We will increase our sales network to 30 by the end of this year from 15 to meet demand from Korean consumers,” Liu Xueliang, the general manager of BYD’s Asia-Pacific auto sales division, said at the Seoul Mobility Show in Ilsan city on Thursday.
BYD has not been in the South Korean market for very long. It only debuted its passenger brand of cars in January when it officially launched its Atto 3 electric SUV. While the Chinese auto giant is known for its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies, it is up against strong competition from incumbents. Hyundai and Kia sold some 1.2 million cars in South Korea last year for a 75 per cent market share.
BYD introduced its Seal mid-sized sedan at the auto show, with a price starting from 47.5 million won (US$32,400), excluding subsidies. BYD’s booth at the Seoul Mobility Show was one of the largest. It also showcased a range of its other models, displaying a total of six vehicles.
The Shenzhen-based carmaker has enjoyed a robust start to 2025, with sales up 58 per cent in the first quarter versus the same period of last year.
Over the course of the past month, BYD has delivered a series of product releases that have generated a huge amount of buzz, including smart driving technology for most of its models at no extra cost and an ultra-fast charging system that can add 400km of range in just five minutes."

As the hours-long debate in the Lower House grew heated as the Congress-led opposition firmly opposed the proposal, calling it unconstitutional and discriminatory against Muslims. Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party lacks a majority in the Lower House, but its allies helped to pass the bill.

Later on Thursday, lawmakers in the Upper House began debating the bill. At least eight hours have been set aside for discussion.
Minority Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju introduced the bill to change a 1995 law that set rules for the foundations and set up state-level boards to administer them."

Beijing’s foreign affairs representative in Hong Kong has met the top US envoy in the city to lodge “solemn representations” against the latest sanctions imposed by Washington on six mainland Chinese and local officials.
Cui Jianchun, the commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, also told US Consul General Gregory May on Wednesday that Beijing would resolutely retaliate against Washington’s hegemony.
The meeting took place a day after Washington announced its latest round of sanctions. Among those targeted in this round were Justice Secretary Paul Lam Ting-kwok and former police commissioner Raymond Siu Chak-yee, over what the US called the “transnational repression” of opposition activists under the city’s national security laws.
Washington also submitted its latest Hong Kong Policy Act Report to the US Congress, concluding that both central and Hong Kong authorities had continued to use national security as a broad and vague basis to undermine the rule of law and protected rights and freedoms in the city.
Beijing’s foreign affairs arm in Hong Kong on Thursday said Cui met May the day before to express his “solemn representations” against the US’ “unreasonable sanctions” and its latest report on the city.
“[Cui] has expressed strong condemnation and firm opposition to the US’ gross interference in Hong Kong affairs and China’s internal affairs, and sternly warned the US side not to underestimate China’s resolute determination to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests,” the office’s statement said."

Trump on Wednesday announced that he will apply a minimum 10 per cent tariff on all exporters to the US and slap additional duties on around 60 nations with the largest trade imbalances with the US.
Cryptocurrencies bore the announcement relatively well at first, but began to falter as traders began their day in Asia.
“As a risk-on asset, cryptocurrencies have generally traded poorly during periods of uncertainty following announcements such as steady high rates or the introduction of trade tariffs,” said John Wu, president at Ava Labs."

For Richard Cottle, owner of a concrete-mixing business on Norfolk Island, there was only one explanation when US President Donald Trump unveiled a hefty 29 per cent tariff on the tiny territory about 965km (600 miles) off eastern Australia: “it was just a mistake”.
Though the rugged volcanic island in the southern Pacific does ship a modest amount of Kentia palm seeds abroad, typically worth less than US$1 million a year, mostly to Europe, news of the unusually steep tariff passed through its 2,188 residents on Thursday with a mixture of amusement and confusion.
“Norfolk Island is a little dot in the world,” Cottle said by phone. “We don’t export anything.”
Norfolk Island was among dozens of tiny territories which appeared on the same list as China and the European Union as recipients of Trump’s highly anticipated tariff regime, even though they do not have a real manufacturing or export industry.
Some, like the Heard and McDonald Islands in the Antarctic, which like Norfolk Island is overseen by Australia, did not even have human inhabitants. No matter – as of Thursday, they faced a 10 per cent tariff for exports to the US.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, on the campaign trail ahead of an election in a month, told the media his country did better than most with a tariff of 10 per cent – half of what the EU was hit with and one-third of what China got – but he had no explanation for Norfolk Island."

Tired of living in the shadow of the great Silent Witness at home in Hong Kong, the David Oughton-trained Cape Of Good Hope hit the road – racing a remarkable 12 times overseas and bagging wins in the Group One Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Stakes (1,200m) in the United Kingdom and the Group One William Reid Stakes (1,200m) at Moonee Valley in 2005.
A Group Three winner in Hong Kong, the John Size-trained Howdeepisyourlove has produced consecutive Group One third placings behind superstar sprinter Ka Ying Rising and the classy Helios Express.
“Anyone who has been in Hong Kong for as long as I have remembers the Cape Of Good Hope story, where he got sick of chasing Silent Witness so they said ‘let’s go overseas’ and they took him around the planet and started winning races,” said bloodstock agent David Price, who sourced both Silent Witness and Howdeepisyourlove.
“I’m not quite sure it’ll be the same as that, but I know how much John likes this meeting and this just looked such a good target for him.
“You sit there and go ‘do we want to keep chasing [Ka Ying Rising] or do we want a little bit of glory ourselves?’.”
In chasing his first Group One success, Howdeepisyourlove will also be hunting a first overseas victory for trainer Size and a breakthrough Al Quoz Sprint win for Price’s Price Bloodstock operation.
It’ll be the third year in a row Size and Price have had a presence in the Al Quoz Sprint, with Sight Success running fourth in 2023 and fifth behind fellow Hong Kong galloper California Spangle last year.
“We’ve had a couple of goes at it – it just fits. It’s such good timing,” said Price, who also had the David Hall-trained Bundle Of Joy run fifth in the race in 2015.
“I feel like Howdeepisyourlove looks like a slightly upgraded model [compared to Sight Success] and it’s hard not to be excited by what we’re seeing on paper.
“I would say this is as good as one of ours has looked going into an overseas race out of most of the recent ones,” added Price, who tasted Group One glory abroad thanks to Silent Witness’ victory in the 2005 Sprinters Stakes (1,200m) in Japan.
A $3.20 favourite in fixed-odds markets, Howdeepisyourlove’s closest market rival is British galloper Believing, who he beat home by seven lengths when running fifth in last April’s Group One Chairman’s Sprint Prize (1,200m).
“I’m really looking forward to his race,” said Howdeepisyourlove’s jockey James McDonald. “He’s a really good horse who’s really consistent, so I think that’s a really good thing when travelling.
“He’s competed against the best sprinter in the world at the moment in Ka Ying Rising. Obviously a fair way back behind him, but he’s always second or third duelling it out with Helios Express.
“I think that formline is as good as any sprinting formline around. You could safely say if Ka Ying Rising was in this field he’d be a very short-priced favourite and probably winning by four or five lengths, so we’re in the ballpark and I think he’s a terrific hope.”
Hong Kong has a strong record in the Al Quoz Sprint, winning it three times from 17 runners, and Price knows a fourth success would mean a lot to all involved, including Colin Lo Chor-cheong – who raced Bundle Of Joy and is part of the Lo Profile Syndicate that owns Howdeepisyourlove.
“I’m always happy when they win for other people, so it’s a little bit unique,” he said.
“There’s a couple of syndicate members who have been good friends for a long time and they can’t believe we’re on this ride. I’m very excited to be a part of it, that’s for sure.”"

Tesla’s first-quarter deliveries on the mainland fell to the lowest level in three years, slumping nearly 22 per cent as its Chinese rivals clipped at its heels with newer and more affordable electric vehicles (EV).
The US carmaker delivered 172,754 cars from its Shanghai Gigafactory 3 in the first three months of the year versus 220,876 units in the same period a year earlier, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association. The sales were also the lowest since the second quarter of 2022 when 122,100 cars were delivered. The deliveries include sales on the mainland and exports.
In March, deliveries jumped 157 per cent year on year to 78,828 units, after production of a refreshed Model Y was ramped up. On a monthly basis, deliveries fell 11.5 per cent from 89,064 units in February.
“Competition in the Chinese market remains fierce and Tesla’s sales in its major markets outside China are stuck in a downward spiral,” said Phate Zhang, founder of Shanghai-based EV data provider CnEVPost.
Meanwhile, BYD, the world’s top EV maker, extended its lead over Tesla in the pure EV category for a second quarter. Including hybrids, it has been dominant for 12 quarters. Shenzhen-based BYD delivered 416,388 units of pure EVs in the first quarter, an increase of 39 per cent from a year earlier, while sales of hybrids soared 76 per cent to 569,710 units."

A Hong Kong man has been convicted of rioting with a white-shirted mob at a railway station during the 2019 anti-government unrest after a judge overturned his acquittal.
The District Court on Thursday reversed its original findings that were in favour of transport worker Wong Chi-wing, 60, ruling that he was indeed one of the participants in the attack at Yuen Long MTR station on July 21, 2019, according to the overall evidence.
The Yuen Long resident was the only one of eight defendants cleared in the 2021 trial, in which the identification of suspects became a major issue in contention.
District Judge Eddie Yip Chor-man found insufficient evidence to support Wong’s conviction, highlighting differences in facial features between him and an assailant caught on camera during the incident.
But the Court of Appeal ruled that the conclusion was “perverse” and made without full consideration of incriminating circumstantial evidence, including the time Wong left and returned home that night and the similar outfit seized from his residence.
Yip said on Thursday that he acknowledged he placed too much reliance on CCTV footage that only showed the assailant wearing a mask, while overlooking clips in which he apparently removed his facial covering."

Jacky Cui Yongxi, one of the few Chinese players to break into the NBA, has vowed to return to top-level basketball when he recovers from a knee injury that saw him waived by the Brooklyn Nets.
Cui joined the Nets on a two-way, two-year contract in September but saw his time in the United States cut short when he suffered a season-ending ACL injury while playing for G League affiliate Long Island in December.
The 21-year-old went back to his hometown in Yulin in China’s Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, following surgery on his left knee but is now back in New York, hoping to revive his career.
“[On] social media, a lot of people thought I’m done,” Cui told NBA G League.
“[But] a lot of people, like 70 to 80 per cent, think I will get back to the NBA. And the doctor told me this knee can be fixed 99 per cent [of the time].”
The 6ft 5in (1.96-metre) guard said he “heard a pop” when he landed while challenging for the ball against the Maine Celtics, which led to his devastating injury."

Despite the largest search in aviation history, the plane has not been found.
Loke’s comments come just one month after authorities said the search had resumed, following earlier failed attempts that covered vast swathes of the Indian Ocean.

The 1999 action game Shenmue has been named the most influential video game of all time following a survey organised by Bafta, the British association that honours films, television, and video games.
The series, created by Japanese designer Yu Suzuki, stars a young Ryo Hazuki as he seeks to avenge the death of his father, killed by a mysterious martial arts specialist.
The game is split into three instalments (Shenmue I, II, and III) and was, at the time of the first instalment’s release, the most expensive game in history to produce.
Having become a cult classic among many gamers, Shenmue is known as a pioneer in open-world gaming and for popularising the “quick time event”, a moment in which the player is asked to perform a specific action within a given time limit.
“Games are an immensely innovative force and it’s brilliant to recognise those titles which have truly shaped the course of our medium,” said Luke Hebblethwaite, head of the Bafta video games division."

China’s central bank set the fixing rate for the yuan against the US dollar at its lowest level since January on Thursday, as the Chinese currency came under pressure following US President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariff hikes.
Gold prices surged to a record high on Thursday as investors sought a safe haven, prompting Chinese regulators to issue a warning about market volatility.
The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) set Thursday’s yuan fixing rate – also known as the midpoint rate – at 7.1889 per US dollar, the lowest level since January 17, following a sell-off of the offshore yuan.
But the fixing rate is still much stronger than the offshore market level, which indicates “the PBOC’s efforts and strategy to stabilise the yuan remain unchanged”, said Raymond Yeung, chief Greater China economist at ANZ Bank.
The offshore yuan had dropped to 7.349 against the US dollar earlier in the day, its lowest level since early February, following the news that the United States planned to raise tariffs on Chinese imports by 34 per cent.
By midday on Thursday, the offshore yuan had strengthened slightly to trade at 7.306 per US dollar."

Hong Kong start-up Wada FoodTech takes groundbreaking bento vending machines to Japan
As entrepreneurs in Hong Kong embark on their growth journeys, they can turn to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) for guidance along the way. As part of its mission to promote Hong Kong as a hub for global investment and business, the HKTDC works with start-ups as well as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to create tangible opportunities for them to expand internationally, in addition to providing business information and advisory services.
One such start-up that has benefited from its support is Wada FoodTech, a smart catering solutions provider originally based in Hong Kong’s Cyberport business park but which now has additional offices in Tokyo and Osaka. The company, which uses the brand name Wada Bento, has developed decentralised food vending machines that serve hot meal boxes to hungry customers in as little as nine seconds.
Established in 2018, Wada FoodTech helps optimise food management across the catering supply chain. Its recent expansion in Japan – a country famous for its bento boxes and vending machines – is testament to the strength of both the firm’s offering and strategy.
In early December, the HKTDC held its annual Entrepreneur Day (E-Day) at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. This event serves as a platform for entrepreneurs to tap into global markets, offering opportunities for networking and business matching along with support services tailor-made for start-ups.
The 2024 edition of E-Day also featured the InnoClub Awards, which spotlight groundbreaking start-ups and SMEs from the Greater Bay Area. WadaFood Tech received the InnoClub Industry Impact Award in recognition of its innovative digitised model for food service, which leverages patented hot-chain vending machines and AIoT, or “artificial intelligence and Internet of Things” technology, to strengthen food safety controls while also boosting efficiency.
In addition, WadaFood Tech signed a memorandum of understanding with Harada Corporation during E-Day. The Japanese general trading company has experience in a wide array of businesses, including food innovations, that can help the Wada Bento brand strengthen its presence in the Japanese market.
Wada FoodTech, which also showcased its technology at the event, said the partnership reflected the company’s commitment to expanding its vending machine operations in Japan, with a focus on Tokyo and Osaka."

Park Hae-joon, once infamously known in South Korea as the “nation’s adulterer” for his portrayal of an unfaithful husband in the 2020 drama The World of the Married, is reclaiming his screen persona – this time as the “nation’s romantic lead”.

George Jarvis said he is “here to take over” ahead of his second fight with Mouhcine Chafi at ONE Fight Night 30 on Saturday.
Having earned his spot on the big stage with a stunning finish of Rungrawee Sitsongpeenong last November which earned him a coveted US$100,000 contract with the organisation, Jarvis said the best is yet to come.
“Yeah, you know, what a night that was,” he told the Post. “Mixed emotions – one thing led to another, and eventually, we walked out with the contract I wanted so badly and deserved so much. A good knockout as well.”
But as Jarvis knows, making it to the top requires more than just skill in the ring.
“To get these opportunities is one thing,” he added. “Doing it in the ring, I’d say 90 per cent of what you do in the ring gets you these opportunities, but every now and again, you need to be able to speak up and state the facts.
“I didn’t say anything on the night that I didn’t believe was true. Everything I said was everything I’ve already done. So, you need to speak up, let the people hear what you have to say, and get what you deserve.”"

Nintendo revealed details of the machine during an hour-long livestream, including a new chat feature and a separate video camera. The company also announced several new games, including Mario Kart World, a new entry in the popular Mario Kart series, which will release alongside the system.

Following news of Val Kilmer’s death at age 65, many fans have returned to one particular scene in the actor’s storied film career: his last one, opposite Tom Cruise, in the 2022 blockbuster Top Gun: Maverick.
In a cameo role, Kilmer reprised his character of Tom “Iceman” Kazansky, whom he originated in 1986’s Top Gun.
Kilmer’s Iceman, a former naval aviator risen to the rank of admiral, offers words of advice to his long-time friend and one-time rival pilot, Cruise’s older, but not necessarily wiser, Pete “Maverick” Mitchell.
Those words, “It’s time to let go,” are now resonating with Kilmer fans.
At Cruise’s insistence, the 2022 Top Gun sequel found a way to include Iceman in the story and to accommodate his friend Kilmer’s real-life struggles with throat cancer, which had significantly affected his ability to speak."

On Thursday, the Hang Seng Index dropped 1.5 per cent to 22,849.81 at the close, a level not seen since February 20, while the Hang Seng Tech Index slumped 2.1 per cent. On the mainland, the CSI 300 Index slipped 0.6 per cent and the Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.2 per cent.
For the week, the Hang Seng Index was down 2.5 per cent to cap a fourth straight losing week. Financial markets in the city and on the mainland will be closed on Friday for a public holiday.
Global traders shifted to haven assets after US President Donald Trump unveiled tariff rates on what he called “Liberation Day,” with gold prices reaching a record high again and the yield on US Treasuries slipping. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 Index futures slumped at least 3 per cent during Asian trading hours.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 2.7 per cent on concerns that a sharp appreciation in the yen will weigh on exports; South Korea’s Kospi retreated 0.8 per cent and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.9 per cent.
“The scale of these tariffs raises concerns about growth risks,” said Tai Hui, a strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Hong Kong. “This policy announcement is likely to dampen risk sentiment in the short term. Risk assets, including US and Asian equities, may face pressure. The fear of weaker growth currently outweighs inflation concerns, potentially driving safe-haven flows into government bonds.”"

On Thursday, the MPF reported a HK$34.8 billion investment return in the first quarter, according to data from MPF Ratings, an independent research firm.
The MPF’s 379 constituent funds generated an average return of 2.7 per cent in the first quarter, the best performance since a 4.1 per cent gain in the first quarter of 2023. For 2024, the MPF posted a return of 8.8 per cent.
The results boosted the MPF’s total assets to HK$1.338 trillion as of the end of March. The sum, which takes into account investment gains and new contributions from members, works out to HK$279,100 per person. That was 13 per cent higher than a year earlier, indicating an average portfolio increase of HK$30,000 per member.
“Notably, Hong Kong and China equities led all asset classes in the first quarter while US equities slumped,” said Francis Chung, the chairman of MPF Ratings.
“This performance difference should serve as a harsh lesson for the record number of MPF members who switched out of Hong Kong and China equities and into US equities last year.”"

With each passing match, it’s becoming more difficult to justify any type of interest in the English Premier League title “race”.
At this point, Liverpool would need a total collapse – and even then for Arsenal to become relentless.
Still, it’s at Anfield where we start our Wednesday night round up.
No matter the form, David Moyes plus Everton at Anfield can never equal victory.
Once again it was Liverpool who prevailed as Diogo Jota’s second-half goal gave the hosts a 1-0 derby win which restored their 12-point lead over Arsenal at the summit.
It means the Reds need only 13 points from the 24 remaining to win just their second title in the Premier League era.
Elsewhere, the race for the top five is getting more intense with wins for Manchester City, Newcastle United – who have a game in hand – and Aston Villa.
The latter saw Marcus Rashford score for the second match in a row as they beat Brighton 3-0 away from home to leapfrog the Seagulls and move into seventh place – two off the Carabao Cup winners in fifth."

The rental charge for the 4,540-sq ft (421.8 square metres) space occupying three floors - currently under renovation - has risen by a fifth since the Transformers restaurant’s owner iFree vacated the shop, agents said.
Still, the rent is about an eighth of the monthly charge of HK$8.6 million that Burberry paid in 2015 to the landlord Soundwill Holdings during Hong Kong’s pre-pandemic retail boom. The British fashion brand ended its lease in 2021, two years into a slump that was sparked by anti-government protests and followed by the pandemic-era travel restrictions. Transformers restaurant took over the space from Burberry.
“We have seen more leasing activities, but they have not translated into higher rents,” said Martin Wong, senior director and head of research and consultancy for Greater China at Knight Frank.
Russell Street is in one of Hong Kong’s main shopping districts. Shops along the 250-metre long thoroughfare had to pay US$2,671 per square foot on average in annual rent as recently as 2018.

The rich aroma of tofu hangs in the air in a back room at Hong Kong’s Kung Wo Beancurd Factory restaurant in the Kowloon neighbourhood of Sham Shui Po.
At this Hong Kong institution, soy products are made daily using a time-honoured – and time-consuming – process.
Every morning at 2am, a stone grinder whirls into action, crushing pre-soaked soybeans into soy milk that is then boiled in copper pots and stirred until smooth and velvety.
“I think people would be shocked if they knew that a square of our tofu takes about 13 hours to make,” says Renee So, the owner and director of Kung Wo Beancurd Factory who, in 2013, gave up a career in finance to take over the business from her father, So Sung-lim.
Kung Wo’s history stretches back more than 130 years to 1893, when it was founded by a migrant from mainland China’s Guangdong province called Lok Gong.
Originally located in Tsim Sha Tsui, it moved to its current location on Pei Ho Street in 1958. Lok passed it on to his son, Lok Wing-tung, who later sold it to Rennie’s father – who was a loyal customer – when he left Hong Kong in 1997."

“Current measures lack sufficient substance to impact the already established online manufacturing capacity, which is the primary reason international PV module and input pricing remain so low,” said Joseph Johnson, associate director for market intelligence at US advisory firm Clean Energy Associates (CEA), in a report on Tuesday.
The Chinese government recently said it would address industrial oversupply this year. In February, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) said it would limit expansion of low-quality production capacity with policies to be unveiled later this year focused on technological development, industry standards and intellectual property rights.
“While efforts are likely to cool investments in new production capacity, this does not mean that a sharp market correction will be induced by the policy measures,” Johnson said. “Instead, a gradual recovery in pricing is anticipated.”
In China, solar cells, modules, and polysilicon have seen moderate price increases since the beginning of the year, which is largely attributable to a rush of solar panel installations after the National Energy Administration issued a new policy covering distributed solar power generation in January. The policy applies to projects put into operation after May."

Ching Ming Festival, also known as tomb-sweeping day, is celebrated 15 days after the spring equinox in the Chinese lunar calendar, and in 2025 falls on April 4. In mainland China and Hong Kong, the festival is a public holiday.
Its name originates from the saying “plants start to revive and prosper at Ching Ming in a clean and bright way”, according to People’s Daily. The literal translation of the Chinese ching is “clean” or “pure”, while ming means “bright”. The festival was traditionally seen as marking both the beginning of warm spring weather and of farm work.
The customs of the festival as we know it today originate from hanshi jie, or the Cold Food Festival.
According to legend, in the 6th century BC in the Chinese state of Jin, an exiled duke called Wen was starving and had no food to eat, so one of his followers, named Jie Zitui, cut a piece of his flesh from his thigh to make soup for Wen.
Wen was grateful for the meal and wanted to pay Jie back.
However, the story does not end well: when Wen eventually became the ruler, he forgot about Jie, who had moved to a remote mountain with his mother.
When he learned of his saviour’s whereabouts, he ordered his army to set the forest on fire, hoping to force Jie out of hiding.
The fire raged for three days and eventually the emperor saw Jie and his mother clinging, dead, to a charred willow tree. He buried them under the tree.
Out of remorse, Wen decreed no fires were allowed on the anniversary of Jie’s death, forcing people to eat only cold food; this marked the beginning of the Cold Food Festival."

“This place makes no sense!” yells Natalie (Emma Myers) in A Minecraft Movie, the barmy new big-screen take on the hugely popular world-building video game.
After watching it – assuming you’re not familiar with the 300-million selling sensation – you’ll probably agree. But that does not mean you will not have a good time.
The story takes place in the Overworld, a pixelated paradise occupied by Steve (Black), a kid who dreamed of building things and found his wish in this bizarre universe.
After the discovery of something called the Orb of Dominance, Natalie and her brother Henry (Sebastian Hansen) are sucked through a portal into this place, where the normal rules of physics do not apply."

As the weekend deadline for TikTok to find a buyer approaches, bidders for the short-video social media site are piling up.
Amazon and, separately, a consortium led by OnlyFans founder Tim Stokely are the latest to throw their hats into the ring for TikTok. The site faces an April 5 deadline to reach a deal to find a non-Chinese buyer under threat of being banned from the United States.
US officials have raised security concerns over the app’s ties to China, which TikTok and owner ByteDance have denied. Trump administration officials are meeting on Wednesday to discuss the various options for TikTok.
Start-up Zoop, which is run by Stokely, founder of adult content social media site OnlyFans, has partnered with a cryptocurrency foundation to submit a late-stage plan to bid for TikTok, the two said on Wednesday.
A US administration official confirmed Amazon had sent a letter to US Vice-President J.D. Vance and Department of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Amazon declined to comment, while TikTok and ByteDance did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Shares of Amazon rose about 2 per cent following news of the last-minute TikTok bid.

NWD, one of the most indebted developers in Hong Kong, said on Monday that it planned to launch Front Tower, a grade-A office building valued at 1 billion yuan (US$137 million) this year in the capital of eastern Zhejiang province, which is home to a number of tech companies including Alibaba Group Holding, DeepSeek and Unitree Robotics. Alibaba owns the Post.
“Hangzhou is driving high-quality economic development through the rapid growth of emerging industries and innovative technologies,” said New World executive director and CEO Echo Huang Shaomei in a press release. “With its thriving innovation, the city is set to become a leading world-class hub for the artificial intelligence industry.”
Front Tower has a total of 280,000 sq ft, and its floors range in size from 16,000 to 38,000 sq ft. The tower is located in Wangjiang New Town[comma] and the company said it was seeking to cater to growing demand for premium office space.
The tower is part of the New World City Arts Centre, an 8 million sq ft commercial complex that includes grade-A office buildings, a luxury hotel, a shopping centre and residential flats. It is about 2.5km from the West Lake and 1.5km from the Qiantang River, two of the city’s most visited tourist attractions."

More financially stressed property owners are putting their assets in Hong Kong up for sale at big discounts this year as high borrowing costs weigh on mortgage repayment while experts project further market weakness.
Savills is helping the Lun family of Winland Group to find a buyer for Winland House, an 84,510 sq ft commercial building in Cheung Sha Wan, for about HK$700 million (US$90 million). The family also hired Savills to sell some units in Lippo Centre in Admiralty for about HK$450 million, or 36 per cent below its acquisition cost eight years ago.
The Lun family was also said to have recently sold three floors in Shun Shing Building in Tuen Mun for HK$118 million, and two floors in Odeon Building in North Point for HK$107 million, according to local news reports.
“We have seen a 20 to 30 per cent quarter-on-quarter increase in the stock list,” said Reeves Yan, executive director and head of capital markets at CBRE Hong Kong. “These property owners wanted to reduce debt to ensure their financial status remained healthy.”

Policymakers in the US and Hong Kong kept their key interest rates unchanged last month amid new inflation challenges, after lowering them three times last year. The policy uncertainty has become the biggest factor stoking leverage concerns among property owners.
Borrowing costs were expected to remain high in the next six to 12 months, offering investors little relief on mortgage repayment, Yan added."

On his first test over further than 1,800m, Jumbo Legend ran on powerfully from eighth on the turn to beat equal $3.5 favourite Fallon by a neck in a tight finish.
The six-year-old was a two-time winner at both 1,200m and 1,650m at the city circuit before passing his first staying test with flying colours.
“My boy told me [about this race], he said ‘you’ve got to put this in the 2,200m’,” Caspar Fownes said.
Strong win, Jumbo Legend! 💪 Caspar Fownes' galloper picks up a first 2200m win at the Valley by denying Fallon in a thriller... @HarryBentley_ #HappyWednesday | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/X4KOElGJKx
“I said ‘stop having a lend of me’. It was great. We nailed it and Ronan was good there, he felt the horse had a good pair of lungs and could do something [at the trip].
“[Jumbo Legend is] an honest horse. He ran a good race last start with a good sectional at 1,800m. It was a good finish – they were fighting down the straight and it was nice that we got the winning result.”
After travelling smoothly four-back on the rail, Jumbo Legend was hooked out to the centre of the track by Bentley to launch his run at the top of the straight.
The son of Hinchinbrook successfully chased down Fallon, who had raced to the lead just before the 150m. They raced well clear of the equal favourite Charity Gain, who was beaten three lengths in third.
“Stepping up in distance was a slight question mark,” Bentley admitted.
“I was happy with how he came into it and he relaxed beautifully. Fallon really stuck his head out and obviously the weight played a bit of a part, but take nothing away from this lad’s victory.”
Kaholo Angel relished a return to the city circuit when he chased down Happy Fat Cat to score by a head in the Class Three Kyoto Handicap (1,200m). The grey had run two seconds from his past five starts, which were all at Sha Tin.
Kaholo Angel also handed Andrea Atzeni a double after he booted home Cody Mo Wai-kit’s Crystal Powerful in the Class Four Japan Racing Association Trophy (1,000m).

Elsewhere, Zac Purton notched his first Valley win since returning from injury on Aestheticism in the Class Three Tokyo Handicap (1,650m).
Purton, who returned last Sunday after fracturing a toe on February 9, kept Aestheticism out of trouble and the Pierre Ng Pang-chi-trained gelding streaked home to land his first win of the season.
“The connections have been waiting for a Class Three win and it was great to have Zac back on,” Ng said after Aestheticism beat Definitive by a length and a half.
“It’s been frustrating – he’s sort of a horse that comes from the back and can be unlucky. Hopefully he’ll get more mature and win more races in the future.”
Richard Kingscote finished his Hong Kong stint on a successful note when he booted home Giant Leap in the second section of the Class Four Nakayama Handicap (1,200m).
In town since mid-February as injury cover, the British jockey bagged his first success at the city circuit to go with a breakthrough treble on the Sha Tin dirt a week earlier.
It was fitting that the last victory of his stint was for trainer Ricky Yiu Poon-fai, who supported Kingscote as he often does with new riders in Hong Kong.
“I’m really happy. Obviously tonight’s my last night, so it’s nice to get another one. I’m very grateful to Ricky and his team – they’ve supported me a lot since I’ve been here. It’s good,” Kingscote said after Giant Leap got the better of Nebraskan by half a length."

Chris Thornton loves talking about playing basketball on the most fragile-sounding of surfaces: glass.
Thornton is managing director of the Americas division of ASB GlassFloor, a German company building floors made of fused-together layers of safety glass covering LED panels.
The courts are a far more dynamic visual feast, with customised playing lines, logos, colours, animated graphics and advertisements for multiple sports.
In basketball, where wood is still king, Thornton sees growth potential for glass courts – already showing up in the NBA and internationally – as a tech-driven alternative to the sport’s long-running hardwood foundation.
“I use this analogy a lot: we’re at the initial stages of the iPhone being launched,” Thornton said.
“Way back when Apple did that, the design of the hardware has changed, but more importantly the original iPhone was just a phone, a text device and music player. Now you’re running your entire life and communicating to the world on it. I see this in the same regard.”"

Adrian Cheng Chi-kong, the former CEO of New World Development (NWD), bought HK$20 million (US$2.57 million) worth of convertible bonds sold by a medical equipment leasing firm, in his first known investment since stepping down from the top job at the troubled developer last year.
Cheng’s personal investment vehicle SummitEdge Capital bought the short-term securities issued by Ziyuanyuan Holdings Group on Wednesday, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing. The bet showed his confidence in the medical and healthcare industry, a person familiar with the deal said.
Ziyuanyuan has a mandate to issue up to HK$100 million worth of bonds. The firm earlier placed HK$32 million of them on March 26 to Hainan Mingda Investment, a mainland-based company owned by Huang Pingan and Zhang Mingyuan, the firm said in a separate filing last week.
The convertible bonds pay 6 per cent annual interest and mature after 18 months, according to the filing. They may be converted into the company’s ordinary shares at HK$1.51 per share.
If fully converted, Cheng and Hainan Mingda would own 2.71 per cent and 4.7 per cent of the firm’s enlarged share capital, respectively.
Cheng, scion of Hong Kong’s third richest family, stepped down as CEO of NWD in late September, soon after the developer reported a record HK$19.7 billion loss for the year to June 2024. His successor, Eric Ma Siu-cheung, lasted two months, and was replaced by Echo Huang Shaomei."

The International Ice Hockey Federation has deemed forward Hannah Miller ineligible to represent Canada at the upcoming women’s world hockey championships because of her recent playing tenure in China.
According to Hockey Canada, the IIHF cited its rule requiring a two-year break from when the player represented another nation.
The 29-year-old Miller is from North Vancouver, British Columbia, and last represented China at the 2022 Winter Games under the name of Me Li.
Now in her second season with the PWHL Toronto Sceptres, Miller previously played for China-based KRS Shenzhen in a five-year stint ending in 2022-23, when the team competed in the Russian women’s pro league.
“We are extremely disappointed to learn that Hannah is not able to compete for Canada at the upcoming world championship,” Gina Kingsbury, Team Canada’s general manager, said in a statement.
“We remained optimistic and believed she had met all the conditions outlined by the IIHF to represent her country, including the two-year timeline around the transfer portal,” added Kingsbury, who also doubles as the Sceptres GM."

Hong Kong road endurance coach Ben Kersten has overseen the first triumph of his reign, after the city’s women’s team won the three-day Tour of Thailand.
Star athlete Ceci Lee Sze-wing was second in the individual race, behind fourth-time winner Jutatip Maneephan. Lee claimed the white jersey awarded to the best young rider.
Kersten, the former Australian Cycling Academy managing director, was appointed last month. Soon after, he led a six-strong men’s contingent to the five-stage Tour of Taiwan, where 70th-placed Cheung Shi-ho was Hong Kong’s best performer.
In Thailand, however, Australian Kersten masterminded success for the quintet of Lee, Leung Wing-yee, Leung Bo-yee, Yang Qianyu and Kwan Tsz-kwan.
“It’s a positive start for Ben with Hong Kong … it’s his first time with the women’s team, he’s an experienced coach, and he gave them good plans and a lot of confidence,” said Herve Dagorne, the Hong Kong head coach, who had sought reassurances before his team travelled on the situation in Thailand following last week’s deadly earthquake in the country.
“On every stage, the team worked very hard together and followed the strategy, so it’s encouraging for [November’s] National Games, when the race will also be flat. It’s good for the team’s morale – they will come back feeling confident.”"

The 10-time Group One winner, who returns to the Meydan course and distance of his track-record blitz in January’s Group One Jebel Hatta (1,800m), continues to thrive after more than three months in the Middle East.
“It seems like he’s taken no side effects from Saudi, he’s bounced out of it well – all guns blazing, really,” said New Zealander McDonald, who is missing two Group One meetings in Sydney to ride in Dubai.
“I don’t think he’s taken a backward step from Saudi so hopefully he runs well.
“He seems to love it here in Dubai – how can you not? It’s a great place. He seems to be very happy, healthy and he’s working well.”
After taking a sit from gate one in the Jebel Hatta, trainer Danny Shum Chap-shing is confident Romantic Warrior again has options this weekend after landing gate nine at Wednesday morning’s barrier draw at Meydan.
“Gate nine is not a problem. He’s flexible. If he gets a fast pace, [McDonald] can give him a chance to settle. If the race is slow, he can sit close,” said Shum, adding that he was thrilled with his superstar’s final piece of fast work on the Meydan turf on Tuesday morning.
“He’s very fit at the moment so I talked with James McDonald and asked him to give him a happy, easy, smooth gallop on the turf and let him enjoy the work.
Roll on the Dubai Turf! 💙

“James gave me a very positive report. He said the horse is very fit. He loves the horse. The horse loves it here and he is very happy here.”
Romantic Warrior will have plenty of time to find a position down the long back straight in a race featuring reigning Dubai Turf champion Facteur Cheval, Godolphin’s Nations Pride and a pair of Japanese gallopers who finished runner-up at December’s Hong Kong International Races – Liberty Island and Soul Rush.
“This race is a stronger race than what he competed in in January here but he’s very good,” said McDonald, who will also ride Howdeepisyourlove and Sword Point for Hong Kong on Saturday night.
“He’s a horse that thrives on high pressure and obviously the tougher the races, the better he goes, as we’ve found out over the years.
“He’ll be up for the challenge again. Obviously, it’s a very competitive race with some very strong contenders and he’ll have to be at his brilliant best.
“I think if he runs up to the Jebel Hatta run, he’ll be very hard to beat.”
Romantic Warrior is the red-hot Dubai Turf favourite in fixed-odds markets and Howdeepisyourlove is also proving popular in betting for the Group One Al Quoz Sprint (1,200m) down the Meydan straight.
Considered around a $3 chance, Howdeepisyourlove will look to land a second consecutive Al Quoz Sprint victory for Hong Kong after the success of California Spangle 12 months ago.
“It seems OK, he should be able to get a clear run from there,” said trainer John Size after Howdeepisyourlove joined Romantic Warrior in drawing gate nine.
“The horse gets back in the field a little bit and hopefully he’s a late finisher and that should probably suit him.
“The horse is in pretty good shape and he’s travelled well. He looks good and he’s done his work properly.
“He continues to do well, so I think the race is coming up at the right time and it’s a matter of circumstances on the day for these sort of events.”
Hong Kong’s final runner on Dubai World Cup night, the Frankie Lor Fu-chuen-trained Sword Point, will jump from gate two in the Group Two Godolphin Mile on the dirt."

While only a handful of companies can afford to develop in-house general-purpose LLMs, many smaller companies have shifted to focus on building specialised applications around publicly available models."

The Hong Kong head coach, Andrew Wright, has predicted an Olympics future where “spectator-friendly” sprint triathlon replaces standard distance races.
Talking before Hong Kong hosts this weekend’s Asia Sprint Championships, Wright also tipped the 70.3-kilometre half-ironman discipline for Games inclusion.
Hong Kong will have eight men and four women competing in Saturday’s Central Harbourfront races, which feature swimming, biking and running legs covering 750 metres (0.47 miles), 20 kilometres and 5km, respectively. The comparative Olympic distances are exactly twice as long.
“You can see where triathlon and other sports are going: their popularity depends on them being spectator friendly,” Wright said. “We are moving to short, sharp, fast and entertaining distances.
“It might be that [in major Games], you have the 70.3km, which is very popular, and the sprint. The Olympic distance can be a bit boring, watching athletes parading around on the bike for an hour.”
After World Triathlon began awarding equal ranking points for sprint and standard races, there is plenty on the line this weekend for the home athletes trying to secure National Games qualification. Any top-five finishers will be guaranteed spots for November’s home event."

Disney+’s Hyper Knife marks a bold new chapter for actor Park Eun-bin, who sheds her wholesome image to portray a sociopathic doctor in the series – a striking departure from her previous roles.
Her intense performance on set has reportedly drawn praise and even astonishment from the crew.
Known for consistently choosing challenging roles, Park returns as Jung Se-ok, a once-promising genius surgeon who now performs operations at an illegal clinic.
What sets this project apart from her previous work is the towering presence of veteran actor Sul Kyung-gu. While Park led previous hits like Extraordinary Attorney Woo and Castaway Diva as a solo star, Hyper Knife introduces a new dynamic with Sul as her counterpart.
As her first foray into an original streaming platform series, it raises the question of whether it will be another career-defining role."

“I look forward to staying here, becoming a better player and trying to represent Hong Kong. I chose Hong Kong over other countries because of its welcoming environment and the opportunity to contribute to its growing basketball scene and bring success to Hong Kong.”

Masses of basalt columns rise vertically from the valley floor for 100 metres and more, as if glued together like gigantic organ pipes.
The geological phenomenon in the Garni Gorge is called the “Symphony of Stones”, natural works of art in the country of Armenia, which markets itself as a land of “hidden wonders”. It attracts visitors with mountains, monasteries, ruins and vineyards, but it is not overrun by tourist crowds.
Yerevan is the gateway to Armenia. The capital city is a balancing act between the old and the avant-garde, between sober Soviet architecture and hip designer bars.
Outside the city limits, you rumble over patchworks of tarmac, through mountain landscapes and fertile valleys.
Along the road, friendly locals sell their mini harvests of apples, tomatoes, watermelons and potatoes from baskets and cardboard boxes.
They need every dram (one-quarter of one US cent) they earn from selling them. Incomes are low – the monthly wage of a teacher is equivalent to one night in a luxury hotel in Yerevan. This explains why there are more Armenians living abroad than in their homeland of three million people."

As more people embrace health-conscious living, anti-ageing diets – designed to slow the ageing process – have emerged as a major movement in the food and wellness scene, pushing superfoods into the spotlight.
Farro, an Italian word meaning ancient wheat grain, is often used to describe three different grains – einkorn, emmer and spelt – but primarily refers to emmer, which is produced in large quantities in Italy today.
Originally cultivated and eaten more than 2,000 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia and once a staple for Roman soldiers, it is still popular in Italian and other Mediterranean cuisine. It has now attracted renewed attention for its impressive nutritional profile and versatility in modern meals."

Asian state-owned investors (SOIs) are projected to grow their assets under management by 34 per cent over the next five years, aided by growing economies, healthier fiscal balances and bigger contributions from the continent’s relatively young population, according to Global SWF.
These sovereign investors, which include 146 central banks, sovereign wealth funds and public pension funds, could grow their assets to US$25 trillion by 2030 from an estimated US$18.7 trillion currently, the US-based organisation said in a report on Tuesday. The sum would collectively represent one-third of the global total, it added.
“As countries and their citizens reap the rewards of the integration with the global economy, policymakers hope to capitalise on their position to continue their growth stories, buoyed by favourable demographics and geographic position,” the report said. To meet ambitious development goals, policymakers must raise additional revenue while reining in public spending, it added.
Asia contributed roughly US$35 trillion to global gross domestic product and represented 60 per cent of economic growth last year, according to Global SWF. It is also home to 46 sovereign wealth funds with US$4.8 trillion of assets as of April 2025.
The report highlighted the prolific deal-making of Singapore’s Government Investment Corp or GIC and Temasek, among the world’s top spenders. Between January 2020 and April 2025, the Singaporean duo accounted for almost three-quarters of all capital deployed by Asian sovereign investors to top destinations like the US, India, UK and China."

French hotel group Accor has warned that forward bookings from Europe to the United States are down 25 per cent this summer as travellers who feel put off by US President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration divert to other locations.
The company is seeing a “pretty strong deceleration” across the Atlantic, chief executive officer Sébastien Bazin said. The drop is an acceleration from an 18-20 per cent decline in the first 90 days of the year, he said. Travellers are deciding to visit places such as Canada, South America and Egypt instead of the US, Bazin said.
“You don’t need any bad buzz today,” Bazin said.

Walking through a Michigan plant past whirring robotic arms and flying sparks, Swamy Kotagiri, the CEO of Canada-based auto supplier Magna reflected on how he is trying to “control the uncontrollable” in the midst of industry-shaking tariffs.
“We’ve had a series of black-swan events,” Kotagiri said. “Our industry really prospers with certainty and cadence and stability. And that is what’s been missing in the last four years.”
The vastness of Magna’s facility in Michigan underscores its role as a key cog in the intricate global auto supply chain. The company has 59 facilities in the United States, 50 in Canada, and another 33 in Mexico, part of the legacy of the 1990s North American Free Trade Agreement that produced a highly intertwined system of sending parts from one country – and then back again – to produce cars in some of the world’s largest markets.
Speaking just hours before Trump called for the 25 per cent tariffs, Kotagiri said there was no “easy way to absorb this,” saying much of the cost would be passed on to consumers. Trump’s levies are expected to add thousands of dollars in cost per vehicle and billions for carmakers and suppliers, analysts say."

Zhang Yiming, the founder of ByteDance and China’s richest man, has not obtained Singaporean citizenship, according to a statement from Douyin, the Chinese sister app of TikTok.
Douyin said it was not true that Zhang, 42, has obtained Singaporean citizenship, in an apparent response to a Tuesday report by Singapore’s Chinese-language newspaper Lianhe Zaobao, which claimed he had done so.
The original report was deleted from the Singapore newspaper’s website as of Wednesday morning, but it stirred significant interest in China as the nationality of the country’s super-rich is a sensitive issue.
According to the country’s nationality law, a Chinese national has to give up citizenship if he or she obtains citizenship from another country. Singapore has become a safe haven for China’s new generation of wealthy individuals in recent years as they try to find a middle ground between China and the US.

Former comedian Simon Yin is now the managing director of Stackd, a new indoor pickleball facility in the Hopewell Mall shopping centre in Wan Chai. He spoke to Andrew Sun.
I am an emotional eater. When the going gets tough, I eat. My comfort food has always been chicken wings – fried, baked, BBQ, hot, cold, sweet.
My wing addiction stems from growing up in a Chinese restaurant in Atlanta, in the US state of Georgia. Legend has it, whenever I cried, my mom would stick a chicken wing in my mouth and that shut me up.
For an all-out rockin’ good time, Sushi Kuu (1/F, M88, Wellington Place, 2-8 Wellington Street, Central. Tel: 2971 0180) is my place. Chef Satoru-san never disappoints. Sitting at the counter, it is like we get dinner and a show. Knocking down a couple of Samurai cocktails always helps."

Val Kilmer, who starred in films such as Top Gun, The Doors, and Batman Forever while earning a reputation as a Hollywood bad boy, has died. He was 65.
The cause of death was pneumonia, The New York Times reported, citing his daughter Mercedes Kilmer.
The California-born, Juilliard-trained actor was one of Hollywood’s most prominent leading men in the 1990s before numerous spats with directors and co-stars and a series of flops dented his career. Over the years, Kilmer gained a reputation as temperamental, intense, perfectionistic and sometimes egotistical.
“When certain people criticise me for being demanding, I think that’s a cover for something they didn’t do well. I think they’re trying to protect themselves,” Kilmer told the Orange County Register newspaper in 2003.
“I believe I’m challenging, not demanding, and I make no apologies for that.”"

Joelle Pineau, the vice-president leading Meta’s Fundamental AI Research group, known as Fair, announced her departure on Tuesday. Pineau has been at the company for eight years, has led the Fair team since early 2023 and reports to chief product officer Chris Cox.
Her group oversees Meta’s AI research efforts, focused on everything from voice translation and image-recognition technology to the company’s open-source large language model, called Llama. The unit also explores development of what Meta calls “advanced machine intelligence”, or human-level intelligence for machines.
Pineau, who’s also a computer science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said she will remain at the company until May and then take some time to “observe and reflect”.
“Today, as the world undergoes significant change, as the race for AI accelerates, and as Meta prepares for its next chapter, it is time to create space for others to pursue the work,” she wrote in her note to colleagues. Pineau also posted her announcement on social media."

When The Last of Us – the smash hit series about a post-apocalyptic society ravaged by a mass fungal infection – arrived on our screens in 2023, the real world was emerging from a pandemic.
Part of the show’s strength is its ability “to see human relationships under crisis and in pain, and intelligently draw political allegory, societal allegory, and base it off the world we’re living in”, said the actor, who plays lead character Joel.
“Storytelling is cathartic in so many ways … I think there’s a very healthy and sometimes sick pleasure in that kind of catharsis – in a safe space,” he said.
In the first season, smuggler Joel is forced to take teenage Ellie (Bella Ramsey) – seemingly the one human immune to the deadly cordyceps fungus – with him as he crosses the United States seeking his brother."

Manuel Bleda said he was “dreaming” of a first call-up for the Hong Kong team after recovering from three operations on a badly damaged knee, and gaining a new contract with Eastern.
The Spain-born forward obtained his passport in February 2024, when he was still laid up with the torn cruciate ligament he suffered the previous summer. A return at the end of last season proved to be a false start, when Bleda, who was on loan from Lee Man, played as a substitute in Eastern’s FA Cup final win over Sham Shui Po, but “could still feel my knee was not secure”.
“When I got the passport last year, I wanted to play [for Eastern] as a local, but also to help the Hong Kong team,” Bleda said. “I was unlucky with my injury … I went back to Spain [after the Cup final] and the doctors said my ACL was not working.
“I needed more surgery, and was back to the first day [of rehabilitation].”
The following nine months were “difficult every day”, as Bleda recovered with Eastern. He said he would “see my teammates training, while I was in the gym”. “It was a very hard time … I needed a strong mind,” he added.
After recapturing fitness, Bleda was handed a contract with Eastern, where he spent three years after coming to Hong Kong in 2016."

The frenzy to create Ghibli-style AI art using ChatGPT’s image-generation tool led to a record surge in users for OpenAI’s chatbot last week, straining its servers and temporarily limiting the feature’s usage.
Average weekly active users breached the 150 million mark for the first time this year, according to data from market research firm Similarweb.
“We added 1 million users in the last hour,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in an X post on Monday, comparing it with the addition of 1 million users in five days following ChatGPT’s red-hot launch more than two years ago.
Active users, in-app subscription revenue and app downloads reached an all-time high last week, according to SensorTower data, after the AI company launched updates to its GPT-4o model, enabling advanced image generation capabilities.
Global app downloads and weekly active users on the ChatGPT app grew 11 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, from the prior week, while in-app purchase revenue increased 6 per cent, the market intelligence firm said."

We’re well and truly in the business end of the football season with every match worth that little bit more.
In the English Premier League, at least, there’s not too much still undecided but pressure does funny things to you.
So let’s start our Tuesday night round-up with title challengers Arsenal’s 2-1 win over Fulham at the Emirates.
Bukayo Saka scored just seven minutes into his return to put Mikel Arteta’s side 2-0 ahead after Mikel Merino’s first-half opener before Rodrigo Munoz pulled one back in stoppage time.
However, there was more bad news for Arsenal as influential defender Gabriel had to be substituted after just 16 minutes through injury.
The result leaves the Gunners nine points adrift of Liverpool, whose game in hand sees them welcome derby rivals Everton to Anfield at 3am on Thursday, Hong Kong time.
Elsewhere, Nottingham Forest fans can surely start preparing for the Champions League now, as they earned yet another three points with a 1-0 win over Manchester United.
Former Red Devil Anthony Elanga ran from his own box on five minutes to slot past Andre Onana for the game’s only goal."

Sales of new and lived-in homes, shops, office units, car parking spaces and industrial properties jumped 55 per cent in March from a month earlier to 6,661 lots, while the transaction value soared 61 per cent to around HK$45.65 billion (US$5.9 billion), according to Land Registry data released on Wednesday.
The official data was in line with estimates made a day earlier by Midland Realty and Ricacorp Properties, two of the city’s largest property agencies.
“With favourable property market measures [announced] in the budget at the end of February and the strong performance of Hong Kong stocks in recent months, new property sales have been outstanding,” said Midland chief analyst Buggle Lau Ka-fai.
The bullish momentum is likely to be sustainable, with the forecast for deals in April to reach 7,040 lots, Ricacorp said. That would be the highest monthly transactions since the 7,695 lots in November, the agency said.
The revival in the city’s real estate industry vindicates the stamp duty cuts announced in February by Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po, who slashed the levy on homes worth up to HK$4 million to HK$100 from HK$60,000. The previous threshold was HK$3 million. The change could spur sales of HK$4 million flats to account for 30 per cent of private home sales, up from 25 per cent in 2024, CBRE said.
In the first quarter of the year, 901 homes priced at HK$4 million or below were sold, which was about 138 per cent higher than the fourth quarter, according to Midland. In March alone, 442 of these homes in this price range were bought."

The city would be “a perfect venue for Formula One” and should campaign to stage a race or risk being left behind by its neighbours, a Hongkonger who worked on the successful bid to bring the elite motorsport to Thailand has said.
Bangkok is expected to be part of the F1 schedule from 2028, joining Japan, Singapore and Shanghai as Asian stops on an increasingly congested calendar that now has 24 events on it.
With South Africa and Rwanda among other places also aggressively bidding to join the circuit, Hong Kong could leverage F1’s booming popularity in China to become “a serious player in international sport”.
According to data released last week, the high-speed bonanza added almost 90 million new fans last year, with a 39 per cent increase registered on the mainland in the past 12 months.
And with Las Vegas reporting a race-week economic impact of US$934 million from staging a grand prix in 2024, when the gambling hub said visitors spent an average of US$2,400 on “non-race-related expenditures”, Hongkonger Frank Yu Siu-fung called making a bid “a no-brainer”.
“Hong Kong is due to have a major international event,” said Yu, who was appointed to lead the technical team to work with F1 and the Thai government as part of its successful bid. “The Sevens is great, we had Formula E, but other than World Cups, there is nothing like Formula One.

Xiaomi said the car was travelling at 116kph on a highway with the driver assistance system in operating mode, adding that the system alerted the driver to take over the vehicle two seconds before it hit a concrete barrier.
While Xiaomi did not mention the number of fatalities involved, the mother of the driver said in a social media post that three people – the driver and two passengers – died in the crash."

Chen Hang, who created the app in 2015 and left Alibaba in 2021 to pursue his own venture, will return as the new DingTalk CEO. The news comes as Alibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, plans to acquire a stake in Chen’s Hangzhou-based start-up HHO, the representative said.
HHO has raised at least two funding rounds since its launch, with backing from venture capital funds, including Vision Plus Capital, an investment firm started by Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu Yongming, according to Chinese corporate database Tianyancha.
The leadership reshuffle was first reported by Chinese tech news outlet 36Kr on Monday. Ye Jun, the former CEO of DingTalk, will transition to a new role within Alibaba, according to 36Kr. He is currently working in Alibaba’s CEO office, according to his DingTalk page.
The changes highlight Alibaba’s intensified focus on AI, as the Hangzhou-based firm seeks to capitalise on the global frenzy around generative AI models and specialised applications, an area of particular focus for the company.
DingTalk, with 700 million users as of the end of 2023, is seen as a key asset in Alibaba’s AI strategy. The app generated more than US$200 million in annual recurring revenue – primarily from subscriptions – in the first half of the company’s financial year, covering the six months through September."

New World Development plans to sweeten the terms of two loans it is seeking, using a prized asset that it has already pledged as collateral for another facility, people familiar with the matter said this week.
Under the revised terms for the two loans, which total HK$87.5 billion (US$11.2 billion), the Hong Kong developer would offer the Victoria Dockside complex as a second-ranking security to banks, adding it to the approximately 40 other properties already in the collateral pool, the people said.
The term-sweetening would be made on the condition that the cash-strapped company obtained a new HK$15.6 billion loan that Victoria Dockside is intended to back, the people added. They asked not to be identified as they were discussing private matters.
The arrangement would give the two lenders some extra support, though they would rank lower than those on the new loan when it comes to the asset.
In addition, Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, which is controlled by the family of billionaire Henry Cheng Kar-shun, would offer what is known as a “letter of comfort” for the two loans, the people said. A letter of comfort is usually issued by a borrower’s parent or major shareholder to its lenders to show support, though it may not be legally enforceable.
New World, also controlled by Cheng’s family, faces one of the highest debt burdens among Hong Kong developers, as the city’s property market remains mired in a slump. The company has been in discussions with banks since January as lenders have grown increasingly cautious over its liquidity conditions."

Siobhan Haughey has ended her months-long break from swimming, announcing her return to the pool in a social media post with the caption “Here we go again”.
The decorated Olympian posted a photo of herself smiling happily in the water at the Hong Kong Sports Institute on Monday.
Haughey last swam competitively at the World Aquatics Swimming Championships last December in Budapest, where she won the women’s 200 metres freestyle to complete a hat-trick of titles, after also winning in 2021 and 2022, in Abu Dhabi and Melbourne.
But after that, the 27-year-old revealed she had considered retiring before opting to instead take a three-month break to consider her future as a professional athlete.
In a recent interview with the Post, Haughey’s coach, Tom Rushton said she planned to resume training on April 1, with the intention of returning to elite competition at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore this July.
Rushton said the double silver and bronze medallist would take part in the city’s Long Course Swimming Trials on April 12 and 13 before joining up with his team for a high-altitude camp in Andorra."

Beinao No 1, a semi-invasive BCI system developed by the Chinese Institute for Brain Research (CIBR) in Beijing and its affiliated start-up NeuCyber NeuroTech, completed their first three human implants between February and March this year, the companies said last week.
The Chinese government, meanwhile, is moving to support the market for BCI products, which are inching closer to commercialisation.
The local government in China’s central Hubei province on Monday released the country’s first pricing guidelines for the operation, stipulating that invasive BCI implants should cost 6,552 yuan (US$902) per procedure, and that the price of removal should be 3,139 yuan per procedure. The province set the fitting fee for a non-invasive BCI product at 966 yuan.
The Beinao system allowed paralysed patients, including a paraplegic patient with spinal cord injury and a hemiplegic stroke survivor, to exert mind control to operate computers and robotic arms. It can also decode and output Chinese speech of an ALS patient with speech disorder, according to the companies."

The Australian ace got the best out of M Unicorn when he took off from near the tail of the field to take up the lead at the 800m, with the Caspar Fownes-trained gelding sustaining his run to score by two lengths on March 19.
A five-time winner last season, the son of Savabeel racked up his fifth success over the Valley’s extended mile to reach a peak career rating of 80.
He rises six pounds to carry top weight of 135 in Wednesday night’s Class Three Tokyo Handicap (1,650m), but Bowman’s chief concern is the six-year-old’s issues jumping cleanly out of the barriers.

“He’s in good enough form, he’s just a bit quirky at the start of the race,” Bowman said.
“If I could get him out and get him involved early, he should just win. He’s just a bit difficult that first 50m. Sometimes he doesn’t jump well, other times he does jump well but won’t jump into gear. He just gets beaten for speed.
“Then if you rev him up, he won’t relax. You’ve just got to go with the flow a little bit.
“We won’t know until the gates open. It was a solid win last start, he was strong through the line and even before that, he was racing well. He’s a big horse so the weight isn’t a concern.”
In addition to his habit of starting slowly, M Unicorn was withdrawn from a Valley race in February when he lunged forward in the barriers pre-race, resulting in his gate opening and him galloping for a short distance before he was captured.
M Unicorn jumps from gate five in a competitive race. Consistent galloper Aestheticism will have admirers when he reunites with champion jockey Zac Purton, who rides at the Valley for the first time since February 5 after returning from a toe injury.
Second behind Purton in the premiership with 51 wins this term, Bowman also rides Capital Legend, Ragnarr, Nebraskan, Thunder Prince, last-start winner Dragon Four Seas and Nordic Dragon at the midweek meeting.
“I think Nordic Dragon’s going well. If I drew a bit softer than seven, I’d be really keen on him. He’s just going to need the race run to suit him,” Bowman said."

China may be making waves in a slew of emerging industries – from robotics to electric cars – but an official Chinese research body has placed the country only 10th in its latest global innovation league table.
The report, released on Monday by the Academy of Science and Technology for Development (CASTED), evaluated the innovation capabilities of 40 countries that collectively account for over 85 per cent of the world’s gross domestic product.
China has risen up the rankings faster than any other nation since 2012, according to the report, but the country has remained in 10th place for the past three years.
The United States ranks first in the latest edition of the league table, followed by Switzerland. The other countries placed above China on the list are South Korea, Sweden, Denmark, Japan, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany.
This helped China rise from 20th in the innovation league table in 2012 to 10th in 2024, with the report noting the country’s “increased investment in innovation, remarkable knowledge output, stronger corporate innovation, and an improving innovation ecosystem”, according to state broadcaster CCTV."

The 20-times English champions are likely to face a Hong Kong Select XI, although a suggested May 31 date for the fixture would clash with the local FA Cup final at Mong Kok Stadium.
It was confirmed on Monday that Kai Tak Stadium will stage a Hong Kong Football Festival in July, with Liverpool playing AC Milan on the 26th, and Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur meeting in the first overseas North London derby five days later.

In addition, John Sharkey, the Kai Tak Sports Park CEO, said the stadium’s playing surface had been taken to a “turf nursery” after the weekend’s Cathay/HSBC Hong Kong Sevens, to be repaired for the marquee July fixtures.
Manchester United are expected to play in Malaysia before coming to Hong Kong, with both matches organised by ProEvents, the long-standing promoters who have previously delivered a number of leading European clubs to Hong Kong and multiple other Asian destinations."

The Rossoneri have been crowned European champions on seven occasions, while Liverpool have won the same trophy six times.
The two sides met in the 2005 and 2007 Champions League final, with each earning a victory – and Baresi is looking forward to watching the rivalry continue in Hong Kong.
“When you play for a great club like Milan and you travel the world, you always have a responsibility to do your best and respect the job at hand as well as to people who have come to watch,” Baresi told the Post. “We have a historic rivalry with Liverpool so it’s always an important match. Between us, we’ve been champions of Europe 13 times.”

A baseball card autographed by Shohei Ohtani and featuring a piece of the trousers the Dodgers’ superstar wore while becoming the first MLB player to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in a season has sold for more than US$1 million (HK$7.78 million).
The one-of-a-kind Topps Dynasty Black card, that features an on-card signature in gold ink by Ohtani and the MLB logo patch from the pants he wore during his record-setting game against the Miami Marlins, was sold by Heritage Auctions on Saturday night for US$1,067,500. The name of the buyer has not been revealed.
That is by far the most money paid in a public auction for an Ohtani card. The previous record was the US$533,140 paid last year for a card from the 2018 Bowman Chrome Rookie Autographs Orange Refractor set. While 25 of those cards exist, that one received a 10 from the Beckett Grading Service.
The record-setting card is one of three different cards from the 50-50 game that Topps used to launch its Dynasty Black series, which features single autographed cards with pieces of game-used memorabilia from specific, historic moments.
One of those Ohtani 50-50 cards – which includes a tag from the batting gloves Ohtani wore while hitting his 50th home run and a laundry tag from the pants he wore during that game – received US$173,240 at auction in February.
“Shohei Ohtani is currently the best player in the game, and this one-of-one card is tied to a significant historical moment as the first MLB player to join the 50-50 club in 2024,” Chris Ivy, director of sports auctions at Heritage, said. “It is also the most desirable of the three one-of-one Dynasty black cards because of the logo patch.”"

Intel needed to replace the engineering talent it had lost, improve its balance sheet and better attune manufacturing processes to meet the needs of potential customers, Tan said. Speaking at his first public appearance as CEO, at the Intel Vision conference Monday in Las Vegas, Tan did not specify what parts of Intel he believed were no longer central to its future.
“We have a lot of hard work ahead,” Tan said, addressing the company’s customers in the audience. “There are areas where we’ve fallen short of your expectations.”
The veteran semiconductor executive is trying to restore the fortunes of a company that dominated an industry for decades, but now finds itself chasing rivals in most of the areas that define success in the field. A key question confronting its leadership is whether a turnaround is best served by the company remaining whole or splitting up its key product and manufacturing operations.
Tan gave no indication that he would seek to divest either part of Intel. Instead, he highlighted the problems he needed to fix to get both units performing more successfully. Intel’s chips for data centre and artificial intelligence (AI)-related work in particular were not good enough, he said.
“We fell behind on innovation,” the CEO said. “We have been too slow to adapt and meet your needs.”"

Putting pressure on OpenAI, many large companies and governments have proved reluctant to build their AI products or services on models they have no control over, especially when data security is a concern.
