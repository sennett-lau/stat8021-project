The retailer’s Hong Kong app has also been suspended.A Marks & Spencer Food Store in Wan Chai, Hong Kong. File photo: Wikimedia Commons. “We are currently experiencing some technical issues, some systems are offline in a small number of stores, including the M&S HK app,” a spokesperson told HKFP by email on Wednesday. “We are working hard to restore normal services as swiftly as possible, and we apologise for any disruption [to] our customers.”M&S UK is reportedly being targeted by a ransomware gang that steals confidential data and scrambles it in the hope of extorting a ransom. According to the BBC, a loosely run group called Scattered Spider is using malicious software from a gang called DragonForce. Hong Kong stores are operated by franchisee Al Futtaim. It is unclear how directly local systems are affected by the UK turmoil.A staffer at the Kennedy Town branch told HKFP on Tuesday that their computer system had been down since Sunday. When HKFP visited the store, staff were using pen and paper to note down order and loyalty card details.Those who log into the app are greeted with an “under maintenance” notice. The cyberattack has affected supply chains in the UK, leading to empty shelves at some British stores. The retailer said it hoped the issue would be resolved by the end of the week.The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data told HKFP that M&S Hong Kong had not reported an incident to them, but it would contact them.

HKFP,Hong Kong trans activist launches new legal challenge over ID card gender policy,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/30/hong-kong-trans-activist-launches-new-legal-challenge-over-id-card-gender-policy/,"07:57, 30 April 2025","A Hong Kong activist behind a landmark lawsuit allowing trans people to be issued ID cards matching their gender identity has launched another legal challenge over the new requirements.Henry Tse outside the Court of Final Appeal on Feb. 6, 2023. Photo: Hillary Leung/HKFP.In a writ seen by HKFP, Henry Tse’s lawyers submitted that the Immigration Department’s new policy still requiring “partial” gender-affirming surgery and ongoing hormone treatments was still unlawful.The activist is also seeking to challenge the government’s lack of a legal framework recognising transgender people. In April last year, the government revised rules to make it easier for trans people to amend their ID cards to reflect their gender identity, more than a year after the Court of Final Appeal ruled in a landmark decision that Hong Kong’s rules on changing gender on identity documents were unconstitutional.The judicial review brought by Tse two years ago challenged the government’s policy barring trans people who had not undergone full surgery from applying to change the gender stated on their ID cards.‘Arbitrary’ requirementsHong Kong’s trans community generally sees the updated policy only as a partial victory, given that it still requires trans applicants to complete surgeries to alter sexual characteristics, namely removing the breasts or the penis and testes.According to Tse’s judicial review application filed on Friday, it is unconstitutional to impose such requirements on trans people who have not received those gender-affirming surgeries.Tse’s lawyers also argued that the government had set down different and, therefore, discriminatory surgery requirements for trans men and trans women “without any reference or consideration as to the function of such organs.”The Court of Final Appeal. File photo: GovHK. They said that the top court had “expressly agreed… that it is rare that a person’s genitals would be exposed and that most transgender persons would go to great lengths to avoid being placed in a position where they need to expose such areas.”They further argued that the requirement for trans women to effectively undergo sterilisation – a significantly more intrusive procedure compared with the mastectomy required of trans men – amounted to discrimination under the Sex Discrimination Ordinance.The activist is also challenging requirements that trans people declare they will submit medical reports certifying hormone levels within 30 days of a request from authorities and consent to the sharing of blood test reports with the government.The slew of requirements amounts to a violation of the constitutional right to privacy under Hong Kong’s Bill of Rights Ordinance, a core tenet cited by the five top court judges who delivered the landmark ruling two years ago, he argued.The Court of Final Appeal said in February 2023 that any incongruities between a trans person’s outward appearance and their identity card could elicit doubt and questions involving a “violation of dignity and invasion of privacy.”Immigration Department. File photo: GovHK.In a similar vein, Tse’s lawyers argued that the updated policy still amounted to an intrusion upon his private life.The policy would allow authorities to request Tse’s medical reports arbitrarily for the rest of his life, “without any reasonable restrictions, without any safeguards and over an indefinite period of time,” they said. Tse would be unable to foresee the circumstances under which he would be asked to provide a report, “the results upon which may lead to potential criminal sanction,” they added.“Such random ‘spot checks’ without any reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed, cannot be ‘in accordance with the law’ and each spot check amounts to a significant intrusion into his private life,” the lawyers argued.They also submitted that the medical report requirement had no legitimate aim, saying that Tse’s hormone level was one of the most inconsequential factors “in a basket of others,” such as whether he was living and being accepted as a man in society.According to the Immigration Department, the gender marker on a Hong Kong ID card only serves as an “identifier” and “does not represent change of the holder’s sex as a matter of law.”Tse is also seeking to challenge the absence of a framework that would legally recognise him as a man, the lack of which would deprive him of family and marriage rights.Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | AppsHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team LATEST FROM HKFP China lifts sanctions against five Euro deputies – parliament Explainer: Hong Kong’s national security crackdown – month 58 Chinese business in Vietnam struggles with US tariffs uncertainty Chinese national arrested with surveillance device near Philippine election commission Support HKFP | Code of Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Annual & Transparency Report",James Lee,2025-04-30 07:57:00,HKFP

Photos: X.“The incident has resulted in 22 deaths and three injuries,” it added. Footage shared online and verified by AFP showed the inferno engulfing the two-storey restaurant and smoke billowing skyward.Other authenticated videos published on Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, showed paramedics wheeling one victim on a stretcher into an ambulance and several firefighters battling the flames with hoses.Another video from the social media platform shot from above the scene showed more than a dozen fire engines parked outside the restaurant.The operator of the restaurant was taken into police custody, state news agency Xinhua reported Tuesday evening.The report added that 22 firefighting vehicles and 85 firefighters had been dispatched to distinguish the blaze.Rescue efforts have now concluded, Xinhua said, adding that all injured victims were in “stable condition”.“The cause of the fire is currently under investigation,” it added.China’s Xi Jinping. Photo: Cambodia Gov’t.President Xi Jinping called for “every effort to treat the injured, properly handle the aftermath for the deceased and provide support to their families, swiftly determine the cause of the fire, and pursue accountability in accordance with the law,” according to CCTV.‘Very tragic’One woman working at a nearby restaurant said she hadn’t been outside all day and only learnt of the incident when she read news articles about the fire.“We weren’t aware of it and continued on normally,” she told AFP over the phone.The woman, who did not want to be identified, said she had “no idea” what caused the fire but said she heard sirens and there were still police outside of her restaurant. “It definitely was very tragic,” she added.Deadly fires are relatively common in China due to lax building codes and an often slipshod approach to workplace safety.The country has seen a spate of such deadly incidents in recent months.This month, 20 people died in a fire at a nursing home in northern China’s Hebei province.And in January, a blaze at a vegetable market in Zhangjiakou city, northwest of Beijing, killed eight people and injured 15.A month before that, nine people died in a fire at a construction site in eastern China’s Rongcheng city.Dateline:Beijing, China Type of Story: News ServiceProduced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic standards.Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | AppsHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team LATEST FROM HKFP China lifts sanctions against five Euro deputies – parliament Explainer: Hong Kong’s national security crackdown – month 58 Chinese business in Vietnam struggles with US tariffs uncertainty Chinese national arrested with surveillance device near Philippine election commission Support HKFP | Code of Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Annual & Transparency Report",AFP,2025-04-29 19:21:00,HKFP

The four face a total of 12 counts of collecting money in a public place without a permit and displaying bills or posters on government land without permission.Their offences are in relation to street booths they held in Causeway Bay and Wan Chai on three days in 2023: April 2, April 30, and May 28. The trial began with the prosecution, led by barrister Timmy Yip, presenting their case. Yip summoned four police officers who observed the street booths on those three days as witnesses and asked them questions based on videos taken of the incidents.LSD chair Chan Po-ying at a street booth in Causeway Bay on May 28, 2023. Photo: League of Social Democrats, via Facebook. After that, Magistrate Minnie Wat asked Chan’s barrister, Anson Wong, if his client would testify and if he would call any witnesses. Wong said no to both questions.When Chau was asked if he would testify, he said no “because the truth is already very clear.” He also said he would not summon any witnesses.Yu and Lee echoed their co-defendants. Wat adjourned the case to Wednesday afternoon for the prosecution and the defence to give their closing submissions.Officers’ testimoniesThe four pro-democracy activists’ trial comes two years after they held the street booths, during which they displayed a blank black cloth banner and handed out publications with QR codes for donation links, according to the prosecution.Representing the prosecution, Yip played videos of three incidents during the examination-in-chief. The police officers, who acted as prosecution witnesses, testified that they recognised the people in the clips as the defendants on trial.Wong, Chan’s lawyer, asked the first two witnesses to confirm that the black cloth at the booths was indeed blank, and if it was therefore different from displays one might see at other public assemblies. The two witnesses agreed.After the lawyers finished questioning each witness, the activists representing themselves also posed questions to the officers. Lee, the only defendant who is not an LSD member, confirmed with the first three witnesses that they did not hear the activists urging people to donate money and did not see anybody giving money. They agreed.League of Social Democrats activists outside the Eastern Magistrates’ Court on April 29, 2025. Photo: Hillary Leung/HKFP.Chau asked the third witness whether the reason police officers filmed the street booth on May 28, 2023, extensively was because the activists had mentioned June 4 – the date of the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989. The witness said he disagreed.When Chau questioned what the police’s aim was in filming the street booth, Yip said he believed it went beyond the scope of the testimony.QR codesThe fourth witness, a police officer who happened to be handed publications by the activists on the three dates of the street booths, told the court that she brought the publications back to the police headquarters, where she scanned the two QR codes printed on them.The QR codes directed users to donate to them via Paypal’s Braintree and HSBC’s PayMe, she said. The prosecution presented pages of screenshots, made by the officer surnamed Choi, showing the steps of how payment can be made. Choi told Chan’s lawyer, Wong, that she did not complete payments on either platform. She confirmed that she did not know if the payment would actually work.Eastern Magistrates’ Courts. File photo: Kelly Ho/HKFP.Chau asked Choi why she made 16 screenshots of Braintree, but only one of PayMe. Choi answered that she had made a screenshot for every step, and PayMe simply had fewer steps.The activist said that he believed Choi knew that payments through PayMe would not have worked because HSBC had already frozen LSD’s account, referring to the bank ending its relationship with the political party in 2023.The QR code was already ineffective, Chau also told the court. Meanwhile, Lee questioned why anyone would hand out publications with QR codes for a frozen bank account and ask people to donate money.When asked by Yu, Choi confirmed that she did not see any money boxes at their street booth or other ways in which funds could be collected. Six LSD members in the same case pleaded guilty in October and were fined up to HK$1,000.Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | AppsHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team LATEST FROM HKFP China lifts sanctions against five Euro deputies – parliament Explainer: Hong Kong’s national security crackdown – month 58 Chinese business in Vietnam struggles with US tariffs uncertainty Chinese national arrested with surveillance device near Philippine election commission Support HKFP | Code of Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Annual & Transparency Report",Hillary Leung,2025-04-29 19:02:00,HKFP

Photo: Torbjorn Toby Jorgensen, via Flickr.Dubbed “China Targets”, the fresh investigation involving 42 media organisations delves into the various tactics Beijing uses to silence critics beyond its borders. One segment of the probe published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) deals with China’s increasing offensive at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.In particular, it focuses on the growing presence at the council of pro-China, government-organised non-governmental organisations, referred to as “Gongos”.Such groups crowd into council sessions to praise China and present glowing accounts of its actions that are largely at odds with UN and expert findings of widespread rights violations and repression.A bombshell report published by former UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet in 2022 for instance cited possible “crimes against humanity” against China’s Uyghur minority in the western Xinjiang region.Other reports have highlighted the separation of Tibetan children from their families and the targeting of democracy activists in Hong Kong.National flags of China and HKSAR flags in Hong Kong. File photo: GovHK. But when legitimate NGOs raise such issues at the council, Gongos often strive to disrupt the session and drown out their testimonies, the ICIJ said.‘Corrosive’An ICIJ analysis of 106 NGOs from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan registered with the UN found that 59 had close links to the government in Beijing or the Chinese Communist Party.During a regular review of China’s rights record before the council last year, attended by AFP, more than half of the NGOs granted a speaking slot were pro-government groups.“It’s corrosive. It’s dishonest,” Michele Taylor, who served as US ambassador to the Human Rights Council from 2022 until January this year, was quoted as saying in the report.She decried a broader effort by Beijing “to obfuscate their own human rights violations and reshape the narrative”.Michele Taylor. File photo: U.S. Ambassador to the Human Rights Council, via X. Increasingly, the Beijing-controlled groups are also used to monitor and intimidate those planning to testify about alleged abuses, the investigation found.The ICIJ and its partners said they spoke with 15 activists and lawyers focused on rights issues in China who “described being surveilled or harassed by people suspected to be proxies for the Chinese government”.Such incidents occurred both inside the UN and elsewhere in Geneva.‘We’re watching’The report highlighted how a group of Chinese activists and dissidents were so fearful of Beijing’s swelling presence at the council that they in March last year refused to set foot inside the UN buildings.“Instead, they gathered for a secret meeting on the top floor of a nondescript office building nearby” with UN rights chief Volker Turk, the report said.But suddenly, four people claiming to work with the Guangdong Human rights Association showed up asking about the meeting, to which they had not been invited.Staff from the International Service for Human Rights (ISHR) who were facilitating the meeting denied it was taking place.The four left, but later, when two Uyghur participants left the office for a smoke, they reported that someone in a black car with tinted windows photographed them before people matching the description of the Guangdong group got into the vehicle and it pulled away. Zumretay Arkin. File photo: Zumretay Arkin, via X. Zumretay Arkin, vice president of the World Uyghur Congress, told ICIJ she believed the Guangdong group was sending a message from Beijing: “We’re watching you… You can’t escape us.”‘Deadly reprisal’The activists had reason to be fearful.Over a decade ago, activist Cao Shunli was detained as she attempted to travel to Geneva ahead of a China rights record review at the UN.After being held for several months without charge, she fell gravely ill and died on March 14, 2014.ICIJ said her death “stood out as a powerful warning shot”, determining that the “deadly reprisal” had discouraged other activists from engaging with the UN.A decade later, Chinese rights defenders are participating in UN activities at record low numbers, the investigation found.At the same time, the number of Chinese NGOs registered with the UN has nearly doubled since 2018, it said.Dateline:Geneva, Switzerland Type of Story: News ServiceProduced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic standards.Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | AppsHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team LATEST FROM HKFP China lifts sanctions against five Euro deputies – parliament Explainer: Hong Kong’s national security crackdown – month 58 Chinese business in Vietnam struggles with US tariffs uncertainty Chinese national arrested with surveillance device near Philippine election commission Support HKFP | Code of Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Annual & Transparency Report",AFP,2025-04-29 15:51:00,HKFP

File Photo: GovHK.Ju’s sculpture “Lining Up” featured 10 figures standing in a line. Some wore black suits, two were in yellow raincoats, and one woman stood in pink holding a yellow umbrella. It was installed outside the Hong Kong Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui in 2017.The artwork was removed in June after being covered by hoarding boards, sparking censorship concerns online. The government said at the time the piece was “under repair.” Locally, yellow is associated with pro-democracy movements, particularly yellow umbrellas. During the 2019 protests and unrest, a demonstrator wearing a yellow raincoat died after falling from a platform outside a mall – yellow raincoats subsequently became a protest symbol.

A few steps away, figures of Xi Yang Yang and Le Rong Rong, mascots for the upcoming National Games and other sports events, stood on display.In response to HKFP’s enquiries, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) said that “the restoration has been completed” and that the artwork “is now in [the] LCSD’s collection storage.”It also said: “As the sculpture concerned had been on display at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre Piazza (the Piazza) for many years since 2017, it would not be reinstalled in situ.”The LCSD did not reply to HKFP’s question of whether the artwork would be displayed elsewhere.Xi Yang Yang and Le Rong Rong, mascots for the National Games, outside the Hong Kong Cultural Centre on April 28, 2025.

The LCSD hosted an exhibition of artworks from the series at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre in 2014 – three years before Lining Up was displayed outside the centre.In a Facebook post published in 2017, the Art Promotion Office under the LCSD invited members of the public to take photos with the artwork. “Painted with vibrant colours, ten figures with different poses, clothes and body shapes are lining up casually… the queuing figures are expressively sculpted to large blocks with rough edges, which present a vivid depiction of people’s contemporary life,” the post read. “Among the figures, the one who wears a cap is actually the representation of Ju Ming himself!”Hoarding boards placed around “Lining Up” outside the Hong Kong Cultural Centre on June 20, 2024.

Her husband, Philip Bowring, confirmed with reporters that Mo was inside the flat and resting, adding she was “well and in good spirits.”Inside the living room of Mo’s home, there was a banner, reading: “Welcome Home Mum.” The four pro-democracy figures were sentenced to four years and two months in jail after pleading guilty to the charge of conspiracy to commit subversion.Their release came after the court deducted from the sentences the time they had spent in detention since late February 2021, when their police bail was revoked. After being formally brought to court in March that year, the court refused to grant them bail pending trial on national security grounds.The four were among the defendants who received the shortest prison terms. The longest jail sentence – 10 years – was given to former law professor Benny Tai, who was described as the “mastermind” behind the election plan by three handpicked national security judges presiding over the case.Shek Pik Prison in the early hours of April 29, 2025.

Part I – Primary election organisers, ex-district councillors The high-profile case centred on an unofficial primary election held in July 2020 that aimed to help the pro-democracy camp win a controlling majority in the legislature.The judges ruled that the democrats had planned to use their constitutional powers to veto the government budget, ultimately forcing the resignation of the chief executive and a government shutdown. This, they ruled, would have resulted in a “constitutional crisis.”See also: Who are the 45 Hong Kong pro-democracy figures jailed for subversion? Part II – Activists, ex-lawmakersIn the judges’ reasoning for the sentences, Mo, Fan, Tam, and Kwok were given a one-third reduction in jail time for their guilty plea, along with a further three-month discount for their past public service and “ignorance of the law.”Beijing inserted national security legislation directly into Hong Kong’s mini-constitution in June 2020 following a year of pro-democracy protests and unrest. It criminalised subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces and terrorist acts – broadly defined to include disruption to transport and other infrastructure. The move gave police sweeping new powers and led to hundreds of arrests amid new legal precedents, while dozens of civil society groups disappeared. The authorities say it restored stability and peace to the city, rejecting criticism from trade partners, the UN and NGOs.Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | AppsHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team LATEST FROM HKFP China lifts sanctions against five Euro deputies – parliament Explainer: Hong Kong’s national security crackdown – month 58 Chinese business in Vietnam struggles with US tariffs uncertainty Chinese national arrested with surveillance device near Philippine election commission Support HKFP | Code of Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Annual & Transparency Report",Kelly Ho,2025-04-29 07:40:00,HKFP

The prosecution dropped a previous charge of “gross indecency by man with male mentally incapacitated person.” Chung was previously accused of sexually assaulting a man with an intellectual disability, identified as X, on August 3.Magistrate Kenneth Chan of the Fanling Magistrates’ Courts ordered the case to be adjourned to June 5 at the Eastern Magistrates’ Court.Chan also issued an anonymity order to protect the identity of the alleged female victim, Y, from being disclosed, including by the media.Chung, who did not apply for bail, has been remanded in custody pending his next court appearance.The former warden last appeared in court in November, months after the alleged assaults took place.Fanling Law Courts Building.

The Hong Chi Association, which runs the care home, issued a statement in October, saying that it had fired an employee over a “serious breach of the Association’s code of conduct” and that an independent review committee had been appointed to examine protective measures in its facilities.Chief Executive John Lee said in October that the alleged crime was “despicable and shameless” and that the Social Welfare Department must ensure care homes in the city operate under effective supervision.According to the Hong Chi Association, the Pinehill Integrated Vocational Training Centre serves adults with mild and moderate intellectual disabilities, as well as offering residential services.💡If you are suffering from sexual or domestic violence, regardless of your age or gender, contact the police, Harmony House (click for details) and/or the Social Welfare Department on 28948896.

Photo: Kyle Lam/HKFP.David Lam, chairperson of the Panel on Health Services in the Legislative Council (LegCo), said on an RTHK programme on Monday that cases from other places around the world showed stricter anti-smoking policies would not have any impact on tourism after a period of adjustment.“Think about a metropolitan city. When you present yourself to brands around the world, is it better to be seen as a smoking hub or a healthy hub?” Lam said in Cantonese. “I think a healthy hub is better.” Lam said he supported the proposed legislative amendments, but he considered it “a bit too slow” for some measures to take full effect in 2027.The government unveiled the Tobacco Control Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2025 last week, which includes plans to ban alternative smoking products in public like e-cigarettes, prohibit the sale of tobacco products with added flavours, and expand statutory non-smoking areas.E-cigarette device. Photo: Pixabay.Lam, who is also a physician, shared his main concern about tobacco products with added flavourings. These flavourings mask the unpleasant smell of traditional tobacco, potentially attracting non-smokers to try them, he said.“The government has no plan to outlaw products with menthol for now, which is rather disappointing because we know that menthol attracts a lot of people and is a flavour that many people use,” Lam said in Cantonese.In Hong Kong, 73 per cent of young smokers and 63 per cent of female smokers smoke menthol cigarettes, the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health said in a report released in October.According to the bill, the government plans to ban the sale of flavoured smoking products in phases. The first phase will target products with specified additives, excluding menthol. Full implementation is expected to take place in the second quarter of 2027.The bill is set to be tabled at the Legislative Council on Wednesday.A man smoking with heated tobacco devices in Hong Kong. Photo: Kyle Lam/HKFP. Eddie Lee, deputy secretary for health, said on the same RTHK programme that the bill was drafted after the government outlined its smoking control goals last year, following a public consultation in 2023.The programme host asked why the government chose not to tackle the sales of menthol tobacco products first, given their majority market share. Lee replied that various flavours that have gained popularity among young people in recent years were non-menthol, and their fruity flavours often led people to think they were less harmful.“This is why we think we should tackle the new flavours first,” he said. “Smoking control is a step-by-step, multi-pronged [process].”Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | AppsHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team LATEST FROM HKFP China lifts sanctions against five Euro deputies – parliament Explainer: Hong Kong’s national security crackdown – month 58 Chinese business in Vietnam struggles with US tariffs uncertainty Chinese national arrested with surveillance device near Philippine election commission Support HKFP | Code of Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Annual & Transparency Report",Kelly Ho,2025-04-28 19:18:00,HKFP

Photo: The Hong Kong Women Workers’ Association.Around 15 members of the Hong Kong Women Workers’ Association (HKWWA) unfurled a banner and held signs outside the Central Government Offices (CGO) on Sunday, ahead of the annual Labour Day on May 1. The banner read: “There are many defects in labour protection” and “Government policies are not the right fit.” A government representative later met the group outside the CGO complex to receive their petition.The group said in a statement that the government’s two-year expanded labour import scheme, which was launched in September 2023, had caused employers to lose interest in improving working conditions.“Currently, the easy importation of non-local labour means that local employers have no motivation to improve conditions to attract workers, raise wages, or enhance occupational health and safety,” the Chinese-language statement read.The Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme allows Hong Kong employers to bring in non-local workers for 26 types of jobs that were previously only open to local residents – including cashiers, hair stylists, sales assistants, and waiters – as well as unskilled or low-skilled posts such as cleaners, dishwashers, and security guards.Government contractors clean a wet market. File photo: GovHK. Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun told the Legislative Council on April 16 that the government had approved a total of 54,278 non-local workers – mostly from mainland China – between September 2023 and March 2025. Among them, 8,971 people took up positions as waiters and waitresses, followed by 6,172 individuals hired as junior cooks.The HKWWA said on Sunday that it was “ironic” that Hong Kong allowed more non-local workers to take up jobs in the food and beverage and retail sectors amid the industries’ downturn.Some cleaners were dismissed due to their age in recent years, while around 2,500 workers were imported from elsewhere for this role, they added. They urged the government to formulate policies to better protect local low-skilled labour, saying such workers have “low bargaining power” because they are seen as easily replaceable.On Thursday, a catering labour union asked the government to establish a mechanism to halt the labour import scheme after finding that more than 200 local employees reported being replaced by imported workers. The HKWWA also called on the government to consider adopting a living wage of HK$61.50 per hour, instead of a minimum wage, because the latter does not reflect a “reasonable return” for workers.Hong Kong is set to raise the statutory hourly minimum wage from HK$40 to HK$42.10 in May. However, the new minimum wage still fails to “uphold workers’ dignity” in their daily lives, the group said, pointing out that it would only lead to a monthly wage of HK$10,158, assuming the minimum wage worker works full-time.The government should re-evaluate the minimum pay calculation mechanism, so that workers can keep up with inflation and ensure their income is higher than that of those who receive Comprehensive Social Security Assistance, the HKWWA said.Implementing a living wage, which is calculated based on the cost of living in Hong Kong, can allow workers to support themselves and one non-working family member, the group said. Workers “can afford a balanced diet, maintain a social life, and save for unexpected events,” the HKWWA said.Hong Kong first introduced the statutory minimum wage in 2011. It was last adjusted in 2023 after a four-year freeze.Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | AppsHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team LATEST FROM HKFP China lifts sanctions against five Euro deputies – parliament Explainer: Hong Kong’s national security crackdown – month 58 Chinese business in Vietnam struggles with US tariffs uncertainty Chinese national arrested with surveillance device near Philippine election commission Support HKFP | Code of Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Annual & Transparency Report",Kelly Ho,2025-04-28 14:07:00,HKFP

Chinese coast guard spokesperson Liu Dejun said in a statement Sunday evening that six personnel from the Philippines had earlier that day “illegally boarded” the Tiexian Reef, also known as Sandy Cay, despite “warnings and dissuasion” from the Chinese side.Liu said that Chinese coast guard personnel then “boarded the reef and investigated and dealt with it in accordance with the law”.The statement did not provide further details on the encounter or the identities of the six people from the Philippines.“We urge the Philippines to immediately stop its infringement,” Liu said, adding that the actions “violated China’s territorial sovereignty”.The sandbank, part of the Spratly Islands, lies near Thitu Island, also called Pag-asa and the site of a Philippine military facility.Members of Philippine maritime law enforcement agencies display a Philippine flag on a disputed reef on April 27, 2025.

On Monday, the Philippine and US militaries launched three weeks of annual joint exercises called “Balikatan”, or “shoulder to shoulder”, which will include an integrated air and missile defence simulation for the first time.US Marine Corps Lieutenant General James Glynn said at the opening ceremony in Manila that the two sides would “demonstrate not just our will to uphold our mutual defence treaty in existence since 1951 but our matchless capability to do so”.“Nothing builds bonds more quickly than shared adversity,” he said, without specifying a common threat.Beijing said the manoeuvres “undermine regional strategic stability” and accused Manila of “collusion with countries outside the region”.Dateline:Beijing, China Type of Story: News ServiceProduced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic standards.Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | AppsHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team LATEST FROM HKFP China lifts sanctions against five Euro deputies – parliament Explainer: Hong Kong’s national security crackdown – month 58 Chinese business in Vietnam struggles with US tariffs uncertainty Chinese national arrested with surveillance device near Philippine election commission Support HKFP | Code of Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Annual & Transparency Report",AFP,2025-04-28 11:37:00,HKFP

As a primary school teacher in Hong Kong, she is surrounded by children five days a week. They excite her most days and wear her out on others – but still, she dreams of having her own to come home to.Jennifer and Anna in their living room in March 2025. Photo: Kyle Lam/HKFP.“I love their energy. I love being around them, and I love their honesty and the challenge,” she said. But being a lesbian, Jennifer didn’t think too much about when – and how – to have children. 💡HKFP grants anonymity to known sources under tightly controlled, limited circumstances defined in our Ethics Code. Among the reasons senior editors may approve the use of anonymity for sources are threats to safety, job security or fears of reprisals.In Hong Kong, where marriage equality is not recognised, Jennifer and her wife, Anna, have limited options for parenthood. The pair, along with other same-sex couples interviewed by HKFP, asked to use pseudonyms due to privacy concerns.Whether pursuing assisted reproduction treatments like In-Vitro Fertilisation (IVF), surrogacy or adoption, all of the couples said they had to jump through hoops due to Hong Kong’s strict reproductive laws.Assisted reproduction treatments in Hong Kong are restricted to people who are heterosexual and married.An ultrasound image of Jennifer and Anna’s baby. Photo: Kyle Lam/HKFP.Commercial surrogacy – often the only option for gay couples – and reproductive treatments involving buying a gamete or embryo are illegal, even if done abroad.The regulations are a rare case of Hong Kong laws governing acts committed overseas.Authorities say the laws safeguard children and the status of families. The ban on commercial dealings is “in line with the universal principle” of prohibiting human organ and tissue trading, as well as protecting vulnerable women from exploitation, they say.But some voices say the lack of accessible, legal options discourages same-sex couples from pursuing parenthood.“Hong Kong’s reproductive laws create a challenging environment for same-sex couples seeking to build families, particularly male couples,” Mark Daly, a human rights lawyer, told HKFP.Elsewhere in Asia, reproductive laws are similarly restrictive. While Taiwan legalised same-sex marriage in 2019, same-sex couples still cannot do IVF. It is also illegal in other countries such as Singapore and Malaysia.Anna’s belly at 22 weeks pregnant. Photo: Kyle Lam/HKFP.Jennifer and Anna – who are in their mid- to late-30s – did IVF in the UK, where it is legal for same-sex couples. After three failed embryo transfers, Anna finally became pregnant in October.Sitting in their home in March, Jennifer and Anna told HKFP they were privileged to afford the procedures, which they estimated cost around HK$600,000 to HK$800,000.Still, the constant travel took an emotional toll on them. They wish they could have done IVF in Hong Kong, just like heterosexual couples. “We’ve got this dropping birth rate. The government is trying super hard for people to have kids,” she said. “Why don’t they allow gay people to have kids?” she said.Legal grey areasSame-sex couples in Hong Kong have limited legal rights. Some they enjoy – such as housing and inheritance rights – are a result of court challenges by LGBTQ activists. In September 2023, the Court of Final Appeal delivered a landmark ruling that Hong Kong must enact a framework for recognising same-sex relationships. The government is expected to deliver the framework by October.The Court of Final Appeal. Photo: Kelly Ho/HKFP. Despite the legal victories, conservative voices remain. Lawmakers have argued that a husband and wife provide “more adequate support” to families and can reduce “incidences of psychological problems and behavioural deviations.”Still, some same-sex couples in Hong Kong are pursuing their parenthood dreams. HKFP spoke with half a dozen same-sex couples expecting a child or raising children in the city. The lesbian couples did IVF overseas, with one partner carrying the baby and giving birth – or planning to give birth – here.Two of the gay couples’ children were carried by a partner’s female relative in an altruistic surrogacy arrangement. The other children were born through commercial surrogacy outside Hong Kong, including in the US and mainland China.Surrogacy routesFor Daniel and John, the topic of children came up shortly after meeting on a dating app in 2018.

Their son, Liam, was delivered via commercial surrogacy in mainland China – where it is illegal – last year. All the children’s names in this story are pseudonyms.Three women were involved in the surrogacy, carried out in China’s Guangdong province: the woman whose egg they bought, the surrogate, and the woman whose name appeared on their child’s birth certificate.The legal and administrative nightmare came after Liam was born, with endless paperwork and appointments to secure identity documents so he could come to Hong Kong.“It was very stressful, the uncertainty of ‘What if I can’t get him out, and how long is this going to take?'” Daniel, who is Canadian, told HKFP.Daniel finally brought Liam to Hong Kong when he was around a month old.Daniel and John with their children, Liam and Mia, at their home in March 2025. Photo: Kyle Lam/HKFP.Liam was joined by Mia, their daughter born through altruistic surrogacy last year in Canada, where the procedure is legal. Daniel’s sister bore the baby, conceived with her egg and John’s sperm.“My sister offered [to carry the baby]. It was her gift to us,” Daniel said.Both Daniel and John are listed as fathers on Mia’s birth certificate. The couple also obtained a court order in Canada certifying that they are her parents.Family lawyer Azan Marwah said that, given Hong Kong’s complicated reproductive laws, same-sex couples should seek legal advice to avoid consequences.After a baby is born abroad via surrogacy, the couple may encounter scrutiny at the Hong Kong airport when bringing them back, Marwah told HKFP. They could also face questions from the Immigration Department when applying for permanent residency or visas for their child.Daniel reads to his daughter, Mia, at home in March 2025. Photo: Kyle Lam/HKFP.But Marwah added that there had been no known prosecutions under the Human Reproductive Technology Ordinance, largely because of a limited prosecution window. As the ordinance’s offences are summary offences, authorities have only six months to prosecute, he said. For surrogacies, that window might start from the last payment that the couple made to an agency.In response to HKFP, police said they “do not maintain the requested figures” when asked how many prosecutions there had been under the ordinance.Adoption success storySome couples have sought another route: adoption.After years of waiting and uncertainty, Mark and Peter adopted four-year-old Lucas in February. The boy joins their five-year-old daughter, Emma, who was born out of an altruistic surrogacy arrangement, with Mark’s sister carrying their baby in the UK.Lucas hugging his adoptive father Mark at a park in March 2025. Photo: Kyle Lam/HKFP.They are a rare case of same-sex couples adopting in Hong Kong.In Hong Kong, same-sex married couples cannot apply for adoption as a joint applicant because their marriage is not recognised. They can only apply as a solo applicant, and their partners would be interviewed by social workers per the standard procedures which review everybody that would be involved in childcare.Mark, who is from the United Kingdom, applied as a solo applicant in 2020. During a social worker’s interviews with Mark and his husband Peter, who is from mainland China, the fact that they were a same-sex couple came up “extensively.”“Obviously, Lucas is different from most of his friends because he’s got two dads,” Mark said. “They were probing us a lot on how we would deal with that and the impact it may have on him.”Mark passed the application and was added to the prospective parents pool in 2021. Three years later, in 2024, they received a call that he was matched with a boy at a foster home.After a six-month placement during which Lucas lived in Mark and Peter’s home, the couple was granted an adoption order by the Family Court. When delivering the order, the judge acknowledged Peter by name and “recognised verbally that he was a parent,” Mark said.Mark’s and Peter’s wedding rings. Photo: Kyle Lam/HKFP.“That was a nice gesture that the judge made. Obviously, his name is not physically on the piece of paper… but it’s quite important he was recognised,” Mark added.‘Traditional family values’According to the Social Welfare Department (SWD), there were 102 applicants in the adoptive parents pool waiting to be matched with a child as of late February. Among them, 13 were solo applicants and 89 were joint applicants.Data from the past 10 years showed that joint applicants outnumbered solo applicants by almost five times. The percentage of joint applicants matched yearly was also higher than that of solo applicants.But it cannot be said that solo applicants face discrimination, said Diana Kwok, an associate professor at the Education University of Hong Kong’s Department of Special Education and Counselling.Mark and Peter in a park with their children, Emma and Lucas, in March 2025. Photo: Kyle Lam/HKFP.The wait time depends on the criteria that prospective parents select, she said.“Some applicants may specify wanting a newborn, or not having health complications, or a certain sex,” she told HKFP in Cantonese.Many same-sex couples are not aware they can adopt as solo applicants because adoption programmes tend to focus on traditional families, Kwok said. “Most of the time, the Social Welfare Department and the NGOs [that handle adoption] hold talks only targeting [married heterosexual] couples.”This reflects society’s view that families should consist of a husband and a wife, the professor added.Lawmaker Doreen Kong. FIle photo: Kyle Lam/HKFP.A 2019 Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) survey – the latest publicly available poll – found that almost 40 per cent of respondents thought same-sex married couples should not be allowed to adopt children, while over 53 per cent supported the idea. Independent lawmaker Doreen Kong said she could understand the opposition. The idea of same-sex parents raising children contradicts “traditional family values” in Chinese society, she said. “There might be less controversy about whether they should have financial or inheritance rights. But for raising a child, I think the views are much more divided,” she said in Cantonese.Preparing for motherhoodJennifer and Anna said they had not been treated differently from straight couples at doctor’s appointments. Jennifer said she had been able to accompany Anna for check-ups at their private clinics ahead of the July due date.“We’ve been very accepted throughout the process,” Anna, now in her last trimester, said. “I’ve never felt out of place, except sometimes in the waiting room where [there are] 10 straight couples… and then there’s us.”Secondhand baby clothes passed on by friends to Jennifer and Anna. Photo: Kyle Lam/HKFP.The couple is aware that Hong Kong, by default, acknowledges a child’s biological mother and father as the legal parents, meaning only Anna would be recognised. They said they would apply for Jennifer to be a guardian.It is rare for same-sex couples to seek parental rights through the court because of the time and money needed, Marwah said. There is also uncertainty about what options are available to them.Under the Parent and Child Ordinance, parental orders commonly sought after surrogacies are for “the husband and the wife” only.Guardianship orders could be possible, Marwah said. They do not exclude same-sex couples since guardians are regarded as anybody involved in caring for a child.In a widely reported 2021 ruling, a separated lesbian couple successfully asked the High Court to give guardianship to the non-birth mother and award them joint custody of their two children, who were conceived via artificial insemination.Jennifer and Anna’s home. Photo: Kyle Lam/HKFP.The verdict marked an important step for same-sex parents’ rights, but it is unclear if there have been other same-sex couples applying for guardianship orders.“It’s a relatively new area of law. Lawyers don’t really know or understand it,” Marwah said.For now, Jennifer and Anna are focused on the present. The couple have been up to their ears in research, attempting to understand everything from cribs to confinement nannies to wills and insurance plans.During a recent check-up, a doctor told the to-be parents that they were in for a “lifetime of stress.” Between the arduous IVF journey and navigating the law, they have already had a preview of what’s to come.“Just generally, there’s a lot to think about. I don’t feel like I’m ever going to feel prepared,” Jennifer said.Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | Apps Help safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our teamOriginal reporting on HKFP is backed by our monthly contributors.

HKFP,China hits out at 'extreme selfishness' of tariffs,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/27/china-hits-out-at-extreme-selfishness-of-tariffs/,"11:27, 27 April 2025","China’s foreign minister has hit out at the “extreme selfishness” of tariffs, hinting at the steep levies imposed on Beijing by US President Donald Trump.Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi. File photo: BRICS.“Certain countries” resort to “pressure and coercion, and trigger unjustified trade wars… This extreme selfishness only harms their credibility,” top diplomat Wang Yi told his Uzbek counterpart Bakhtiyor Saidov, according to a ministry statement released on Saturday.This will “only undermine their credibility”, added Wang, who was speaking on Friday on the sidelines of a foreign ministers’ meeting in Almaty, Kazakhstan. China and the United States, the world’s two biggest economies, are locked in an escalating tit-for-tat trade battle triggered by Trump’s levies on Chinese goods, which have reached 145 percent on many products.Beijing has responded with 125 percent tariffs of its own on US goods.US President Donald Trump on April 8, 2025, in the East Room of the White House. Photo: The White House, via Flickr.Also on Saturday, China repeated that it had held no talks with the United States on trade issues, despite Trump’s recent claim that he had taken a call from Chinese leader Xi Jinping.In an interview conducted on April 22 with Time magazine and published Friday, Trump did not say when the call with Xi took place or specify what was discussed.“He’s called,” Trump said. “And I don’t think that’s a sign of weakness on his behalf.”China’s commerce ministry had already denied on Thursday that Beijing and Washington were conducting economic or trade negotiations.In a statement posted on WeChat Saturday, Beijing’s embassy in the US capital repeated that assertion, saying “there have been no consultations or negotiations between China and the United States on tariff issues, let alone any agreement”.The statement did not mention Trump or Xi by name or directly reference Trump’s claim of a call, but said remarks by the United States that a dialogue on tariffs was ongoing were “nothing but misleading”. “This trade war was initiated by the US side,” the statement said.“If the US truly wants to resolve the issue through dialogue, it must first correct its mistakes, stop threatening and pressuring others, and completely remove all unilateral tariff measures against China.”The Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

HKFP,Easter exodus: More Hong Kong families head to mainland China for affordable fun,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/26/easter-exodus-more-hong-kong-families-head-to-mainland-china-for-affordable-fun/,"08:35, 26 April 2025","By Irene Chan & Hans TseHong Kong resident Chris Wong, his wife, and their kid travelled with two other families to Zhuhai on Easter Sunday. They crossed the border and checked into a resort hotel to spend the remaining two days of the Easter break in the Chinese city, just across the Pearl River Estuary from Hong Kong. A Hong Kong family takes this photo as they spend the Easter holiday in April 2025 in Shenzhen, China. Photo: Supplied.Wong and his family stayed in a room that cost HK$1,500 a night, which included tickets to two amusement parks at the 120,000-square-metre resort.“At the resort, Hongkongers are everywhere,” Wong told HKFP in Cantonese over the phone. “I can tell from their accent.”Along with his family, Wong – who is in his 30s – often spends weekends and holidays in Zhuhai and Shenzhen, two Chinese cities close to Hong Kong. He said heading to mainland China had become a popular choice for Hongkongers, especially families with children.“Half of my friends at work have gotten used to heading north to spend holidays,” said Wong, who works in the marketing sector.Two women push baby trolleys as they walk at a shopping mall in Shenzhen, in southern China’s Guangdong Province on April 14, 2025. Photo: Jade Gao/AFP.Since Hong Kong lifted its Covid-19 pandemic restrictions and reopened the border in February 2023, a growing number of residents have been travelling to neighbouring mainland Chinese cities for weekends and holidays. They spend on dining, shopping, and even medical services, taking advantage of the lower costs of goods and services.During the four-day Easter holiday last week, around 1.86 million Hong Kong residents left the city, with around 1.6 million heading to mainland China, according to the Immigration Department. Meanwhile, the number of travellers visiting Hong Kong over the Easter holiday only reached over half a million.The tourism deficit has left the city’s shopping malls and restaurants reeling.Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants & Related Trades, reckoned the city’s food and beverage industry suffered a 30 per cent drop in business during this year’s Easter holiday. Some high-end eateries experienced a 40 to 50 per cent drop in income during the holiday, he told a radio programme on Easter Monday, the last day of the holiday. The number of Hongkongers travelling to mainland China has steadily increased over the past few years.In 2024, Hong Kong residents made more than 104 million outbound trips, according to local media reports, citing official figures.Nearly 82 million trips were made to mainland China last year – a surge of more than 50 per cent compared with 2023, when Hong Kong recorded about 53 million trips across the border.‘A good deal’Hong Kong resident Luna – not her real name – goes to Shenzhen with her husband or friends at least once a month. It has been her habit for more than a year. 💡HKFP grants anonymity to known sources under tightly controlled, limited circumstances defined in our Ethics Code. Among the reasons senior editors may approve the use of anonymity for sources are threats to safety, job security or fears of reprisals.“We usually go for a massage or do our nails. Sometimes I have my haircut too. Then we eat at a restaurant,” said the 30-year-old, who asked to use a pseudonym due to privacy concerns.Dining in a hotpot restaurant in Shenzhen costs around HK$100 per person – a third of what she would spend in Hong Kong, she said.“Even if I don’t spend money in Shenzhen, I still won’t spend money in Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s restaurants are really too expensive,” said Luna, who works in marketing. An MTR advertisement promoting a family trip to Shenzhen, China, is shown at a metro station in Hong Kong. Photo: Kyle Lam/HKFP.“I think Hong Kong is still doing better in terms of food safety. But the price [of restaurants in mainland China] is such a good deal,” she added. “We’re just indulging every once in a while anyway.”She also sang the praises of the public facilities in mainland Chinese cities, saying they were better compared to years ago.“When I visited [mainland China] again after the pandemic ended, I found the hygiene had improved. Most toilets are now clean and odourless,” she said.During the Easter break last week, Luna and her husband hopped on the high-speed train to Shenzhen. “I think the railway also facilitates more people heading north. That’s why it was built, right?” she said.‘It’s crazy’In recent years, the Hong Kong government has been investing in infrastructure projects that connect the city with mainland China. In September 2018, the HK$85 billion high-speed rail link, connecting Hong Kong to 44 mainland Chinese cities, began operations. A month later, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, which cost over HK$117 billion, was opened.Hong Kong is also connected to Shenzhen via six land checkpoints: Shenzhen Bay, Lok Ma Chau, Lo Wu, Man Kam To, Sha Tau Kok, and Heung Yuen Wai.Carol, a mother of two toddlers, finds going across the border with young children is a hassle. But she still thinks it is worth it because Shenzhen has various attractions for kids.Many shopping malls in Shenzhen have large indoor playgrounds for children. “With HK$200 per person, the kids can spend a whole day there. While in Hong Kong, playrooms usually charge HK$200 per person for just an hour,” Carol, who also asked to use a pseudonym, said in Cantonese.Capybaras at a shopping mall in Shenzhen, China. Photo: Supplied. Peafowls in a shopping mall in Shenzhen, China. Photo: Supplied.“It’s crazy – now you can even see live animals like alpacas, peafowls and capybaras inside Shenzhen’s shopping malls. It’s a bit like animal farms in Hong Kong, but very clean,” she said, while admitting that having animals living in such a small space “is not very ethical.”Budget constraints are the main reason why she goes to mainland China, said Carol, who works in the social welfare sector.“If I had lots of money, I wouldn’t head north for entertainment,” she said. “But we are just ordinary families, and spending in mainland China is more affordable.”Reconciling outlookBefore she had a family, Carol used to visit Shenzhen once in a while. However, she stopped doing so in 2019, when the city was embroiled in massive protests and unrest, triggered by a now-axed extradition bill.The proposed legislation was seen as an instance of China’s encroachment upon Hong Kong. Thousands of protesters and activists have since been arrested and prosecuted.An advertisement for a dental clinic in Shenzhen, China, is shown on a double-decker bus in Hong Kong. Photo: Kyle Lam/HKFP.“I didn’t have a good feeling towards mainland China in 2019. Besides, I was participating in some of the protests, and I was worried that, if I crossed the border, I could be arrested,” she said.Luna said that, after the 2019 protests and unrest, many of her friends who had negative sentiments towards China had emigrated. Among those who still live in Hong Kong, only two still insisted on not crossing the border for holidays.“There are people who stay in the city for different kinds of reasons,” Luna said. With radical changes in the city’s political landscape, living in Hong Kong nowadays feels like “living in one of the provinces of China.”The departure hall in Hong Kong’s West Kowloon high-speed railway station. File photo: Kyle Lam/HKFP.Carol, in her 30s, has also reconciled her outlook. “We can’t do anything to improve the political situation even though we are staying in the city,” she said. “My focus in recent years has been more about my children. I just feel happy seeing that they are having fun.”Changing business landscape Although heading north is cheaper, Carol says, “We won’t go to Shenzhen every weekend. That’s too exhausting.”When they stay in Hong Kong, Carol usually brings her two toddlers to a playroom in Sha Tin, where she often sees crowds of people in restaurants and playrooms. She believes that Hong Kong still has its own attractions.Chris Wong, the young father, said he did not think the trend of Hongkongers going across the border would last forever.“People will just get tired of it after they’ve been to mainland cities many times,” he said. However, local businesses will have to withstand the pain in the short run, he added. Hong Kong authorities said last month that February retail sales logged a negative year-on-year change for the 12th straight month, dropping by 13 per cent compared with the same period last year.Wong believed that the downward trend would also impact Hong Kong’s food and beverage sector, but he said the change could be about “eliminating the weak and retaining the strong ones.”“Shenzhen restaurants charge a fair price and offer good service. Maybe Hong Kong restaurants could learn from them,” Wong said.Children play in Dino Park, a playground in Sha Tin, in April 2025.

Throughout this year, HKFP has been publicly disclosing and expanding its ethical policies, standards, reporting and corrections guidelines to adhere to the eight Trust Indicators. The move seeks to improve media literacy and battle “fake news,” misinformation and online propaganda.First adopted in March 2020, our newly-revamped guidelines lay out HKFP’s mission, our priorities, our expectations for staff conduct and impartiality, as well as how we deal with issues such as AI, advertising, anonymity, balance, security, sourcing and issues of race, religion, sexual orientation, disability and identity.We now join around 300 newsrooms across the world displaying the Trust Mark symbol, including the BBC, Washington Post, Sky News, CTV and the Economist. What is the Trust Project? Click to view.The Trust Project is an international consortium of news organisations building standards of transparency and working with technology platforms to affirm and amplify journalism’s commitment to transparency, accuracy, inclusion and fairness so that the public can make informed news choices. It was founded and is led by award-winning journalist Sally Lehrman. What are the 8 Trust Indicators?1. Best Practices – who is behind the news?If a journalist’s organization has rules they must follow to make sure their reporting is independent, accurate and honest, then their news will be more trustworthy. Does the site use guidelines to protect honest and independent reporting? What is the site’s mission and priorities? Who funds them?2. Journalist Expertise – who made this?We are rarely there to see events in the news for ourselves, so we rely on the journalist. They should follow strict standards for gathering solid evidence and multiple perspectives. Are the journalist(s) credentials easily available? Do they have a good professional reputation as a journalist? Are they reporting on a topic or community they know well?3. Labels – news, opinion, or what?It’s important to know whether your news is impartial or deliberately biased. Stories should be clearly labelled if they are designed to persuade us to agree. If it’s journalism, then it’s meant to help us develop our own opinions. Is the story impartial or does it have a clear opinion? Is it highly partisan, sponsored or advertising something? Is the purpose clearly shown?4. References – what are the sources?When a journalist is developing a news story, they may use information from eye witnesses, documents and other places – called sources. When a journalist shows their sources, we can check their reliability for ourselves. For investigative, in-depth or controversial stories, does the journalist provide sources for each claim? Do they give details so we can check the sources ourselves? Do other sources back up what is being said?5. Methods – why was it built?If we know why a journalist chose a particular story and how they reported it, it’s easier to interpret it. A journalist’s methods help us know how fast-moving, well-researched or impartial the story may be. How much reporting was done? What methods were used? Who else was involved in the process?6. Locally sourced – do they know you and your community?If a journalist knows and lives in the community, they can explain an event or issue more sensitively and accurately. If not, they can improve their reporting by going there and speaking to others who have local and community knowledge. Was the reporting done with deep knowledge about the local situation or community? Was the journalist on the scene? Did the journalist make an effort to listen to members of the community?7. Diverse voices – who is in the news, who is missing?If certain voices or experiences are missing from the news, we don’t get the full picture. Look for voices less commonly heard in society, often because of race, class, generation, gender, sexual orientation, ideology or the region they live in. Does the newsroom commit to bringing in diverse perspectives? Is there evidence that the journalist pays attention to diversity? Are some communities included only in stereotypical ways, or completely missing?8. Actionable feedback – does this news site listen to me?By inviting and listening to public feedback, journalists can make sure their work is accurate and complete. The public also might help them find important news they had overlooked. Does the news site invite the public to participate? Do they ask for feedback? Do they correct errors quickly, clearly and prominently?HKFP Policies, Ethics Code & Best Practices: Click to view our newly-revamped and expanded guidelines: Annual Report. Awards.

HKFP,Covid Children's Book,https://hongkongfp.com/2020/10/03/bobby-baboon-hkfp-launches-free-covid-19-childrens-story-book-in-english-and-chinese/,"13:20, 3 October 2020","2020 has been a traumatic and confusing year for the best of us, but the lasting impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on children is easily overlooked. As part of our public service mission, HKFP commissioned a bilingual, copyright-friendly children's book to help youngsters in Hong Kong - and beyond - understand what is happening. Bobby Baboon and the Invisible Buggies was illustrated by Kitty N. Wong, written by Kitty and Daniel Levia, and includes a foreword by Full Cup Therapy's Rachel Winston. When going through difficult times, parents often wonder and worry, “What will be the impact of this on my child? How can I stop them from being traumatised?” Kitty N. Wong sought to produce a simple child friendly book to help reduce the traumatic impact of the recent pandemic upon children. Together with the experienced teacher and author Daniel Levia, we set out to make this happen. While the personal impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will vary, there is a common thread we are all experiencing; uncertainty. When we feel uncertain for prolonged periods of time it can set off feelings of fear and helplessness. It is hard for us to stay grounded but if we are lucky we may have learnt our own strategies for coping from the past that we can now draw upon. With limited life experience, and brains that are still developing, children depend upon us (their network of safe people) to lean upon. You are your child’s most important resource! Two very useful strategies for building your child’s resilience are storytelling and fostering personal connection. Stories help children to make sense of their experiences and help them to recognise their own feelings, as well as the feelings of others. Feeling connected to our significant others is so important for regulating big emotions and having space to problem solve challenges in our daily lives. Snuggling up with your child to read this book ticks both of these resilience building boxes! “Bobby Baboon and the Invisible Buggies” is a heartfelt, hopeful and empowering story set in Asia. Bobby’s story aims to help your child make sense of the pandemic and of the many feelings that may have come up as a result. Bobby goes on an educational journey with Owl, releases his feelings and comes into a more empowered position. With the use of the reminder phrase PASS (Paws, Arms, Snouts & Spirits) helping your child to feel more empowered too. Lastly, Owl holds a hopeful picture of the future while acknowledging the current challenges and difficult emotions. May we all try to embody this wise owl and hold the space for our children’s emotions (however imperfectly). Of course this is not always possible and we too as adults need to seek out our own support systems at those times. Bobby’s story is an inspirational tale of how he was able to turn around his feelings of despair into hope. Through connection and with support he innovates new ways to play with and feel closer to his friends. We hope that this book provides an opportunity for emotional connection for your child, as well as acting as a springboard for you as parents to have meaningful and productive conversations about this health crisis.

Deviating from usual practice, the four democrats did not walk out of prison but left in private vehicles with curtains drawn before dawn, leaving them no opportunity to talk with the press.

Meanwhile, the Democratic Party, once the largest opposition party in the city’s legislature, moved closer to disbandment after its members approved the motion to mandate the central committee to proceed with disbanding procedures.Four democrats released from jailFour former pro-democracy lawmakers in Hong Kong have been released from prison after serving time for their involvement in an unofficial 2020 primary election. The four left the prisons in private vehicles without meeting any reporters awaiting outside the detention facilities. Claudia Mo, Gary Fan, Jeremy Tam, and Kwok Ka-ki were the first group of 45 democrats to be discharged from prison in the early morning of Tuesday after being sentenced in the city’s largest national security trial, which concluded in November.Mo was released from the Lo Wu Correctional Institution, while Fan left Lantau’s Shek Pik Prison. Tam and Kwok were discharged from Stanley Prison.(From left to right) Gary Fan, Claudia Mo, Kwok Ka-ki, Jeremy Tam. Photo: HKFP remix. According to an HKFP journalist at the scene, the police barred the media from waiting for Fan at the main entrance of Shek Pik Prison. Members of the press had to wait on a bridge near Shek Pik Reservoir, overlooking the facility.At 5.39am, a seven-seater vehicle left the prison, followed shortly by another private vehicle and a taxi. The private vehicles had curtains, with Fan believed to be in one of them. The other three democrats left their respective detention facilities in the early hours of Tuesday under similar arrangements, according to local media reports.The Correctional Services Department (CSD) defended the use of private vehicles for the release. In response to HKFP’s email, the department said on Tuesday that it would “make appropriate arrangements” for the release of prisoners based on factors such as the security and order of the prison, as well as the privacy and safety of the person in custody.In a Facebook post on Tuesday, activist Figo Chan questioned why the democrats were escorted from prison to their homes, suggesting that the practice was unusual.Jailed protesters appearing in gov’t filmsHong Kong prison authorities released two short films on protesters jailed in the wake of the 2019 pro-democracy protests and unrest in early April to promote “law-abiding awareness” among young people.“Adapted from real cases, the microfilms feature stories of teenagers who were incited to commit illegal acts which endanger national security, and paid a heavy price in the end,” the Correctional Services Department (CSD) said in a press release on April 9.

In the nearly three-minute footage, he also says that he regrets his actions, which led him to be jailed under the national security law.86% of national security cases concludedMost of the cases related to the 2019 anti-government protests and national security have been finalised by Hong Kong courts, according to the Judiciary.The Court of Final Appeal.

With the majority of the remaining protest and national security cases scheduled for trial this year, “gradual and more substantial improvements to the court waiting times are anticipated” in the coming years, the Judiciary also said.Democratic Party: No alternative but to disbandHong Kong’s Democratic Party chairperson Lo Kin-hei has said that there is no alternative but to dissolve the opposition party.Appearing on a talk show hosted by former Democratic Party chairperson Emily Lau on April 22, Lo said that the party had originally hoped to continue its work after it elected its central committee in December.Hong Kong’s Democratic Party chairperson Lo Kin-hei meets the press on April 13, 2025, after a special general meeting during which party members approved a motion to move forward with plans to dissolve the opposition party.

Financial Secretary Paul Chan told lawmakers that Hong Kong recorded a HK$80.3 billion deficit in the previous fiscal year, which was HK$6.9 billion lower than the estimate he provided in February when he delivered the 2025 Budget. The deficit was lower than forecast because government revenue of HK$564.9 billion was 1 per cent higher than expected, Chan said.This was mainly due to higher stamp duties and salaries tax received, while government spending – amounting to HK$753.2 billion – was also HK$1.5 billion lower than anticipated.Deficits are expected to narrow annually over the next five years, and government accounts will return to a surplus in the 2028-29 fiscal year, the finance chief told LegCo.As of March 31, the Hong Kong government’s fiscal reserves stood at HK$654.3 billion.

The government also proposed a list of measures to increase revenue, including hiking penalties for traffic-related offences.The authorities also green-lighted the legalisation of basketball betting by launching a one-month public consultation in April.On Wednesday, Chan reiterated that Hong Kong would maintain its free trade policies despite the tariffs imposed by the US earlier this month on Chinese imports, including goods from Hong Kong, which reached a “crazy level” of 245 percent, according to the minister.“In the face of the bullying acts of the US and protectionism, Hong Kong must recognise the new settings and new order of global trade.

HKFP,Hong Kong corrections dept. defends use of private vehicles to release 4 democrats from prison,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/30/hong-kong-corrections-dept-defends-use-of-private-vehicles-to-release-4-democrats-from-prison/,21 hours ago,"Hong Kong’s corrections department has defended the use of private vehicles for the release of four former lawmakers who completed their jail terms for their involvement in an unofficial 2020 primary election.A private vehicle with curtains drawn, one of six, is seen leaving Hong Kong’s Stanley Prison just before sunrise on April 29, 2025. Police at the scene confirmed that pro-democracy activists and former Hong Kong opposition lawmakers Kwok Ka-ki and Jeremy Tam, who were imprisoned under Hong Kong’s National Security Law, have left the prison after finishing jail sentences of four years and two months. Photo: Bertha Wang/AFP.The Correctional Services Department (CSD) told HKFP on Tuesday that it would “make appropriate arrangements” for the release of prisoners based on factors such as the security and order of the prison, as well as the privacy and safety of the person in custody.“The Correctional Services Department handles matters concerning the custody and discharge of persons in custody strictly in accordance with the law,” the CSD wrote in an email to HKFP. HKFP sent enquiries to the CSD shortly after former pro-democracy lawmakers Claudia Mo, Gary Fan, Jeremy Tam, and Kwok Ka-ki were released from prison early Tuesday morning.

Tam and Kwok were discharged from Stanley Prison.The four were the first group of 45 democrats to be discharged from prison in the early morning of Tuesday after being sentenced in the city’s largest national security trial in November. The former legislators were jailed for four years and two months after pleading guilty to the charge of conspiracy to commit subversion.Instead of walking out of prison as released detainees usually do, Mo, Fan, Tam, and Kwok left their respective detention facilities in seven-seater vehicles with curtains drawn.A private vehicle with curtains drawn carrying pro-democracy activist Claudia Mo is seen leaving Hong Kong’s Lo Wu Correctional Institution just before sunrise on April 29, 2025.

The ex-legislator said he was heading home to reunite with his family and thanked Hongkongers and the media for their concern.Journalists also visited Mo’s home. Her husband, Philip Bowring, confirmed with reporters that Mo was inside the flat and resting, adding she was “well and in good spirits.”Inside the living room of Mo’s home, there was a banner that read: “Welcome Home Mum.” In a Facebook post on Tuesday, activist Figo Chan questioned why the democrats were escorted from prison to their homes, suggesting that this practice was unusual. He said the same arrangement was made in January 2022, when independence activist Edward Leung was released from jail after being sentenced to six years for rioting in 2016.“No one could witness it firsthand. This time, I really want to thank your media friends for waiting at various prisons from the early morning… allowing everyone to see it for themselves,” Chan wrote in Chinese.Three handpicked national security judges ruled that the 45 democrats had planned to use their constitutional powers to veto the government budget, ultimately forcing the resignation of the chief executive and a government shutdown.With Mo, Fan, Tam, and Kwok released, there are still 41 democrats serving time in prison for up to 10 years for the charge that evolved around an unofficial primary election held in July 2020. The polls aimed to help the pro-democracy camp win a controlling majority in the legislature. This, the judges ruled, would have resulted in a “constitutional crisis.”Beijing inserted national security legislation directly into Hong Kong’s mini-constitution in June 2020 following a year of pro-democracy protests and unrest. It criminalised subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces and terrorist acts – broadly defined to include disruption to transport and other infrastructure. The move gave police sweeping new powers and led to hundreds of arrests amid new legal precedents, while dozens of civil society groups disappeared. The authorities say it restored stability and peace to the city, rejecting criticism from trade partners, the UN and NGOs.Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | AppsHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team LATEST FROM HKFP China lifts sanctions against five Euro deputies – parliament Explainer: Hong Kong’s national security crackdown – month 58 Chinese business in Vietnam struggles with US tariffs uncertainty Chinese national arrested with surveillance device near Philippine election commission Support HKFP | Code of Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Annual & Transparency Report",Kelly Ho,21 hours ago,HKFP
HKFP,Chinese business in Vietnam struggles with US tariffs uncertainty,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/05/01/chinese-business-in-vietnam-struggles-with-us-tariffs-uncertainty/,2 hours ago,"A year ago Zhang Chundong helped the firm he manages expand into Vietnam, part of a wave of Chinese businesses to choose the booming manufacturing hub since the trade war of US President Donald Trump’s first term.Zhang Chundong, manager at Huochacha New Energy Group, inspecting a forklift at his factory in Bac Ninh province, Vietnam. Photo: AFP.Now the company — a distributor of forklifts made by China’s BYD — is struggling to achieve the fast growth it expected as factory projects stall, and Vietnam waits to see if an enormous 46 percent tariff threatened by Trump this month will materialise.“Some factories that we received orders from are almost ready for operation, but since the tariff news, we got notice that projects and the purchasing of our forklifts are on hold,” said Zhang, manager at Huochacha New Energy Group, whose clients in Vietnam include Chinese electronics company TCL. “We should be in a stage of a rapid growth… (but) due to the tariffs, we are not,” he told AFP.Many Chinese businesses in Vietnam, particularly those exporting directly to the United States, in theory find themselves in a better position than they would be at home, with Beijing already facing levies of up to 145 percent on many products.Hanoi — like much of the rest of the world — has been hit with a blanket 10 percent tariff and has a short window before delayed reciprocal levies come into force in July. There’s still hope that the figure can be negotiated down.But in Vietnam’s northern industrial Bac Ninh province, Chinese businesses that AFP interviewed — most of whom are linked to the export supply chain — said investors were hesitating and anxiety was widespread.Zhang, 39, said he had confidence in the negotiations but explained that three or four of the firm’s projects were on hold.“I’ve talked with a few clients… and the answers at the moment are all the same, we need to keep waiting.”Investment surgeIn Bac Ninh, around 40 kilometres from Hanoi by road, restaurants, massage parlours and convenience stores with Chinese signs jostle for space with Korean shops and eateries.Embed from Getty ImagesSouth Korea has long been a huge investor in Vietnam, with electronics giants such as Samsung and LG both in Bac Ninh — but China is fast catching up.Around 10,000 Chinese people lived in the province by the end of 2023, the latest figure available, and expats in the area said the figure had likely surged since then.“In recent years, Vietnam’s economy has been developing, and China and US keep having trade friction, so many companies that were hesitant before came to Vietnam these two years,” said Wang Hongxin, 40, who moved to Vietnam more than a decade ago to work with a Samsung supplier.One of them is Vietnam Kepai, a Chinese firm which makes computer numerical control machines and expanded into Bac Ninh last month, in search of new markets and to escape fierce competition back home.Li Pingwu, manager of Chinese firm Vietnam Kepai, looking at machines at his factory in Bac Ninh province, Vietnam. Photo: AFP.“There are many companies that are successful in China hoping to explore the market in Vietnam. I’ve heard this conversation so many times in Chinese restaurants (here),” said Li Pingwu, the firm’s 33-year-old manager.The nation ranked third among Vietnam’s top investors in 2024, behind only Singapore and South Korea, with a more than three percent jump compared to the previous year.It also led in terms of new investment projects, representing more than a quarter of all newly registered initiatives.Hours cutThis influx is what appeared to provoke Trump as he announced huge tariffs on Vietnam in early April, with Washington accusing the country of facilitating Chinese exports to the United States and allowing Beijing to get around tariffs.Although a 2024 report by the International Monetary Fund said there was “no clear evidence” of Vietnam’s role in facilitating Chinese exports to the United States, manager Zhang admitted he had seen this happening. “Some of our clients including the ones selling floorboards or moulding machines are doing entrepot trading, involving exports to the US,” he said.Vietnam’s trade ministry has ordered authorities to tighten control over the origin of goods to avoid sanctions by trading partners in the wake of the threatened US tariffs, according to a document seen by AFP on Tuesday.One businessman in Bac Ninh said the surge in investment had once created a worker shortage, but the situation for Vietnamese staff at Chinese companies is now uncertain.Hung, who earns about $270 a month working at a Chinese company producing exterior parts for desktop monitors, said his hours had been cut.“We have stopped getting to work overtime,” said the 30-year-old, who declined to give his full name. “I don’t know how life will be now, as it’s so hard to live here with what I earn.”Wang admitted he was “anxious”.“We originally planned to upgrade some equipment for long-term development, but… because the investment will be quite big, we are a little hesitant now,” he said.Dateline:Vietnam Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | AppsHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team LATEST FROM HKFP China lifts sanctions against five Euro deputies – parliament Explainer: Hong Kong’s national security crackdown – month 58 Chinese business in Vietnam struggles with US tariffs uncertainty Chinese national arrested with surveillance device near Philippine election commission Support HKFP | Code of Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Annual & Transparency Report",AFP,2 hours ago,HKFP
HKFP,Chinese national arrested with surveillance device near Philippine election commission,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/30/chinese-national-arrested-with-surveillance-device-near-philippine-election-commission/,15 hours ago,"A Chinese national was arrested while operating a surveillance device near the offices of the Philippine election commission, authorities said Wednesday, less than two weeks before the country’s mid-term polls.The Philippine Commission on Elections (Comelec) offices are located in the building Palacio Del Gobernador in Manila.

National Bureau of Investigation spokesman Ferdinand Lavin told AFP the latest arrest was made Tuesday near the offices of the Philippine Commission on Elections (Comelec) after agents confirmed the IMSI was in operation.“When we made the arrest, that was the third time he had come to Comelec,” Lavin said, adding other locations visited included the Philippine Supreme Court, Department of Justice and US Embassy.The Philippine Supreme Court building.

Macau is ruled by China.Beijing on Wednesday said it was currently in communications with Manila to learn more about the situation while denying any attempt to tamper with Philippine elections.“We will not and have no interest in interfering in such internal affairs of the Philippines,” foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said when asked about the arrest at a daily press conference.“We also advise individual politicians in the Philippines not to take the chance to hype up issues related to China, make something out of nothing and seize the opportunity to profit,” Guo added.Earlier this month, Beijing made its own allegations of spying, saying it had “destroyed” an intelligence network set up by a Philippine espionage agency and arrested three Filipino spies.The Philippines’ National Security Council (NSC) later said supposed confessions televised on Chinese state media appeared to have been “scripted, strongly suggesting that they were not made freely” and that a spy agency mentioned did not exist. See also: Beijing, Manila trade barbs over disputed South China Sea reefThe espionage accusations come as the two countries confront each other over disputed territory in the South China Sea and as tensions rise over the Philippines’ security ties with ally the United States.Last week, NSC Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya told a Senate hearing that his agency believed Beijing was likely behind online attacks aimed at influencing the coming mid-term polls.The Chinese Embassy strongly denied the allegation.The Philippines’ May 12 elections will decide hundreds of seats in the House of Representatives and Senate as well as thousands of local positions.Dateline:Manila, Philippines Type of Story: News ServiceProduced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic standards.Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | AppsHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team LATEST FROM HKFP China lifts sanctions against five Euro deputies – parliament Explainer: Hong Kong’s national security crackdown – month 58 Chinese business in Vietnam struggles with US tariffs uncertainty Chinese national arrested with surveillance device near Philippine election commission Support HKFP | Code of Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Annual & Transparency Report",AFP,15 hours ago,HKFP
