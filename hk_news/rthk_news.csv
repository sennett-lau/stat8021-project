RTHK,international,Deadly nightclub disaster rocks Dominican Republic,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799484-20250408.htm,"Rescuers were on Tuesday racing to find survivers among the rubble of a Dominican Republic night club where at least 18 people died and dozens were hurt in an early-morning roof collapse. Some 400 rescue personnel were at the Jet Set nightclub in the Caribbean nation's capital Santo Domingo, authorities said, with dozens of ambulances on standby. Local media said there were between 500 and 1,000 people in the club when the roof came down following a sudden blackout during a performance by renowned merengue singer Rubby Perez, who was also trapped in the rubble. Among the dead was the governor of the Monte Cristi municipality, Nelsy Cruz, who died of her injuries in hospital, according to President Luis Abinader. ""We have 18 dead; we continue working with the various institutions that are part of the national emergency center,"" Juan Manuel Mendez, director of the Emergency Operations Center (COE), told journalists. Mendez said rescuers could hear people in the rubble crying out for help. He said there have been 121 trips to hospital with between ""two and three"" injured people per ambulance. ""As long as there is hope for life, all authorities will be working to recover or rescue these people,"" Mendez said. Perez's daughter Zulinka said the singer, 69, was still at the scene of the disaster. ""I don't know if they have him in an ambulance because they're not letting me through."" Local media published images of a construction crane at the scene. ""We are rescuing all the people we can save alive and recovering those bodies we find along the way. But we have focused on people we can rescue alive because we hear them asking for help,"" Mendez said of the ongoing operation. Abinader said on X the government has ""been following the case minute by minute since it happened,"" before rushing to the scene himself. ""The main objective is to save lives... We are deeply affected,"" he said on his arrival.

RTHK,local,Fans delight as Coldplay kick off HK tour,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799473-20250408.htm,"There was fanfare at the Kai Tak Stadium at Tuesday evening as Coldplay kicked off the first of four concerts in Hong Kong on its current world tour. The show marks the British pop band’s return to the SAR after a 16-year hiatus, and the first concert held at the new stadium. Zoe, a longtime Coldplay fan, said she's attending the band’s concert for the first time. “Because it might be the last concert they had in their career, so we're expecting just a very good concert tonight,” she said. Another fan, Judy, got the standing ticket that puts her right next to the stage. “I hope there will be fireworks tonight,” she said. “We already know the routine playlist, but I still want to hear if somebody's gonna order a song. My favourite song is ‘Every Teardrop is a Waterfall.’” She was upset about missing Coldplay’s previous world tour and said this time is a dream come true. “Actually, I used to study in London, but I think it's 2018, 2019, that’s the time they stopped the world tour. So it's such a shame that I didn't get a chance to see the tour. This time is like my dream comes true,” she said. Organisers allowed people to bring empty reusable plastic or silicone bottles that can hold up to 600 millilitres of liquid into the stadium. There were restrictions to bag size while a list of items, including professional cameras and handheld signs, are prohibited. Most fans whom RTHK spoke to, including Bertha, found the rules reasonable. “I'm aware of this and I think it's quite normal to have such restrictions. Because when I was in Taiwan and New Zealand, they didn't allow people to bring water bottles inside as well,” she said. Once the concert got underway, the atmosphere was electric. It started with the band's vocalist, Chris Martin, greeting fans in Cantonese. He said Coldplay were delighted to be in Hong Kong. Fans reached another frenzy when local singer Marf, from the girl group Collar, was invited as a guest to perform with the band. The band also handed out LED wristbands that lit up in different colours for each song. Police, meanwhile, said five people were arrested on suspicion of re-selling tickets at inflated prices. Coldplay will put on three more sold-out shows at Kai Tak Stadium on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. _____________________________ Last updated: 2025-04-08 HKT 22:51","Tue, 08 Apr 2025 19:58:47 +0800","There was fanfare at the Kai Tak Stadium at Tuesday evening as Coldplay kicked off the first of four concerts in Hong Kong on its current world tour.

RTHK,local,Tram fares to go up on May 12,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799459-20250408.htm,"Tram fares will go up by up to 15 percent starting from May 12. The rise comes after the Executive Council approved an application from Hong Kong Tramways. The government said the new fare will be HK$3.30, or 10 percent more, for those aged 12 and above. The rise will be steeper for the elderly, as their new fare of HK$1.50 is an increase of 15 percent. Children aged between three and eleven will pay HK$1.60, or a rise of nearly 7 percent. The price for monthly tickets will stay the same at HK$260. The government said a number of factors were considered as part of the vetting process, such as rising operating costs, the quality and quantity of service provided and public acceptability. ""The government considered the fare increase necessary for maintaining stable operation, and that [its] proposed level of increase is acceptable,"" a spokesperson said in a statement. ""After the fare increase, the tramway remains the most economical means of transportation serving the northern shore of Hong Kong Island."" Officials said they'll continue to work with the company and encourage it to find different sources of revenue, especially tying in with its concept of ""tourism everywhere"" and preserving its historical value. The last fare increase for trams was in July 2022, when different classes of charges also rose by up to around 15 percent.","Tue, 08 Apr 2025 18:23:07 +0800","Tram fares will go up by up to 15 percent starting from May 12.

RTHK,local,HK to target creative industry in strategic push,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799460-20250408.htm,"Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Tuesday the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, OASES, will seek to attract cultural enterprises in the future in a way that combines innovation and technology with artistry. He made the comments at a signing ceremony between the office and 16 companies, including Ant Digital Technologies and China Mobile Innovation Research Institute. Chan said the creative and cultural industries hold huge power and their development is unstoppable. “This sector, enriching lives, sparking joy and preaching cultures, is among the fastest growing in the world,” he said. ""How artistic toys and animation have captivated audiences globally is simply amazing. “Through Hong Kong's platform, creative pioneers can indeed extend their reach across continents.” Chan also said more than 80 strategic enterprises have set up in Hong Kong in the past two years, and will bring nearly HK$50 billion worth of investment and create more than 20,000 jobs. Car company Li Auto is among the companies securing a partnership agreement with OASES. Its senior vice president, Li Guanhua, said the company is looking to invest around HK$20 billion in the city. “We chose to come to Hong Kong to develop a core research centre this year because we value Hong Kong’s position in the whole economic, financial and fintech aspect,” she said. ""Our investment in Hong Kong will be long term."" Li said the Hong Kong office will serve as an offshore clearing centre, as well as a research centre for AI facilities. When asked whether US tariffs would affect company sales, Li said the firm only started developing its overseas market this year but the United States would not be its target. Another company, Enlight Medical, said Hong Kong provides a stable environment given the current chaos created by US tariffs. “The Hong Kong government said it will not follow Beijing’s decision to impose retaliatory tariffs on the US,” said co-founder Rocky Bian of the health technology company. ""This helps us stabilise our global supply chain. “Hong Kong is a free port. Apart from re-export trades, the city also provides stability in importing machine components and raw materials from the US.” Bian said the company will hire around 900 workers in a few years time, spanning from researchers to quality assurance talent. The cost of operating in Hong Kong, he added, does not differ by much from mainland cities. Web 3 auditing company CertiK said it hopes to safeguard technology development in Hong Kong. “Hong Kong is a hub of the financial supply chain and market, and the government is also promoting and encouraging business development in this area,” said its chief security officer Li Kang.

RTHK,finance,HK stocks ends with slight rebound,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799430-20250408.htm,"Asian and European markets battled on Tuesday to recover from the previous day's tariff-fuelled collapse, though Donald Trump's warning of more measures against China and Beijing's vow to ""fight to the end"" raised concerns of a spiralling trade war. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index ended 299.38 points, or 1.51 percent, higher at 20,127.68, but that was well short of recouping Monday's loss of more than 13 percent, the biggest one-day retreat since 1997. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed 2.31 percent to end at 7,430.62 while the Hang Seng Tech Index jumped 3.79 percent to end at 4,568.38. The Hang Seng Index's gains came a day after equities across the world have been hammered since the US president unveiled sweeping levies against friend and foe, upending trading norms, sparking talk of a global recession and wiping trillions of company valuations. Investors fought to claw back some of those losses as they try to assess the possibility that Washington could temper some of the tariffs. Tokyo traded up more than six percent – recovering much of Monday's drop – after Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba held talks with Trump. However, the US leader's threat to hit China with an extra 50 percent tariffs – in response to its 34 percent retaliation in kind – ramped up the chances of a catastrophic stand-off between the two economic superpowers. While uncertainty rules, investors in most markets took the opportunity to pick up some beaten-down stocks. In Tokyo, Nippon Steel closely matched the Nikkei's rebound after Trump launched a review of its proposed takeover of US Steel that was blocked by his predecessor Joe Biden. Shanghai advanced 1.6 percent after China's central bank promised to back major state-backed fund Central Huijin Investment in a bid to maintain ""the smooth operation of the capital market"". Sydney and Mumbai added more than two percent, while Manila gained three percent. Seoul and Wellington also edged up.

""We are very disappointed by the US move, especially considering the deep and long-standing friendship between our two countries,"" he said in an address to parliament. ""These are not actions one does to a friend."" Singapore was hit with a 10 percent tariff despite a free-trade agreement with the United States.

""Singapore may or may not go into recession this year, but I have no doubt that our growth will be significantly impacted,"" he said. The trade ministry is reassessing its economic growth forecast this year of 1 to 3 percent ""and will likely revise it downwards,"" he added. Wong said that under the US-Singapore FTA, the city-state imposes zero tariffs on American goods. Singapore also runs a trade deficit with Washington. ""If the tariffs were truly reciprocal and if they were meant to target only those with trade surpluses, then the tariff for Singapore should be zero,"" he said. Singapore hosts thousands of US companies and many of them have made the city their Asia-Pacific headquarters. While the island-nation is not a US defence treaty ally, it enjoys robust military ties with Washington. ""This marks a profound turning point,"" he said. ""We are entering a new phase in global affairs, one that is more arbitrary, protectionist and dangerous."" (AFP)",2025-04-08 15:23:05
RTHK,greater_china,Vance slammed over impolite 'Chinese peasants' remarks,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799420-20250408.htm,"China on Tuesday condemned US Vice President JD Vance as ""ignorant and impolite"", after he referred to Washington borrowing money from ""Chinese peasants"".

US President Donald Trump has upended the world economy with sweeping tariffs that have raised the spectre of an international recession but ruled out any pause in his aggressive trade policy despite a dramatic market sell-off. Speaking to Fox News on Thursday, Vance defended those tariffs as an antidote to a ""globalist economy"" that he said had not worked for ordinary Americans.

RTHK,finance,Any Trump bid to weaken greenback 'set to fail',https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799408-20250408.htm,"Any American attempt to pull off a 1985 Plaza Accord-type coordinated depreciation of the US dollar likely won't work as it would require the consent of China and Europe, Japan's former top currency diplomat Naoyuki Shinohara said on Tuesday. Some analysts believe the Trump administration may push through a ""Mar-a-Lago Accord"" – a grand bargain to weaken the overvalued dollar – to reduce the huge US trade deficit. Unlike for the Plaza Accord when the United States could work just with close allies Japan and Germany, Washington would need to engage more countries – including the China and European Union – to weaken the dollar effectively in a globalised market, Shinohara said. Having antagonised China and Europe with his decision to impose what he describes as reciprocal tariffs, US President Donald Trump will find it extremely difficult to get their consent, Shinohara added. ""In times like now, you need China to be in the loop, as well as European nations,"" Shinohara said in an interview. ""That would be quite hard under the current circumstances. ""Currency intervention, even if coordinated among nations, has become less effective because markets have become so big."" As Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs from 2007 to 2009, Shinohara negotiated with his US and European counterparts for their cooperation in curbing sharp yen rises that were hurting Japan's export-heavy economy. He was also deeply involved in world-wide efforts among policymakers to deal with the global financial crisis caused by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. ""In most past shocks, one could identify the cause,"" Shinohara said.

She was speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme on Tuesday on Washington's recent tariff barrage launched across the world, including an additional 34 percent tariff on Chinese imports. In response, Beijing hit back with tariffs of 34 percent on all goods from the United States and added 11 US firms to its unreliable entity list. Ip, who's also the New People's Party chairwoman, said Trump is effectively ceding the role of champion of free trade and rule-based multilateral system to China. ""In the long term, China will be the winner, in terms of trade, technology and moral high ground,"" she said. Ip stressed that if Trump does decide to retaliate further, it will only continue to plummet global markets, and that the tariff war will likely continue unless Trump's tycoon backers reign him in or Republicans get burned in the midterm elections next year. As for the likelihood of a global recession, Ip said it's likely. ""The SAR government should work out a panoply of policy options to buoy the local economy pending a global recession,"" she said. When asked about the SAR not setting any countermeasures to the US tariffs, Ip said Hong Kong will continue to be a free port, noting that the city is bound by the Basic Law, as well as its tariff commitments to the World Trade Organization. Weighing in on the same issue, Andrew Leung, China strategist and former senior Hong Kong government official, said the US was upending the very trade institutes it helped create after World War II.

RTHK,international,Kennedy gets teeth into ending US fluoridation,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799385-20250408.htm,"US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr said he plans to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation in communities nationwide. Kennedy said on Monday he’s assembling a task force of health experts to study the issue and make new recommendations. Also on Monday, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced it is reviewing “new scientific information"" on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water. The EPA sets the maximum level allowed in public water systems. Kennedy was speaking after a news conference with EPA administrator Lee Zeldin in Salt Lake City. Kennedy cannot order communities to stop fluoridation, but he can direct the CDC to stop recommending it and work with the EPA to change the allowed amount. Utah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities. Republican governor Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their drinking water. Water systems across the state must stop fluoridation by May 7. Opponents say the law will hurt residents who can’t afford regular dentist visits and may rely on public drinking water containing fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care. Kennedy oversees the CDC, whose recommendations are widely followed but not mandatory. State and local governments decide whether to add fluoride to water and, if so, how much – as long as it doesn’t exceed a maximum set by the EPA, which is currently four milligrams per liter. Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and in 1962 they set guidelines for how much should be added to water. Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a “dangerous neurotoxin” and said it has been associated with arthritis, bone breaks and thyroid disease. Some studies have suggested such links might exist, usually at higher-than-recommended fluoride levels, though some reviewers have questioned the quality of available evidence and said no definitive conclusions can be drawn.

RTHK,international,World temps near record highs in March: scientists,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799381-20250408.htm,"Global temperatures hovered at historic highs in March, Europe's climate monitor said on Tuesday, prolonging an extraordinary heat streak that has tested scientific expectations. In Europe, it was the hottest March ever recorded by a significant margin, said the Copernicus Climate Change Service, driving rainfall extremes across a continent warming faster than any other. The world, meanwhile, saw the second-hottest March in the Copernicus dataset, sustaining a near-unbroken spell of record or near-record-breaking temperatures that has persisted since July 2023. Since then, virtually every month has been at least 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than it was before the industrial revolution when humanity began burning massive amounts of coal, oil and gas. March was 1.6C above pre-industrial times, prolonging an anomaly so extreme that scientists are still trying to fully explain it. ""That we're still at 1.6C above pre-industrial is indeed remarkable,"" said Friederike Otto of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial College London. Scientists warn that every fraction of a degree of global warming increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall and droughts. Climate change is not just about rising temperatures but the knock-on effect of all that extra heat being trapped in the atmosphere and seas by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. Warmer seas mean higher evaporation and greater moisture in the atmosphere, causing heavier deluges and feeding energy into cyclones, but also affecting global rainfall patterns. March in Europe was 0.26C above the previous hottest record for the month set in 2014, Copernicus said. It was also ""a month with contrasting rainfall extremes"" across the continent, said Samantha Burgess of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which runs the Copernicus climate monitor. Some parts of Europe experienced their ""driest March on record and others their wettest"" for about half a century, Burgess said. Elsewhere in March, scientists said that climate change intensified an extreme heatwave across Central Asia and fuelled conditions for extreme rainfall which killed 16 people in Argentina. The spectacular surge in global heat pushed 2023 and then 2024 to become the hottest years on record. Last year was also the first full calendar year to exceed 1.5C: the safer warming limit agreed by most nations under the Paris climate accord. This represented a temporary, not permanent breach, of this longer-term target, but scientists have warned that the goal of keeping temperatures below that threshold is slipping further out of reach. Scientists had expected that the extraordinary heat spell would subside after a warming El Nino event peaked in early 2024, and conditions gradually shifted to a cooling La Nina phase. But global temperatures have remained stubbornly high, sparking debate among scientists about what other factors could be driving warming to the top end of expectations. Scientists say the current period is likely the warmest the Earth has been for the last 125,000 years. (AFP)","Tue, 08 Apr 2025 11:13:44 +0800","Global temperatures hovered at historic highs in March, Europe's climate monitor said on Tuesday, prolonging an extraordinary heat streak that has tested scientific expectations. In Europe, it was the hottest March ever recorded by a significant margin, said the Copernicus Climate Change Service, driving rainfall extremes across a continent warming faster than any other. The world, meanwhile, saw the second-hottest March in the Copernicus dataset, sustaining a near-unbroken spell of record or near-record-breaking temperatures that has persisted since July 2023. Since then, virtually every month has been at least 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than it was before the industrial revolution when humanity began burning massive amounts of coal, oil and gas. March was 1.6C above pre-industrial times, prolonging an anomaly so extreme that scientists are still trying to fully explain it. ""That we're still at 1.6C above pre-industrial is indeed remarkable,"" said Friederike Otto of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial College London. Scientists warn that every fraction of a degree of global warming increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall and droughts. Climate change is not just about rising temperatures but the knock-on effect of all that extra heat being trapped in the atmosphere and seas by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. Warmer seas mean higher evaporation and greater moisture in the atmosphere, causing heavier deluges and feeding energy into cyclones, but also affecting global rainfall patterns. March in Europe was 0.26C above the previous hottest record for the month set in 2014, Copernicus said. It was also ""a month with contrasting rainfall extremes"" across the continent, said Samantha Burgess of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which runs the Copernicus climate monitor. Some parts of Europe experienced their ""driest March on record and others their wettest"" for about half a century, Burgess said. Elsewhere in March, scientists said that climate change intensified an extreme heatwave across Central Asia and fuelled conditions for extreme rainfall which killed 16 people in Argentina.

South Korea has been effectively leaderless since December, when former president Yoon attempted to subvert civilian rule but was quickly impeached by lawmakers and suspended from office. A court last week upheld his impeachment, stripping him of the top job, and triggering fresh elections, which must be held within 60 days. The government had held ""discussions with the National Election Commission and other related agencies"", Acting President and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said on Tuesday. It also took into account ""the need to ensure smooth election operations and allow sufficient time for political parties to prepare,"" he said. As a result they have decided ""to set June 3 as the date for South Korea's 21st presidential election,"" he said, adding that the day would be designated as a temporary public holiday to facilitate voting. Han called upon ministries and the National Election Commission to ""make thorough preparations to ensure an election that is fairer and more transparent than ever, and one that can earn the trust of the people."" Unlike a regular poll, where a president-elect has a two-month transition period, the winner of the June 3 election will be inaugurated the following day. Han resumed acting as president recently after the Constitutional Court threw out his own impeachment. Presidential elections are typically held on Wednesdays, but no specific weekday is required for snap polls triggered by a vacancy. The official campaign period will run from May 12 until June 2. Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung is the frontrunner in any polls, with a 34 percent support rating according to the latest Gallup poll. His party already controls the National Assembly. He narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election but staged a political comeback as leader of the main opposition, despite a career shadowed by legal troubles, including ongoing trials. In distant second place is Labour Minister Kim Moon-soo. Polling around nine percent, he leads a pack of challengers from Yoon's People Power Party, which also includes former party chief Han Dong-hoon.

Eddie Howe's men, still on a high after winning the League Cup last month, are up to fifth in the table, level on points with fourth-placed Chelsea but with a game in hand. Fifth place will almost certainly be enough to secure a place in the Champions League next season after strong performances by English clubs in continental competition.

Hours later Tehran confirmed discussions were set for Saturday in Oman, but stressed they were ""indirect"" talks. ""Iran and the United States will meet in Oman on Saturday for indirect high-level talks,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on social media platform X. ""It is as much an opportunity as it is a test,"" he added. ""The ball is in America's court."" Netanyahu meanwhile said the United States and Israel were working on another deal to free hostages from war-torn Gaza, where a ceasefire between Israel and Iran's ally Hamas has collapsed. ""We're dealing with the Iranians, we have a very big meeting on Saturday and we're dealing with them directly,"" Trump told reporters after a meeting that was meant to focus on Israel's bid to avoid US tariffs. Trump did not say where the talks would take place, but insisted they would not involve surrogates and would be at ""almost the highest level.""

RTHK,international,Supreme Court backs Trump over Alien Enemies Act,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799334-20250408.htm,"The US Supreme Court handed Donald Trump a victory on Monday by letting him use a 1798 law that historically has been employed only in wartime to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members as part of the Republican president's hardline approach to immigration. The court granted the administration's request to lift Washington-based US Judge James Boasberg's March 15 order that had temporarily blocked the summary deportations under Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act while litigation in the case continues. Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act on March 15 to swiftly deport the alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang, attempting to speed up removals with a law best known for its use to intern Japanese, Italian and German immigrants during World War Two. In a legal challenge handled by the American Civil Liberties Union, a group of Venezuelan men in the custody of US immigration authorities on the same day sued on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, seeking to block the deportations. They argued, among other things, that Trump's order exceeded his powers because the Alien Enemies Act authorises removals only when war has been declared or the United States has been invaded. The Alien Enemies Act authorises the president to deport, detain or place restrictions on individuals whose primary allegiance is to a foreign power and who might pose a national security risk in wartime. Boasberg, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, temporarily blocked the deportations. But Trump's administration allowed two planes already in the air to continue to El Salvador where American officials handed 238 Venezuelan men over to Salvadoran authorities to be placed in the Central American country's ""Terrorism Confinement Center."" The judge also has scrutinized whether the Trump administration violated his order by failing to return the deportation flights after his order was issued. Justice Department lawyers said the flights had left US airspace by the time Boasberg issued a written order and thus were not required to return. They dismissed the weight of Boasberg's spoken order during a hearing two hours earlier calling for any planes carrying deportees to be turned around. Trump's administration has argued that Boasberg's temporary ban encroached on presidential authority to make national security decisions. On March 18, Trump called for Boasberg's impeachment by Congress - a process that could remove him from the bench - drawing a rebuke from the US Chief Justice John Roberts. Trump on social media called Boasberg, who was confirmed by the US Senate in 2011 in a bipartisan 96-0 vote, a ""Radical Left Lunatic"" and a ""troublemaker and agitator."" The DC Circuit upheld Boasberg's order after holding a contentious hearing that involved heated language. Judge Patricia Millett told Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign that ""Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here."" Ensign responded, ""We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy."" Family members of many of the deported Venezuelan migrants deny the alleged gang ties. Lawyers for one of the deportees, a Venezuelan professional soccer player and youth coach, said US officials had wrongly labelled him a gang member based on a tattoo of a crown meant to honour his favourite team, Real Madrid.

""If China does not withdraw its 34 percent increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50 percent, effective April 9th,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post.

Organisers in the western city of Osaka barred people from coming near the affected area for about an hour to ventilate it. The site of Expo 2025, which opens on Sunday, was once a landfill.

""I don't want anything to go down,"" he said as he returned from a weekend of golf in Florida. ""But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something. Trump said he had spoken to leaders from Europe and Asia over the weekend, who hope to convince him to lower tariffs as high as 50 percent due to take effect this week. ""They are coming to the table,"" he said. ""They want to talk but there's no talk unless they pay us a lot of money on a yearly basis."" Trump's barrage of tariffs announced last week was met with bewildered condemnation from other leaders and triggered retaliatory levies from China, the world's No 2 economy. Billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman, who endorsed Trump's run for president, called for the tariffs to be paused to avert an ""economic nuclear war"". Investors and political leaders have struggled to determine whether Trump's tariffs are part of a permanent new regime or a negotiating tactic to win concessions from other countries. On Sunday morning talk shows, Trump's top economic advisers sought to portray the tariffs as a savvy repositioning of the United States in the global trade order.

""A lot of people are asking me, or are telling me, that I have the chance to become number one if Jannik is not playing,"" Alcaraz said ahead of the Monte Carlo Masters. ""So probably that pressure has killed me in some way."" The 21-year-old Spaniard added that staying at world number three has not come as a shock to him. ""I'm not surprised because the people always say that we have to win the tournaments or the top people have to be there all the time playing finals or winning tournaments,"" he said. Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz has endured a tough start to 2025, with his only title coming on the hard courts of Rotterdam two months ago.

He won the French Open last year, as well as back-to-back Madrid Masters in 2022 and 2023. Sinner has been out of action since accepting a three-month doping ban in February after twice testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year. The 23-year-old Italian is due to return in time for the Rome Open in May. Alcaraz, currently trailing Sinner by 3,610 points in the rankings, said he has been at peace with not usurping the Italian as the world's best player. ""I'm just thinking that I'm not able to become number one... in the clay season, even if Jannik is not playing, I don't have the chance to do it,"" he said. ""I think I'm too far from Jannik.

RTHK,sport,Man City held by Man Utd in derby stalemate,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799169-20250407.htm,"Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said his side must improve ""everywhere"" after a dismal derby against Manchester City ended 0-0 on Sunday. City's hopes of Champions League qualification remain in the balance as they remain fifth in the Premier League, which should be enough to reach next season's Champions League. However, Pep Guardiola's men are just two points above Newcastle, who have two games in hand on City. A point leaves United languishing down in 13th, but they had the better of a game limited in chances as they missed out on a first league double over City since 2019/20. ""We have so many aspects to improve. Everywhere we need to improve in every aspect: build up, transition, decisions in the final third,"" said Amorim. ""Every player can improve, they are here because they showed something at other clubs. They have the quality, but we are still a team that plays on transition, we need to spend more time in final third to have more opportunities."" Never in the Premier League era have neither City or United finished in the top four but that record is under severe threat in the coming months. A contest devoid of quality, intensity or fight summed up a dreadful season for both sides of the Manchester divide. After a record four consecutive league titles, City's form has fallen off a cliff to leave them at risk of not making the top four for the first time since 2009/10. United's only chance of Champions League qualification is by winning the Europa League as they are set for their worst ever Premier League finish. The Red Devils have shown flashes of improvement this week but also failed to score in their 1-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest on Tuesday to underline their problem in front of goal. ""We just need to have a bit more of a killer instinct,"" said United captain Bruno Fernandes. ""In the first half we had to many touches when we just needed one. We were patient, very organised but the killer instinct was missing today."" Kevin De Bruyne started just days after announcing this will be his final season at City. But the Belgian's performance was the latest example that he is now a shadow of the figure Guardiola said will be remembered as one of the Premier League's all-time greats. City had the majority of the ball, but United were the more threatening side on the counter-attack in a pedestrian first half. ""We were not good enough to punish them or hurt them a little bit more than what happened,"" said Guardiola. ""We take the point. It would be better to win but still we are there."" Phil Foden had the game's best chance just seconds after half-time but fluffed his lines with only Andre Onana to beat. The spectacle did marginally improve after the break as Omar Marmoush's powerful effort from a corner stung the palms of Onana. Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount's introduction off the bench added more thrust to the United attack in the final 20 minutes. Both had a chance to win it when Zirkzee's shot was clawed away by Ederson and Rico Lewis did well to get in the way of Mount's follow-up effort. There were smiles during a warm embrace between Guardiola and Amorim at full-time but those pleasantries disguised the fact that neither man can be happy with the state of their sides after a disappointing campaign.

The vice president added the family no longer intends to seek financial aid to pay for her father's defence. ""If we need to [sell] things to support our financial needs, we will do that,"" she said. Rodrigo Duterte was arrested on March 11 and whisked away the same day to the Netherlands-based tribunal to face charges tied to his drug war, in which thousands of mostly poor men were killed. Daughter Sara followed him to The Hague immediately after and had been coordinating his legal affairs and acting as his mouthpiece, holding a number of press conferences outside the court building. She landed at Manila's international airport on Sunday night, according to her communications team. The vice president returns as her family's PDP Laban party is lagging in polls ahead of May mid-term elections that will determine 12 Senate seats and thousands of smaller positions across the archipelago nation of 117 million. The Duterte clan is embroiled in a bitter feud with President Ferdinand Marcos, a one-time ally and Sara's running mate in the 2022 presidential campaign, which they won in a landslide. Sara Duterte was impeached by the House of Representatives in early February for ""violation of the constitution, betrayal of public trust, graft and corruption, and other high crimes"". Her Senate trial is set to take place following the May 12 mid-term election, the results of which will determine who serves as her jurors.

RTHK,sport,Doncic soars as Lakers silence Thunder,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799203-20250407.htm,"Luka Doncic scored 30 points as the Los Angeles Lakers produced a devastating display of long-range shooting to score a surprising 126-99 blowout over the No1 ranked Oklahoma City Thunder. A heavyweight showdown between the Western Conference leaders and the third-placed Lakers was effectively settled in the first half, as Los Angeles rattled in 15 three-pointers, a franchise record, to open up a 78-56 lead at the end of the second quarter. The Lakers never looked like surrendering that hefty double-digit cushion as they closed out a comfortable win to silence the Oklahoma City home crowd. The win saw the Lakers edge closer to securing one of the four remaining automatic playoff spots in the West after already-qualified Oklahoma City and Houston. The Lakers poured in 22 three-pointers across the game, with Doncic responsible for five of them. Austin Reaves had four three-pointers in his 20 point haul, while LeBron James added 19 points. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Oklahoma City scoring with 26 points on an off-night for the Thunder, who shot just 43 percent from the field while making only 12-of-37 three-pointers. James meanwhile said the Lakers had been determined not to let up after making a fast start against the Western Conference leaders. ""Between them and Cleveland, they're the best teams in the NBA,"" James said. ""They're the number one team in the West so you can't let up no matter what the score is – they're always going to make a push. That's why they are where they are at this part of the season. ""So it's a really good win for us and we can build off it... we're just trying to build our habits right now, going into the final stretch of the year."" Reaves meanwhile believes the result augured well for the final week of the regular season, which reaches its conclusion on April 13. Six teams are battling for four playoff spots in the West, from the third-placed Lakers (48-30) down to the eighth-placed Memphis Grizzlies (46-32). ""It's huge,"" Reaves said. ""The way the standings are, you can go from third to eighth in the snap of a finger. So for us to come in and play such a good team the way we did tonight is big. Hopefully we can build on that momentum."" Elsewhere on Sunday, the Cleveland Cavaliers missed the chance to lock up the No.1 seeding in the Eastern Conference after suffering a 120-113 home defeat to the Sacramento Kings.

RTHK,international,Seoul to set presidential election for June 3: Yonhap,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799191-20250407.htm,"South Korea's cabinet is expected to finalise a June 3 date for a presidential election following the removal of Yoon Suk Yeol last week for his short-lived martial law declaration, Yonhap news said on Monday. Although not required by law, the cabinet will make the decision at a meeting on Tuesday, as it needs to approve a holiday for the event, Yonhap cited an unidentified government official as saying. RTHK's correspondent in Seoul, Frank Smith, said Lee Jae-myung, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), was considered the frontrunner in a new election, having lost to Yoon in 2022 by a margin of less than one percent. ""He's widely favoured. He's got something like a margin of 34 percent approval to nine percent for the second candidate of the Conservative bloc. So he's looking pretty good. He does have some legal problems, however, that could affect his campaign and possibly even prevent him from running, although he cleared a hurdle in that regard about two weeks ago,"" said Smith. Yoon was removed by the Constitutional Court on grounds of having violated his official duty by issuing the martial law decree on December 3 and mobilising troops to halt parliamentary proceedings. The law requires a new presidential election within 60 days if the incumbent dies or is removed from office. An official of the National Election Commission said the date mentioned in media reports was not final and would not become official until declared by the acting president, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo. Smith said he did not think Yoon's removal would be the end of the current political crisis in South Korea. ""South Korea has some serious political divisions that really bubbled to the surface over the past four months. Those are going to remain here. For Yoon, on the legal front, the impeachment is just one aspect of this. He still has a criminal trial to go. His lawyers prioritised the impeachment trial and kind of set aside the criminal trial as much as possible... So he has some pretty serious charges of insurrection to face, again, looking at a long prison sentence and perhaps even a death penalty, although most people suggest that's quite unlikely.""

RTHK,finance,Hang Seng Index slumps on US tariff sell-off,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799185-20250407.htm,"Financial markets in Hong Kong and across the border dived on Monday as markets around the world crumbled in the face of a widening global trade war and fears it will unleash a deep recession. The Hang Seng index slumped more than 10 percent in morning trade which, if sustained, would make for the benchmark's largest daily fall since the 2008 global financial crisis. Banking stocks collapsed, with Hong Kong-listed shares of HSBC and Standard Chartered tumbling 15 percent. The CSI300 blue-chip index fell more than 5 percent with selling in nearly every sector. The yuan slipped to its lowest since January and bonds rallied sharply. China, which is now facing US tariffs of over 50 percent, responded in kind on Friday by slapping extra levies on US imports. Mainland indexes of solar companies and household appliance makers notched losses around 10 percent. The Hang Seng volatility index shot to its highest since October. Shares of online giants Alibaba and Tencent were down more than 8 percent. ""It's a harsh time when markets go down so dramatically,"" said Andrew Sullivan, founder of Asian Market Sense, who noted that the latest plunge came as investors race to liquidate some of their shares in the face of a cash crunch following a market meltdown, especially for those who trade using margin financing, or borrowing money from brokers to purchase an investment. ""But one should get over the initial panic of wanting to sell, because a lot of the time these markets rebound within days or weeks,"" he said. ""That said, this current situation with tariffs being imposed by Trump, and then retaliatory tariffs by China does indicate that this is a situation that's unlikely to resolve itself anytime soon."" For his part, Alex Wong, director of Alex KY Wong Asset Management, said ""the [market sell-off] was beyond my expectation. ""This is a liquidation sale as people sought to exit [the market]. But the magnitude of the decline was more than expected."" He expects Beijing to offer stimulus measures in the short term to stabilise the market, such as a cut in the reserve requirement ratio for banks or a tax cut as part of a package of stronger fiscal support. Noting that the chance of the global economy to enter a recession this year has increased to at least 60 to 70 percent following the tit-for-tat tariff disputes between the world's two largest economies, Wong said a deal between the two sides is needed but difficult to realise. ""China knows that if it complies with US demands, this will reinforce Trump's ego and he will ask for more later on, that's why China took a hard stance now. It would be very difficult for both sides to reach a deal. ""We probably will be in a bear market for a long time,"" Wong said. Separately, Sullivan noted that the a key event to follow is whether the US Congress representatives from both parties will stop Trump from implementing the reciprocal tariffs – by revoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergency Act that Trump used to impose the tariffs. ""Historically, if you saw the VIX index (a barometer for market uncertainty) is above 32, 33 percent, you'd normally get a policy changed by the government."" ""[But] the VIX index on Friday got above 40 percent, and we've seen no change of Trump turning about or evoking his trade policy. So it's a very difficult position,"" he said. ""But if they [Congress members] feel that their own caucuses and electorate are going to turn against them, they will have to make a choice. ""Do they stick with Trump who is unlikely to have a third term, or do they stick with their electorate, and support them and go against trump?

Australia's stock index plummeted 6 percent at the open on Monday. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Monday that the government would continue to ask President Trump to lower tariffs against Japan, but acknowledged results ""won't come overnight."" ""As such, the government must take all available means"" to cushion the economic blow from US tariffs, such as offering funding support for domestic firms and taking measures to protect jobs, Ishiba told parliament. Ishiba said Trump's decision to slap tariffs on imports from Japan was ""extremely disappointing and regrettable,"" adding that Japan would continue to explain that it had done nothing unfair to the United States. Ishiba also said he was willing to visit the United States for a meeting with Trump as soon as possible. ""But in doing so, we must ready a package of steps on what Japan could do,"" he added. Trump's decision to slap a 25 percent levy on auto imports, and a reciprocal 24 percent tariff on other Japanese goods, is expected to deal a huge blow to Japan's export-heavy economy with analysts predicting the higher duties could knock up to 0.8 percent off economic growth.

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Monday that the government would continue to ask President Trump to lower tariffs against Japan, but acknowledged results ""won't come overnight."" ""As such, the government must take all available means"" to cushion the economic blow from US tariffs, such as offering funding support for domestic firms and taking measures to protect jobs, Ishiba told parliament. Ishiba said Trump's decision to slap tariffs on imports from Japan was ""extremely disappointing and regrettable,"" adding that Japan would continue to explain that it had done nothing unfair to the United States. Ishiba also said he was willing to visit the United States for a meeting with Trump as soon as possible. ""But in doing so, we must ready a package of steps on what Japan could do,"" he added. Trump's decision to slap a 25 percent levy on auto imports, and a reciprocal 24 percent tariff on other Japanese goods, is expected to deal a huge blow to Japan's export-heavy economy with analysts predicting the higher duties could knock up to 0.8 percent off economic growth.

RTHK,international,"Second US child dies of measles, almost 650 ill",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799174-20250407.htm,"A measles outbreak has killed a second child in the southwestern United States, authorities said on Sunday, with almost 650 people now infected as the highly-contagious disease spreads. The school-aged child, who was unvaccinated and had no underlying health conditions, died on Thursday in the hospital from measles pulmonary failure, the Texas Department of State Health Services said. ""The child was receiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalised,"" Aaron Davis, a spokesperson for UMC Health System in Lubbock, Texas, said in an email. It is the second death of a child in Texas since the measles outbreak began in late January. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, in a post on X, identified the child as eight-year-old Daisy Hildebrand. Kennedy, who has been an anti-vaccine advocate and previously has said vaccination is a personal choice, on Sunday said vaccines are the best protection against measles. ""The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,"" he said in the post on X. He said that as of Sunday there are 642 confirmed cases of measles, 499 of those in Texas. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recorded cases stretching from Alaska to Florida, as well as in New York City. Texas had reported its first measles death, also of a child, in late February - marking the first US fatality from the disease in nearly a decade. The death of a New Mexico adult last month was also classified by the CDC as a measles-related fatality. The vast majority of measles cases tallied by the CDC - 97 percent - are patients not vaccinated against the measles, it said on April 3. The measles vaccine is 97 percent effective after two shots. Paediatricians and other doctors are pushing back against vaccine hesitancy and warning parents that vitamin A and other supplements touted by vaccine critics will not protect their children from the highly contagious and potentially fatal disease.

But his staggered deadlines have left space for some countries to negotiate, even as he insisted he would stand firm and his administration warned against any retaliation. ""More than 50 countries have reached out to the president to begin a negotiation,"" Kevin Hassett, head of the White House National Economic Council, told CNN on Sunday, citing the US Trade Representative.

""I don't think that you're going to see a big effect on the consumer in the US,"" he said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also told NBC's Meet the Press that 50 countries had reached out.

The Dutch Red Bull driver crossed the finish line almost 1.5 seconds in front of Briton Norris, who held off his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri of Australia in third. The win on a damp but drying track at Suzuka was Verstappen's fourth straight victory in Japan and closed the gap on Norris at the top of the drivers' championship to one point. ""It was tough.

Leandro Trossard's opener for the Gunners was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye's penalty to leave Arsenal trailing 11 points behind Liverpool, who travel to Fulham on Sunday. Liverpool need just 11 points from their remaining eight games to secure a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title and first since 2020. With just two wins in their last six league matches, Arsenal have tamely surrendered in the title race and are destined to go another year without their first English crown since 2004. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta had said the best preparation for his side's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Real Madrid would be to win at Goodison Park. But the Spaniard showed he had one eye on the visit of the European champions with his team selection. Bukayo Saka was forced to wait for his first start since December as the England international was left on the bench alongside Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Martinelli, Jurrien Timber and Thomas Partey. ""This is a very tough place to come, a team who is very physical and direct. If you don't deal with it, it's hard to get momentum. The start of the second half was very poor,"" Arteta said.

Trump introduced additional 34 percent tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most US trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54 percent. Trump also closed a trade loophole that had allowed low-value packages from China to enter the US duty-free. This prompted retaliation from China on Friday, including extra levies of 34 percent on all US goods and export curbs on some rare earths, escalating the trade war between the world's two largest economies. Global stock markets plummeted following China's retaliation and Trump's comments on Friday that he would not change course, extending sharp losses that followed Trump's initial tariff announcement earlier in the week and marking the biggest losses since the pandemic.

""We believe that our security interests are aligned,"" Modi said during a televised ceremony from Dissanayake's office in the capital. ""Our security is interdependent and interconnected."" A five-year defence cooperation agreement provides training of Sri Lankan military personnel in India as well as information and technology sharing. Dissanayake applauded what he called ""India's rise as a world power, not just a regional power."" ""I have reiterated our position to Prime Minister Modi that Sri Lankan territory will not be allowed to be used by anyone to undermine India's security,"" he added. On Saturday, Dissanayake welcomed Modi – the first foreign dignitary to visit Colombo since the leftist leader swept to power last year – with a 19-gun salute. The two leaders also celebrated the start of construction of a 120-megawatt solar power project, developed as a joint venture between the two nations. The solar plant, located in the island's northeastern Trincomalee district, had been stalled for years but was reinvigorated with New Delhi's backing. Modi's visit to Sri Lanka followed a summit in Thailand and a string of meetings with leaders of neighbouring nations as he sought to shore up India's regional ties.

The March 28 quake flattened buildings and destroyed infrastructure across the country, resulting in 3,354 deaths and 4,508 people injured, with 220 others missing, according to new figures published by state media. More than one week after the disaster, many people in the country are still without shelter, either forced to sleep outdoors because their homes were destroyed or wary of further collapses. A United Nations estimate suggests that more than three million people may have been affected by the 7.7-magnitude quake, compounding previous challenges caused by four years of civil war. The UN's top aid official on Saturday met with victims in the central Myanmar city of Mandalay – situated close to the epicentre and now grappling with severe damage across the city. ""The destruction is staggering,"" Tom Fletcher wrote in a post on X. ""The world must rally behind the people of Myanmar."" The new toll was announced after the country's military junta chief Min Aung Hlaing returned from a rare foreign trip to a regional summit in Bangkok on Friday, where he met with leaders including the prime ministers of Thailand and India. The general's attendance at the summit courted controversy, with protesters at the venue displaying a banner calling him a ""murderer"" and anti-junta groups condemning his inclusion. His armed forces have ruled Myanmar since a 2021 coup, when they wrested power from the civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking a multi-sided conflict that has yet to be resolved. The junta has reportedly conducted dozens of attacks since the earthquake, including at least 16 since a temporary truce was announced on Wednesday, the UN said on Friday. Years of fighting have left Myanmar's economy and infrastructure in tatters, significantly hampering international efforts to provide relief since the quake. China, Russia and India were among the first countries to provide support, sending rescue teams to Myanmar to help locate survivors.

""If we look at the Well-Off Tenants Policy, it has already been implemented on those signing new tenancy agreements,"" he told an RTHK radio programme. ""There are about 4,000 households who have signed new terms and nine are well-off tenants. Among the nine, seven are paying 1.5 times the standard rent and the other two are paying twice the standard rent."" He said the society would discuss the new policy with households before September.",2025-04-05 12:44:50
RTHK,local,Retaliatory tariffs on US goods 'aim to cause pain',https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799015-20250405.htm,"A senior member of a leading national think tank says China's retaliatory tariffs on the US aim to cause pain. Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said that given the difficult trade situation, China's retaliatory measures were not gestures, saying otherwise they would be meaningless. On Friday, Beijing announced it would impose a 34 percent tariff on all US imports starting on April 10. The move was in response to US President Donald Trump's announcement on April 2 of a fresh round of tariffs targeting countries worldwide. They included a 34 percent tariff on Chinese goods in addition to the previous 20 percent levy. Washington also made no distinction between goods coming from the SAR and the mainland. In response, Lau said - apart from imposing countermeasures on Washington should Beijing request such a move - Hong Kong could also consider placing levies on US goods. Meanwhile, Terence Chong, executive director of Chinese University's Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, believes Beijing's latest round of tariffs will cause US stocks to fall further. He said a recession would likely occur in the US in the next few quarters due to inflationary concerns and the reduction in GDP caused by a decline in consumption. Chong also said the US might impose additional tariffs in response to Beijing's move, further reducing trade between the two countries.","Sat, 05 Apr 2025 11:12:23 +0800","A senior member of a leading national think tank says China's retaliatory tariffs on the US aim to cause pain.

RTHK,sport,Alex Ovechkin matches Gretzky's NHL record,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799014-20250405.htm,"Alex Ovechkin scored twice to tie Wayne Gretzky's record of 894 NHL career goals on Friday, matching a mark that once seemed unassailable. With Gretzky in attendance, the 39-year-old Russian delivered No. 894 6:32 into the third quarter to give his Washington Capitals a 4-3 lead over the Chicago Blackhawks in a game they would go on to win 5-3. Ovechkin tied Gretzky's monumental mark with a power-play goal, dropping to one knee and lifting his arms in celebration as the crowd at Capital One Arena roared. ""I'm sure everybody enjoyed this moment because it's something special,"" Ovechkin said in an in-arena interview immediately after the game. ""(To) do it at home, in front of our fans, family, friends, and obviously win here as well ... It's a huge honor."" Ovechkin also skated over and high-fived his son Sergei, with teammates coming onto the ice to congratulate him. ""It means a lot,"" Ovechkin said. ""Right now it's so emotional. You never thought, like, you can reach that milestone. ""Without all my teammates, all my partners, you guys,"" he said with a nod to fans, ""my family, my mom, my wife, you know? They support, they do everything what I need."" Needing three goals to break Gretzky's monumental mark coming into the contest, he had grabbed number 893 just 3:52 into the game. Set up at the bottom of the right faceoff circle, Ovechkin one-timed a pass from Dylan Strome past Blackhawks goaltender Spencer Knight. ""It was a good flat pass (from Strome) and I got lucky,"" Ovechkin said in a brief television interview during the first intermission. ""It hit the post and went in."" The goal gave Ovechkin his 14th 40-goal season, extending his own record. Gretzky was in attendance, and Ovechkin said after the first period that the presence of the Canadian great added to an electric atmosphere at Washington's Capital One Arena. ""Everybody's buzzing right now,"" he said. ""Wayne's here, so it's a special moment."" Fans were chanting for Ovechkin before the game started, and every time he was on the ice. A groan went up in the first period when a pass intended for Ovechkin was intercepted by a Chicago defender. Gretzky, sitting in a suite with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, also drew cheers from the crowd. The Blackhawks, trailing 4-3, pulled their goaltender, but after Ryan Leonard scored into the empty net to put the Caps up 5-3 Knight returned to his goal -- and took Ovechkin on. He stopped two attempts from the Russian for a record-breaking goal as the clock wound down, drawing boos from spectators for his trouble.

RTHK,sport,Van der Poel and Pogacar face off in Tour of Flanders,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799008-20250405.htm,"Come rain or shine 750,000 fans are expected to turn out on Sunday for cycling's most revered one-day race, the Tour of Flanders, for a Tadej Pogacar and Mathieu van der Poel showdown. The all-rounder Pogacar won the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and world championships in 2024, while Van der Poel, who is 10 kilos heavier than the Slovenian, is the most powerful one-day racer, and has multiple mountain bike and cyclocross titles. Pogacar has also confirmed he will ride the Paris-Roubaix with its 54km of cobbles and no hills in next Sunday's big one. Van der Poel won both last season. Each has seven wins in the Monuments and last time the two went head-to-head Van der Poel came out on top at Milan - San Remo in March. ""Mathieu is one of the best sprinters in the peloton,"" said the effervescent Pogacar. ""Flanders is a very different race. But if there's a sprint, I'll do my best."" While Pogacar won here in 2023, Van der Poel is one of seven men to have won it three times and could become the first to win a fourth. In this epic 270km struggle through lush Flemish plains, Van der Poel's weight might be an advantage for the distance and the 18 cobbled sections. For the slighter Pogacar, there are 17 short, punchy hills where he can exercise his devastating kick. Belgian hopes would normally rest on Wout van Aert. He has struggled to find any form since a win at the Vuelta last year but Pogacar is not ruling him out. ""Wout seems pretty good to me. He's on the pace,"" Pogacar said. ""He'll be in there on Sunday."" Denmark's Mads Pedersen and Filippo Ganna of Ineos are two other on-form riders to watch out for. First staged in 1913 the Tour of Flanders was designed to reflect the stoicism of the Flemish. The winner is often a tough, tactically-minded rider ready to give every last drop for victory. Van der Poel won the 2020, 2022 and 2024 Flanders and has twice been runner-up, but after winning the Milan - San Remo in March he picked out Pogacar as favourite for this one. ""There are many more hills here for him to attack on. It'll be hard, but then it always is,"" said the 30-year-old Dutch phenomenon. After the 114km mark, there is a cobbled hill every 8km or so, constantly whittling down the field which will start with 25 teams of seven. Each hillside in the latter part of the race is turned into a giant makeshift party pub, with beer tents and food caravans before an after-party that goes on late into the night. Pogacar said of his 2023 win he could retire happy after soloing home thanks to a series of devastating attacks. He opted not to defend his title in 2024 to target an elusive Giro-Tour double last achieved by the late Marco Pantini in 1998. There are five ultra-long one-day bike races known as the Monuments, and the Tour of Flanders is considered the greatest because of the constant steep, narrow climbs coupled with crowds that even a 100 years ago began to tip over half a million. The other four Monuments are Milan-San Remo, which calls for patience, the mudfest of Paris-Roubaix with its perilous rough-hewn cobbles, Liege-Bastogne-Liege through the winding forested lanes of the Ardennes, and the Tour of Lombardy which is a climbers' classic. Shuttle buses and extra trains have been laid on throughout Flanders for what is regarded by many as an unofficial world championship.

RTHK,international,"Tariffs to raise inflation, cool growth: Fed Chair",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798991-20250405.htm,"US President Donald Trump's tariffs risk higher unemployment and will likely cause inflation to rise and growth to slow, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday. Trump's dramatic trade measures announced earlier this week have tightened scrutiny of Powell and how the Fed will react to free falling financial markets and concerns that a prolonged trade war would ramp up consumer prices and joblessness rates. ""The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,"" Powell told an event in Virginia., adding that it was ""too soon"" to consider changes to US monetary policy. Powell spoke just minutes after Trump posted on social media, urging him to cut interest rates immediately and accusing him of playing politics in his role running the independent US central bank. The larger-than-expected tariffs unveiled on Wednesday stack on top of earlier country-specific levies, meaning that China, for example, will now face a new levy totalling 54 percent. Other top trading partners will also see higher rates, with the European Union now facing a 20 percent tariff from April 9, and India looking at a 26 percent levy. The Trump administration has also targeted specific sectors of the economy, recently slapping a 25 percent tariff on automobiles not made in the United States. Powell said Friday that he expected the current uncertainty to decline in the coming months. Powell's comments suggest the Fed is in no rush to cut its benchmark lending rate from its current elevated level of between 4.25 and 4.50 percent, as it continues its struggle to bring inflation down to its long-term two percent target. In recent months, the Fed's progress in bringing inflation down to target has stalled, while growth has remained solid and the unemployment rate has hugged close to historic lows. Faced with this data, the Fed voted last month to extend its pause in rate cuts and signalled that it wanted to see how the new administration's policies would feed through to the economy before taking any action. Fed policymakers - now including Powell - have warned that tariffs could cause prices to rise, with the extent of the price increase likely determined by the rollout of the levies and how consumers and businesses respond. Ahead of Powell's speech on Friday, Donald Trump took to his Truth Social account to insist that his tariff policy would not change despite the market reaction and called on Powell to act. ""CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!"" wrote Trump, who first nominated Powell to run the Fed, before turning against him during his first term. Speaking Friday, Powell insisted he had no plans to step down as Fed chair before his term ends next year. ""I fully intend to serve all of my term,"" he said during the Virginia event.

RTHK,international,Trump extends TikTok deadline to find buyer,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798987-20250405.htm,"US President Donald Trump on Friday extended the deadline for TikTok to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a ban in the United States, allowing 75 more days to find a solution. ""My administration has been working very hard on a deal to save TikTok, and we have made tremendous progress,"" Trump said on Truth Social, just hours before the deadline was to expire. ""A transaction requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days."" The hugely popular video-sharing app, which has well over 170 million American users, is under threat from a US law that passed overwhelmingly last year and orders TikTok to split from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, or get shut down in the United States. Trump has insisted his administration is near a deal to find a buyer for TikTok and keep it from shutting down that would involve multiple investors but has given few details. Motivated by national security fears and belief in Washington that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese government, the ban took effect on January 19, one day before Trump's inauguration. In the hours before that deadline, TikTok was temporarily shut down in the United States and disappeared from app stores, to the dismay of millions of users. But the Republican president quickly announced an initial 75-day delay, and TikTok subsequently restored service to users, returning to the Apple and Google app stores in February. The new 75-day delay pushes the deadline to June 19. The president added on Friday that he would ""continue working in good faith with China."" The president suggested TikTok could even be part of a broader deal with China to ease the stinging tariffs he imposed on Beijing as part of a worldwide blitz of levies. According to reports, the solution in the works would see existing US investors in ByteDance roll over their stakes into a new independent global TikTok company. Additional US investors, including Oracle and Blackstone, the private equity firm, would be brought on to reduce ByteDance's share. ABC News reported on Friday that Walmart was also in the mix. Uncertainty remains, particularly over what would happen to TikTok's valuable algorithm. ""TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand – it's simply not as powerful,"" said Forrester Principal Analyst Kelsey Chickering. Amazon has also reportedly made a last-minute bid to buy TikTok. Other proposals include an initiative called ""The People's Bid for TikTok"", launched by real estate and sports tycoon Frank McCourt's Project Liberty initiative. Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity recently expressed interest in buying TikTok, as did a joint venture involving YouTube mega-celebrity MrBeast and another bid from adult content platform OnlyFans.

""TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand – it's simply not as powerful,"" said Forrester Principal Analyst Kelsey Chickering. Amazon has also reportedly made a last-minute bid to buy TikTok. Other proposals include an initiative called ""The People's Bid for TikTok"", launched by real estate and sports tycoon Frank McCourt's Project Liberty initiative. Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity recently expressed interest in buying TikTok, as did a joint venture involving YouTube mega-celebrity MrBeast and another bid from adult content platform OnlyFans.

Western countries, including the United States, have long accused Iran of pursuing a nuclear weapon, which Tehran has denied, insisting its enrichment activities were solely for peaceful purposes.

Trump in his first term ripped up a 2015 nuclear deal negotiated by predecessor Barack Obama and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran. The deal, sealed between Tehran and world powers, had required Iran to limit its nuclear ambitions in exchange for sanctions relief.

Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam condemned the strike as a ""flagrant attack on Lebanese sovereignty"" and a breach of the November 27 ceasefire with Israel. ""Overnight, the (army and the domestic security agency Shin Bet) conducted a targeted strike in the Sidon area, eliminating the terrorist Hassan Farhat, commander of Hamas's western arena in Lebanon,"" the Israeli military said in a statement. It alleged that Farhat had orchestrated multiple attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians during the hostilities that followed the outbreak of war in Gaza in October 2023. They included rocket fire on the Israeli town of Safed on February 14, 2024, that killed an Israeli soldier, the military added. The strike on a flat in a residential area of Sidon killed the official and his adult son and daughter, said a Palestinian official. A witness saw the fourth-floor flat still on fire after the strike, which caused heavy damage to the apartment block and neighbouring buildings and sparked panic in the densely populated neighbourhood. Lebanese state media had reported the 3:45 am (0045 GMT) strike on Sidon, saying at least three people were killed. ""A hostile drone raided a residential apartment... causing two successive explosions that led to a fire and extensive damage,"" the state-run National News Agency reported. Emergency workers rushed to the scene where they recovered ""the bodies of three martyrs,"" NNA said. The Lebanese prime minister called for ""maximum pressure on Israel to force it to halt these continual attacks which target various districts, many of them residential areas."" Israel struck south Beirut earlier this week, killing a Hezbollah Palestinian liaison officer in only the second raid on the capital since a November ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militant group. The Lebanese health ministry reported four dead in that strike, including a woman. Lebanese leaders condemned the attack, but Israel said it was in response to recent unclaimed rocket fire that Hezbollah insists it had no hand in. Hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah spiralled into all-out conflict last September, and the group remains a target of Israeli air strikes despite the November 27 ceasefire. Under the truce, Hezbollah is supposed to redeploy its forces north of the Litani River, about 30 kilometres from the Israeli border, and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure in the south.

The Korea Coast Guard said they had found ""two tons"" of what they suspect to be pure cocaine on a Norwegian-flagged vessel which had departed from Mexico and made stops in Ecuador, Panama, and China. The operation was launched after South Korean authorities received intelligence from US agencies – the FBI and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) – that the vessel was carrying hidden narcotics. The Korea Coast Guard and Korea Customs Service coordinated a large-scale search operation ""consisting of a joint search team of 90 officers... along with two drug-sniffing dog units,"" the Korea Coast Guard said. After the vessel docked at an east coast port in South Korea, the team immediately boarded the vessel and ""discovered a hidden compartment behind the ship's engine room.""

""Preliminary field tests confirmed the substances as suspected cocaine,"" the Korea Coast Guard official said. ""The seizure is the largest in history, about five times bigger than the previous record, which was 404 kilogrammes of methamphetamine,"" said a Korea Customs Service official.

RTHK,sport,Fernandez header powers Chelsea into fourth,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798934-20250404.htm,"Chelsea climbed to fourth place in the Premier League as Enzo Fernandez sealed a 1-0 win that piled pressure on beleaguered Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou on Thursday. Fernandez's thumping header early in the second half settled a bruising London derby at Stamford Bridge. Manchester City and Newcastle had both won on Wednesday to knock Chelsea from fourth down to sixth in the race to qualify for next season's Champions League. But Chelsea's response lifted them one point clear of fifth-placed City and two ahead of sixth-placed Newcastle. The top four are guaranteed to reach the Champions League, with fifth also likely to secure a place depending on the results of the English clubs left in European competitions this season. Chelsea, who have now lost just one of their past 13 league games against Tottenham, had been far from convincing recently, with boss Enzo Maresca criticised for his cautious tactics. Beaten 1-0 at Arsenal in their last game before the international break, Chelsea's players had a planned day off cancelled by Maresca due to a poor effort shown during an informal match against one of the club's youth sides. The Blues were more dynamic against Tottenham, but still lacked a cutting edge despite holding on for a fifth win in their last six games in all competitions. For Postecoglou, it was another dispiriting loss in a wretched season that could end with his sacking. Tottenham are without a victory in their last four league matches and have won only one of their last six games in all competitions. The north Londoners are languishing in 14th place after a 16th defeat from 30 league games. The last time they finished as low as 14th was in 2003-04, while their worst final position in the Premier League era was 15th in 1993-94. Tottenham fans have grown increasingly frustrated with their side's decline, staging a series of protests against chairman Daniel Levy. They turned on Postecoglou as well during the second half, chanting ""you don't know what you're doing"" at the Australian. Tottenham's last chance of ending their 17-year trophy drought and fulfilling Postecoglou's boast that he always wins a major prize in his second season lies in the Europa League, where they face Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-finals. Chelsea almost made the perfect start inside the first minute when Trevoh Chalobah's pass reached Nicolas Jackson, whose shot was saved by Guglielmo Vicario and hit Van de Ven before bouncing off the post. The Blues were on top in the opening minutes, and Malo Gusto's blast flashed just wide from the edge of the area. Vicario had to smother the ball on the goal-line after Fernandez tried to bundle home from Cole Palmer's deflected cross. Maresca had urged Jadon Sancho to provide more cutting edge amid mounting criticism of the winger's spluttering form during his loan from Manchester United. Sancho nearly rose to Maresca's challenge with a curling effort that Vicario brilliantly tipped over. Tottenham defender Cristian Romero pushed Levi Colwill to the ground in a clash that sparked a mass confrontation on the stroke of half-time. The row seemed to fire up Chelsea, and they finally made the breakthrough in the 50th minute. Palmer's cross picked out Fernandez, and the Argentine powered his header past Vicario from five yards. When Postecoglou sent on Brennan Johnson and Pape Sarr for Wilson Odobert and Lucas Bergvall, Tottenham fans taunted the Australian with derisive chants. For a few moments, it seemed Sarr had silenced Postecoglou's critics as he drilled home from long range in the 69th minute. But the goal was disallowed by VAR for Sarr's foul on Moises Caicedo, leaving Postecoglou shaking his head in frustration. Son Heung-min was inches away from rescuing Postecoglou in the 89th minute, only for Robert Sanchez to make a superb save from the forward's close-range shot.

Manchester City and Newcastle had both won on Wednesday to knock Chelsea from fourth down to sixth in the race to qualify for next season's Champions League. But Chelsea's response lifted them one point clear of fifth-placed City and two ahead of sixth-placed Newcastle. The top four are guaranteed to reach the Champions League, with fifth also likely to secure a place depending on the results of the English clubs left in European competitions this season. Chelsea, who have now lost just one of their past 13 league games against Tottenham, had been far from convincing recently, with boss Enzo Maresca criticised for his cautious tactics. Beaten 1-0 at Arsenal in their last game before the international break, Chelsea's players had a planned day off cancelled by Maresca due to a poor effort shown during an informal match against one of the club's youth sides. The Blues were more dynamic against Tottenham, but still lacked a cutting edge despite holding on for a fifth win in their last six games in all competitions. For Postecoglou, it was another dispiriting loss in a wretched season that could end with his sacking. Tottenham are without a victory in their last four league matches and have won only one of their last six games in all competitions. The north Londoners are languishing in 14th place after a 16th defeat from 30 league games. The last time they finished as low as 14th was in 2003-04, while their worst final position in the Premier League era was 15th in 1993-94. Tottenham fans have grown increasingly frustrated with their side's decline, staging a series of protests against chairman Daniel Levy. They turned on Postecoglou as well during the second half, chanting ""you don't know what you're doing"" at the Australian. Tottenham's last chance of ending their 17-year trophy drought and fulfilling Postecoglou's boast that he always wins a major prize in his second season lies in the Europa League, where they face Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-finals. Chelsea almost made the perfect start inside the first minute when Trevoh Chalobah's pass reached Nicolas Jackson, whose shot was saved by Guglielmo Vicario and hit Van de Ven before bouncing off the post. The Blues were on top in the opening minutes, and Malo Gusto's blast flashed just wide from the edge of the area. Vicario had to smother the ball on the goal-line after Fernandez tried to bundle home from Cole Palmer's deflected cross. Maresca had urged Jadon Sancho to provide more cutting edge amid mounting criticism of the winger's spluttering form during his loan from Manchester United. Sancho nearly rose to Maresca's challenge with a curling effort that Vicario brilliantly tipped over. Tottenham defender Cristian Romero pushed Levi Colwill to the ground in a clash that sparked a mass confrontation on the stroke of half-time. The row seemed to fire up Chelsea, and they finally made the breakthrough in the 50th minute. Palmer's cross picked out Fernandez, and the Argentine powered his header past Vicario from five yards. When Postecoglou sent on Brennan Johnson and Pape Sarr for Wilson Odobert and Lucas Bergvall, Tottenham fans taunted the Australian with derisive chants. For a few moments, it seemed Sarr had silenced Postecoglou's critics as he drilled home from long range in the 69th minute. But the goal was disallowed by VAR for Sarr's foul on Moises Caicedo, leaving Postecoglou shaking his head in frustration. Son Heung-min was inches away from rescuing Postecoglou in the 89th minute, only for Robert Sanchez to make a superb save from the forward's close-range shot. (AFP)",2025-04-04 15:14:08

RTHK,local,HK manufacturers to wait-and-see amid Trump tariffs,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798915-20250404.htm,"The president of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong has voiced its strong opposition towards US President Donald Trump's latest round of levies. They were part of sweeping tariffs by the Republican leader directed at countries around the world on Thursday, including 34 percent tariff on goods from China. That's on top of the existing tax of 20 percent. Speaking on an RTHK radio programme on Friday, association chairman Wingco Lo pointed out that the move has affected the stability of global supply chains, and has damaged the international trade order. ""There are a lot of variables and uncertainties, so manufacturers do not dare to move when it comes to planning, he said. ""We will wait and see what the US is going to do. Because its policies often keep changing."" Lo noted that US firms and importers are also adopting a wait-and-see approach, and they might suspend placing an order, or doing it later than usual. In the short-run, there might be a shock effect on trade activities, he said. World leaders and businesses have expressed shock and concern by Trump's tariff barrage, with many markets taking a similar stance of not making any major moves. But Lo believes the imposition of tariffs are Trump's bargaining chip and will not last long. This is because Washington itself will also suffer from the move, especially its importers, ports, as well as retailers, according to Lo, and the measure would step up inflation and reduce consumer purchasing power. He added that Hong Kong manufacturers are encouraged to open up new markets, and set up production lines in places with low, or even no tariffs. Terence Chong, executive director of Chinese University's Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, told the same programme that while he anticipates the SAR's trade industry to suffer losses due to the levies, he expects the impact to be temporary. The situation will get better when people adapt to the reciprocal tariffs, he added.","Fri, 04 Apr 2025 12:02:33 +0800","The president of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong has voiced its strong opposition towards US President Donald Trump's latest round of levies.

RTHK,international,South Korea court upholds President Yoon's impeachment,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798910-20250404.htm,"South Korea's Constitutional Court on Friday decided to oust President Yoon Suk Yeol, upholding parliament's impeachment motion over his short-lived imposition of martial law last year that sparked the country's worst political crisis in decades. With Yoon's ouster, a presidential election is required to take place within 60 days, according to the country's constitution. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will continue to serve as acting president until the new president is inaugurated. The ruling caps months of political turmoil that have overshadowed efforts to deal with the new administration of U.S. President Donald Trump at a time of slowing growth. Separately, 64-year-old Yoon faces a criminal trial on insurrection charges. The embattled leader became the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested on January 15 but was released in March after a court cancelled his arrest warrant. The crisis was triggered by Yoon's December 3 declaration of martial law, which he has said was needed to root out ""anti-state"" elements and the opposition Democratic Party's alleged abuse of its parliamentary majority that he said was destroying the country. Yoon lifted the decree six hours later after lawmakers defied efforts by the security forces to seal off parliament and voted to reject it. Yoon has said he never intended to fully impose emergency military rule and tried to downplay the fallout, saying nobody was hurt. Months of protests have followed, and it remained unclear if the political chaos sparked by Yoon's martial law declaration will now be eased by the court ruling.

RTHK,international,Hungary to withdraw from ICC as Israeli leader visits,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798838-20250403.htm,"Hungary's government has decided to withdraw from the International Criminal Court, it said on Thursday, shortly after Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, sought under an ICC arrest warrant, arrived in the country for a state visit. Right-wing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban invited his Israeli counterpart to Budapest in November, a day after the ICC issued its arrest warrant over allegations of war crimes in Gaza, where Israel launched its offensive following an attack by Hamas-led fighters on southern Israel. Israel has rejected the accusations, which it says are politically motivated and fuelled by antisemitism. It says the ICC has lost all legitimacy by issuing the warrants against a democratically elected leader of a country exercising the right of self defence. As a founding member of the ICC, Hungary is theoretically obliged to arrest and hand over anyone subject to a warrant from the court but Orban made clear that Hungary would not respect the ruling, which he called ""brazen, cynical and completely unacceptable."" Hungary signed the ICC's founding document in 1999 and ratified it in 2001, but the law has not been promulgated. Gergely Gulyas, Orban's chief of staff, said in November that although Hungary ratified the Rome Statute of the ICC, it ""was never made part of Hungarian law,"" meaning that no measure of the court can be carried out within Hungary. On Thursday, Gulyas told state news agency MTI that the government would launch the withdrawal process later in the day. Orban had raised the prospect of Hungary's exit from the ICC after US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the court's prosecutor Karim Khan in February. ""It's time for Hungary to review what we're doing in an international organisation that is under US sanctions,"" Orban said on X in February. The bill on starting the year-long process of withdrawing from the ICC is likely to be approved by Hungary's parliament, which is dominated by Orban's Fidesz party. The Netherlands, which hosts the ICC, said that until withdrawal is complete, Hungary must still meet its duties. ""The full process to withdraw from the ICC takes about a year, during that time Hungary will have to fulfil all its obligations to the court,"" Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp told reporters on the sidelines of a Nato meeting in Brussels. Netanyahu has enjoyed strong support over the years from Hungary's Orban, an important ally who has been ready to block EU statements or actions critical of Israel in the past. ICC judges said when they issued the warrant that there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and his former defence chief were criminally responsible for acts including murder, persecution and starvation as a weapon of war as part of a ""widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza."" The Israeli campaign has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health authorities, and devastated the Gaza Strip. The Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, killed 1,200 people and saw more than 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. The ICC also issued an arrest warrant against a Hamas leader in November. His death was confirmed after the warrant was issued.

Ferrara, in his first public remarks on the scandal, laid the blame squarely at the door of Sinner's former physiotherapist Giacomo Naldi.

In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index ended the day down 1.52 percent at 22,849.81. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slid 1.31 percent to end at 8,420.14, and the Hang Seng Tech Index dropped 2.09 percent to 5,313.26. Tokyo's Nikkei briefly collapsed more than four percent, while US futures plunged with oil prices, safe haven gold hit a record high and the dollar retreated amid worries retaliatory measures will batter economies. Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said: ""President Trump walked into the Rose Garden and detonated the most aggressive trade shock the market's seen in decades. This isn't a jab – it's a full-on haymaker."" Wall Street ""had talked itself into a softer, more symbolic move. ""Instead, Trump carpet-bombed the global supply chain. ""This was a 'shock and awe' tariffs campaign, dressed up in 'reciprocity' language but designed to throttle the trade deficit through brute force."" Innes said the measures meant inflation risks had surged and economic growth expectations would be cut, with the Federal Reserve ""pinned between a hawkish rock and a deflationary hard place"". Tokyo pared its hefty drop but still ended down 2.8 percent, while Sydney, Seoul, Manila, Mumbai, Shanghai and Singapore also fell.

(AFP/Xinhua)","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 17:00:35 +0800","Equity markets tumbled on Thursday after Donald Trump delivered a ""haymaker"" blow with sweeping tariffs against US partners and rivals, fanning a global trade war that many fear will spark recessions and ramp up inflation. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index ended the day down 1.52 percent at 22,849.81. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slid 1.31 percent to end at 8,420.14, and the Hang Seng Tech Index dropped 2.09 percent to 5,313.26. Tokyo's Nikkei briefly collapsed more than four percent, while US futures plunged with oil prices, safe haven gold hit a record high and the dollar retreated amid worries retaliatory measures will batter economies. Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said: ""President Trump walked into the Rose Garden and detonated the most aggressive trade shock the market's seen in decades. This isn't a jab – it's a full-on haymaker."" Wall Street ""had talked itself into a softer, more symbolic move. ""Instead, Trump carpet-bombed the global supply chain. ""This was a 'shock and awe' tariffs campaign, dressed up in 'reciprocity' language but designed to throttle the trade deficit through brute force."" Innes said the measures meant inflation risks had surged and economic growth expectations would be cut, with the Federal Reserve ""pinned between a hawkish rock and a deflationary hard place"".

RTHK,finance,Tariffs will rebound on US: economists,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798796-20250403.htm,"The latest tariffs imposed by the United States will add to the country's own economic pains, complicate already heightened global trade and geopolitical tensions, and result in a backlash from many nations, according to economists. They were responding to US President Donald Trump's imposition of steep tariffs on imports from many countries, including 34 percent on China, 20 percent on the European Union, 46 percent on Vietnam and a baseline tariff of 10 percent for a wide range of other nations. ""Generally speaking, I do think that the tariffs imposed on all countries are definitely more than people expected, especially in some regions, even in the European Union,"" Dickie Wong, executive director of research at Kingston Securities, said in an interview with RTHK. He said the higher levies could complicate the already heightened trade tensions between the United States and almost ""every single country"" in the world, while having a negative effect on global financial markets, which plunged significantly following Trump's announcements. Wong also noted that the across-the-board tariff spikes will add to the pressures on the US Federal Reserve as it tries to reduce interest rates in the short to long term, especially now that the personal consumption expenditures price index – the Fed's preferred inflation gauge – has already shown signs of edging up. For his part, Ben Emons, chief market strategist at Strategic Fortune Wealth, said that ""what we're seeing to be playing out is that the US gross domestic product will contract even further from here [on]. ""The markets have already been very efficient to drag down the benchmark S&P 500 index by 10 percent from the peak."" He added that such declines are only the tip of the iceberg of a broader impact as the tariffs are gradually implemented and, in turn, reflected in hard data in the coming months. Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said that ""we have already revised down our growth forecast for the US currently to 1.4 percent for this year, and it's likely going to be revised down further. ""This is quite incredible because heading into Donald Trump's presidency, the US economy was in a very strong state, but within the time span of just a couple of months, he's managed to potentially undo all of that. ""That story of a strong American growth is dissipating and that will carry consequences for the rest of the world given that it's not just China but the entire Asian region that really relies on US demand as a driver of their own economic growth."" The latest tariffs are going to sting China as the 34 percent comes on top of an existing 20 percent that, when it comes into effect on April 9, will be closer to Trump’s campaign pledge of a 60 percent rate. Also among Trump's moves was an order to end duty exemptions on low-value shipments from China under the ""de minimis"" rule starting on May 2, which analysts said brings the trade war ""closer to home"", as many middle-income American households rely on the exemptions as part of daily e-commerce purchases. Noting that China was always bearing the brunt of America's trade policies, Marro said that Beijing this time must act more pro-actively in its response to such trade shocks, such as by boosting domestic consumption to offset the trade impact. ""Chinese officials need to act pro-actively respond to these shocks, not just in terms of cushioning exporters and producers, but also over what this means for reviving domestic consumption, ensuring that they can reflate the economy in ways that are sustained,"" he said. ""Domestic demand is really going to be one of the only ways for China to offset this external demand shock,"" he added. Singapore-based investment veteran Olivier d'Assier noted that Trump's tariffs will draw a backlash from many nations, as the level of increase far exceeds expectations and may not serve as the negotiation tool that the American president may have been hoping for. ""[So] if you say 10 percent or 15 percent, it gets people's attention,"" said d'Assier. ""They [the nations] come to the table, they negotiate some kind of deals. ""But if you say 30 percent, 40 percent, 54 percent, this would be unacceptable to most of these trading partners, and they will retaliate. ""And they have means to retaliate.

Tyler Herro scored 25 points to lead seven players to score in double figures for the Heat, who fought off a late Celtics surge to notch a sixth straight victory. Boston connected on just 37.2 percent of their shots in the first half in the face of stout Miami defense and Miami pushed their lead to 22 points early in the third quarter. The Celtics, led by 24 points from Jaylen Brown, cut the deficit to three, but Miami had pushed it back to 10 entering the fourth quarter. After the Celtics pulled within four early in the final frame the Heat relentlessly pulled away again. The victory solidified Miami's position in the Eastern Conference play-in while the Celtics fell five games behind the Cavaliers atop the conference with six games left in the regular-season. Donovan Mitchell scored 27 points and Jarrett Allen added 21 on impressive 10-of-11 shooting for the Cavs, who rallied from an early 15-point deficit to beat the Knicks 124-105 in Cleveland. The Knicks, third in the East, were again without top scoring threat Jalen Brunson, who missed his 14th game with a sprained ankle. Even without him the Knicks were on a three-game winning streak, but after leading by as many as 15 points on the way to a 60-53 halftime lead New York ran out of gas. New York's OG Anunoby made five of six from three-point range on the way to 19 first-half points, but scored just four in the second half. Karl-Anthony Towns led the Knicks with 25 points and 13 rebounds, but after closing the first half on a 10-2 scoring run the Cavaliers out-scored the Knicks 38-25 in the third quarter to seize control. ""We didn't put our best foot forward at the start,"" Mitchell said. ""We came out kind of sloppy. For the rest of the game, the last three quarters, we did what we were supposed to do."" Mitchell added six rebounds, five assists and three of Cleveland's five blocked shots. ""Just trying to do everything I can to win,"" he said. The Knicks remained three games ahead of the fourth-placed Indiana Pacers, who were fueled by 22 points and 10 assists from Tyrese Haliburton in a 110-105 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. The top six finishers in each conference qualify automatically for the playoffs, while the seventh- through 10th-placed teams will battle through the play-in tournament for the final two spots.

The Knicks, third in the East, were again without top scoring threat Jalen Brunson, who missed his 14th game with a sprained ankle. Even without him the Knicks were on a three-game winning streak, but after leading by as many as 15 points on the way to a 60-53 halftime lead New York ran out of gas. New York's OG Anunoby made five of six from three-point range on the way to 19 first-half points, but scored just four in the second half. Karl-Anthony Towns led the Knicks with 25 points and 13 rebounds, but after closing the first half on a 10-2 scoring run the Cavaliers out-scored the Knicks 38-25 in the third quarter to seize control. ""We didn't put our best foot forward at the start,"" Mitchell said. ""We came out kind of sloppy. For the rest of the game, the last three quarters, we did what we were supposed to do."" Mitchell added six rebounds, five assists and three of Cleveland's five blocked shots. ""Just trying to do everything I can to win,"" he said. The Knicks remained three games ahead of the fourth-placed Indiana Pacers, who were fueled by 22 points and 10 assists from Tyrese Haliburton in a 110-105 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. The top six finishers in each conference qualify automatically for the playoffs, while the seventh- through 10th-placed teams will battle through the play-in tournament for the final two spots. Elsewhere, the Houston Rockets clinched their first playoff spot in five years in emphatic style, beating the league-worst Utah Jazz 143-105. (AFP)",2025-04-03 11:35:46

RTHK,finance,Tariffs target packages under US$800 from HK,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798734-20250403.htm,"US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that closes a trade exemption known as ""de minimis"" that has allowed low-value packages from mainland China and Hong Kong to enter the United States, free of duties. Trump signed the order, which takes effect on May 2, in the Rose Garden of the White House after announcing sweeping new tariffs on global trading partners. The White House said the move came after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick certified ""adequate systems are in place to collect tariff revenue"" on the shipments. It said imported goods from mainland China and Hong Kong sent outside the international postal network and valued at or under US$800 would now be subject to all applicable duties. Imported goods sent through the postal network and valued at or under US$800 would now be subject to a duty rate of either 30 percent of their value or US$25 per item, with that rate increasing to US$50 per item after June 1. Trump had signed an initial order on February 1 ending duty-free entry for the cheap Chinese goods, but later paused the order because of logistical issues complicating the inspection of millions of the low-value shipments. The number of shipments entering the US through the duty-free route has exploded in recent years, reaching nearly 1.4 billion packages last year. More than 90 percent of all packages coming into the US now enter via de minimis, and of those, about 60 percent come from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein. Trump's order affecting de minimis parcels was paused on February 7 because there had not been sufficient time to prepare, with packages stacking up at ports of entry. The White House said carriers transporting the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong postal items must ""report shipment details to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), maintain an international carrier bond to ensure duty payment, and remit duties to CBP on a set schedule."" It said CBP may require formal entry for any postal package instead of the specified duties. The White House said the commerce secretary would submit a report within 90 days assessing the order’s impact and considering whether to extend these rules to packages from Macau.

Record 31-time winners Barca had the better of the clash at the Metropolitano stadium after the wild 4-4 first leg draw, and defeat leaves Diego Simeone's Atlético with little to play for in the rest of the season. By contrast the Catalans are on the hunt for a potential quadruple and are unbeaten in 2025, stretching their run to 21 games without defeat. Atlético were the last team to triumph against Barcelona, winning before Christmas to go top of La Liga, but they now trail Hansi Flick's team by nine points with nine matches remaining. ""We can't relax, we have to keep believing and working, with humility and I'm sure good things will come,"" Torres said. ""If a final is already a huge motivation, imagine playing against your most direct rival."" Flick brought winger Raphinha back into Barcelona's starting line-up and the hosts tried to shut him down through fair means or foul. César Azpilicueta was booked for one tackle, surviving a VAR review for a potential red card, while Rodrigo de Paul was also cautioned for going in hard on the Brazilian. Teenage winger Lamine Yamal ran the show on the other flank for Barcelona, firing wide and teeing up Jules Kounde, who bypassed Robin Le Normand with some neat juggling before lashing over. The 17-year-old played in Torres for Barcelona's opener with a well-weighted pass, finished clinically by the former Manchester City forward, who has earned more minutes with his recent performances. Yamal mishit a shot himself from a good position in the box, while Atlético goalkeeper Juan Musso denied Raphinha at his near post. Simeone brought on Alexander Sorloth among three changes at the break, after he scored three goals in the three previous meetings between these sides this season. Perhaps convinced he would make it four in four, Sorloth fired narrowly wide early in the second half with Antoine Griezmann open and ready for a simple finish. At the other end, Raphinha forced another save from Musso but was himself guilty of not squaring for Fermín López. Sorloth rattled home what he thought for a few seconds was an equaliser, but he had strayed offside. With Atlético ascendant, Flick brought on top goalscorer Robert Lewandowski for Torres, but the Polish veteran struggled to get involved.

Under the watchful eyes of Jurgen Klopp, the new head of global soccer for Leipzig's owners Red Bull, the visitors were outclassed by a strong Stuttgart side. Goals from Angelo Stiller, Nick Woltemade and Jamie Leweling took Stuttgart to victory, putting them on track for a first German Cup triumph since 1997. The victory continues Stuttgart's rise since former Leipzig youth-team coach Sebastian Hoeness took over in April 2023. ""We're going to Berlin,"" Hoeness said. ""Unbelievable. The lads are unbelievable, it's incredible. It's a dream to travel to Berlin."" ""We rewarded ourselves with goals at the right moment and when we needed to we defended with passion,"" he added. The coach ended his post-match interview early before sprinting across the field to have his picture taken with the rest of the squad in front of the club's ecstatic home fans. Hoeness has become one of the most sought-after coaches in Europe, having led Stuttgart from relegation candidates to runners-up last season, and now the German Cup final. The five-time German champions and three-time cup winners will be heavy favourites in Berlin in May, against a Bielefeld side who stunned holders Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday. Leipzig, winners of two of the past three German Cups, had a chaotic lead-up to the match. On Sunday, the Saxons fired coach Marco Rose, who led them to the trophy two seasons ago, replacing him with interim boss Zsolt Low. Klopp, a close friend of Rose who brought him to the club while coaching Mainz in 2002 but who signed off on Sunday's decision, was spotted watching on from the stands on Wednesday. Stiller put the hosts on track five minutes in, smacking home an unstoppable volley from outside the box to give Stuttgart the lead. Leipzig were stunned but took control soon after. Visiting striker Lois Openda was kept at bay despite three clear chances between the 15 and 35-minute marks. Woltemade doubled Stuttgart's lead 12 minutes into the second half, sliding the ball under the goalkeeper after a clever one-two with Ermedin Demirovic. Leipzig hit back almost immediately when Sesko hammered in with 62 minutes gone after beating the offside trap. The visitors were in the ascendancy and an equaliser looked likely until Woltemade headed goalwards from a Stiller cross, with the ball bouncing to Leweling who tapped in from two yards out. Three-time winners Stuttgart have not qualified for the final since 2013, when they lost to a treble-bound Bayern, and last won in 1997. Founded in 2009 and promoted to the top flight for the first time in 2016, Leipzig had previously won four from four German Cup semi-finals.

The move follows on rules issued last year by state planner the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to strengthen the integration of new energy vehicles with the grid amid concerns the rapid adoption of EVs would overwhelm the generation and transmission systems. The majority of the 30 projects in cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou are vehicle-to-grid or V2G, according to the announcement by the NDRC and energy regulator. Cars would act as batteries, storing power and sending it back into the grid. Grid-connected cars could also adjust their charging times to avoid peak periods and provide critical services such as frequency regulation. Providing those services could potentially become an alternative revenue stream for homeowners or operators of charging stations. According to the notice, power grid companies are responsible for setting up the pilots, and provincial governments should lead the development of charging facilities.

Curry, the NBA's all-time leader in three-point shooting, once again demonstrated his long-range prowess, draining 12-of-20 attempts from outside the arc at Memphis's FedExForum. The 37-year-old's dazzling shooting performance helped the Warriors vault over the Grizzlies into fifth place in the Western Conference standings, edging them closer to an automatic playoff berth. The Warriors improved to 44-31 while the Grizzlies dropped to sixth place with a 44-32 record. The top six finishers in the West qualify automatically for the postseason. Curry's masterpiece – his second 50-point game of the season and the 15th of his career – was backed by a triple from defensive linchpin Green and 27 points from Jimmy Butler. Green finished with 13 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists. Warriors coach Steve Kerr lavished praise on Curry's virtuoso display that has left Golden State firmly on course for the playoffs. ""The guy's 37 years old, it's incredible,"" Kerr said. ""Fifty-two points with people draped all over him all game long. The conditioning, the skill, the audacity, the belief, it's incredible to watch Steph at work. ""I can't believe he's still doing this at this age. But he's put the work in and he's still got it.""

""In the first quarter we had a specific strategy that we do not want him to get three-point shots – and he found a way to get going anyway. It's very hard to stop a player of that caliber,"" he added. ""Once he gets into that zone, it's very difficult to get him,"" he continued. ""I mean, we're talking about the best movement shooter of all time."" Memphis, who trailed by as many as 17 points in the first quarter, were left ruing their inability to sustain a second-half rally which saw them open up a four-point lead with just under four minutes remaining. Ja Morant led the Grizzlies' scoring with 36 points while Jaren Jackson Jr. added 22. ""Everybody's hurting in that locker room right now,"" Iisalo said.

The Suns are now in 11th place in the West with a 35-41 record, trailing the 10th-placed Sacramento Kings (36-39). Teams ranked 7th to 10th in the conference standings advance to a four-team play-in tournament that determines the final two playoff tickets. Meanwhile, the Indiana Pacers became the latest team to clinch their playoff place after the Atlanta Hawks slumped to a 127-113 home defeat to the Portland Trail Blazers.

""It really hurts when you put everything on the line and you come up a little short. But that's life, that's sports."" Elsewhere, Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 37 points as the Milwaukee Bucks snapped a four-game losing streak with a 133-123 victory over the Phoenix Suns. Devin Booker scored 39 points for Phoenix but it was not enough to prevent the Suns from falling to a fourth consecutive defeat – a late-season mini-slump that has imperiled their playoff hopes. The Suns are now in 11th place in the West with a 35-41 record, trailing the 10th-placed Sacramento Kings (36-39). Teams ranked 7th to 10th in the conference standings advance to a four-team play-in tournament that determines the final two playoff tickets. Meanwhile, the Indiana Pacers became the latest team to clinch their playoff place after the Atlanta Hawks slumped to a 127-113 home defeat to the Portland Trail Blazers. The result ensured that the Pacers, fourth in the Eastern Conference with a 44-31 record, are guaranteed a top-six finish. (AFP)",2025-04-02 11:47:07

RTHK,sport,Bielefeld shock holders Leverkusen in German Cup,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798544-20250402.htm,"German Cup holders Bayer Leverkusen suffered a shock 2-1 elimination at Arminia Bielefeld in the semi-finals of the competition. Xabi Alonso's side were heavily favoured to reach their second successive final but were outclassed from start to finish by their underdog opponents. Jonathan Tah's 17th-minute goal was cancelled out by a Marius Woerl strike for the hosts three minutes later. Maximilian Grosser's goal in first-half stoppage time would prove the difference for Bielefeld, who have now beaten four top-division opponents on their way to the final. Bielefeld, who have never made a German Cup final, became just the fourth third-division team to reach the showpiece event. Should Bielefeld win in Berlin in May – they will face either RB Leipzig or Stuttgart – the club will be rewarded with a Europa League spot next season. ""We didn't need luck at all because we were on the front foot the whole time,"" home coach Michel Kniat said. Kniat said he ""normally wouldn't have a drink with the players, but tonight I'll make an exception"", adding that ""nobody will go to sleep in this city tonight"". Leverkusen's Robert Andrich said it was ""by far our worst game of the season"" and added that ""Bielefeld deserved the win tonight, which means we did plenty of things wrong"". Leverkusen coach Alonso came into the game having never lost in 10 matches in the competition and needed just one more victory to beat Louis van Gaal's all-time record set as Bayern Munich manager. Everything seemed to go according to plan when Leverkusen took the lead after 17 minutes, Tah tapping in unmarked at the far post. The hosts hit back almost immediately however, Woerl taking advantage of a sloppy clearance attempt by Piero Hincapie to curl the ball home. As the half wore on, Leverkusen were unable to make their possession count, with Bielefeld fast and threatening on the counter. The hosts once again caught Leverkusen napping to take the lead moments before halftime, Grosser hammering in a Louis Oppie free kick from close range. Bielefeld continued to out-energise their opponents, fighting in the duels and giving Leverkusen few chances to drag themselves back into the game. Patrick Schick, so often Leverkusen's late hero over the past two seasons, had a chance to level the scores while unmarked after 81 minutes but hit a header against the post. This year's German Cup is one of the more open in recent memory, with recent champions Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Eintracht Frankfurt all suffering early eliminations from the competition. On Wednesday, RB Leipzig play away at Stuttgart in the other semi-final. Leipzig, who have won two of the past three German Cups, will be managed by interim coach Zsolt Low, who took over after Marco Rose was sacked on Sunday.

RTHK,sport,Real Madrid hold Real Sociedad in eight-goal thriller,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798540-20250402.htm,"Real Madrid edged into the Copa del Rey final with a thrilling 4-4 draw against Real Sociedad after extra-time, securing a 5-4 aggregate semi-final victory. Antonio Rudiger decided the pulsating tie with a header in the 115th minute, with Madrid to face Barcelona or Atletico Madrid in the final. Real Sociedad, trailing 1-0 from the first leg, took the lead through Ander Barrenetxea, but Endrick's fine chip pulled the 20-time winners level. A David Alaba own goal and Mikel Oyarzabal's deflected effort helped La Real open up a lead on the Spanish champions but Madrid battled back with goals from Jude Bellingham and Aurelien Tchouameni. Oyarzabal grabbed his second in stoppage time to force extra-time but his side could not hold off Madrid until penalties, with Rudiger's header the final word. ""I'm very happy because it was a really hard game with many comebacks and in the end my goal,"" Rudiger said. ""For me (the goal) was easy, (I made a) good movement, the corner was very good and because of that we're in the final,"" he added. ""It's a hard season but we're in another final and we will win it."" Ancelotti brought Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo Goes back into his starting lineup, leaving Kylian Mbappé on the bench to rest, with Endrick taking his place in an all-Brazilian attack. The 18-year-old wonderkid striker who netted the only goal in the first leg, was active in the opening phases, sending a dangerous overhead kick narrowly wide of Álex Remiro's far post. Bellingham also threatened for the hosts but it was Real Sociedad who took the lead. Barrenetxea broke in behind Lucas Vázquez to reach Pablo Marin's flick-on and drilled a low finish home to put the Basques level in the tie. Real Madrid soon found their equaliser. Vinicius played a sensational through ball down the left flank with the outside of his foot, sending Endrick in on goal. The youngster, top scorer in the Copa del Rey, produced a gorgeous lobbed finish over Romero for his fifth in the competition. Real Sociedad appealed for a penalty before the break when Takefusa Kubo went down in the box after being held by Vinicius, but the referee did not concur. Ancelotti brought on Mbappé for Endrick, looking for a goal to shut the tie down for good. However, it was the visitors who were creating the better chances. Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin made a superb save to deny Martin Zubimendi and Oyarzabal wastefully fired the rebound wide. Real Sociedad moved ahead on the night when Alaba deflected Marin's cross through Lunin's legs and into his own net after 72 minutes. The Austrian defender, who returned from a long-term injury in January, was also involved in Real Sociedad's third, deflecting Oyarzabal's shot past Lunin. It sparked Madrid in to action, with Vinicius turning his marker brilliantly, driving forward and crossing for Bellingham to strike in the 82nd minute. Four minutes later and Los Blancos pulled level on the night with Tchouameni's header badly fumbled by Remiro into his own net. Just when it seemed Real Sociedad were out they managed to force extra-time, with Oyarzabal heading home Sergio Gómez's free-kick in the 93rd minute. Remiro saved well from Bellingham before the end of the regulation 90 minutes, with the pace slower, inevitably, as the game restarted. Real Sociedad's Jon Olagasti was booked for hacking down Vinicius as he threatened to escape on the left, with the visitors working hard to hold off the European champions. With five minutes remaining Rudiger sent Madrid through to the final with a fine header from Arda Guler's corner past the helpless Remiro.

The incident marks the first major accident involving the SU7 sedan, which Xiaomi launched last March and since December has outsold Tesla's Model 3 on a monthly basis. Xiaomi's shares, which had risen by 34.8 percent year to date, closed down 5.5 percent on Tuesday, underperforming a 0.2 percent gain in the Hang Seng Tech index. Xiaomi did not disclose the number of casualties but said initial information showed the car was in the Navigate on Autopilot (NOA) intelligent-assisted driving mode before the accident and was moving at 116kmh. A driver inside the car took over and tried to slow it down but then collided with a cement pole at a speed of 97kmh, Xiaomi said. The accident in Tongling in eastern Anhui province killed the driver and two passengers, Chinese financial publication Caixin reported on Tuesday citing friends of the victims. In a rundown of the data submitted to local police posted on a Weibo account of the company, Xiaomi said NOA issued a risk warning of obstacles ahead and its subsequent immediate takeover only happened seconds before the collision. Local media reported that the car caught fire after the collision. Xiaomi did not mention the fire in the statement. Xiaomi began manufacturing EVs last year with the launch of the SU7 sedan after selling smartphones, household appliances and smart gadgets for most of its 15-year history. The company has two versions of smart driving systems on its SU7 EVs. The higher-end LiDAR-mounted version, as opposed to the pure vision version, enables urban navigation features such as collision avoidance and special vehicle recognition.

The Chinese embassy in the US also condemned the sanctions. ""The Chinese central government resolutely supports the law enforcement and judicial authorities of the Hong Kong SAR in carrying out their duties in accordance with the law and punishing acts that undermine national security,"" the embassy said in a statement. ""We urge the US side to respect the facts, stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and interfering in China's internal affairs, and stop smearing Hong Kong's democracy and rule of law.""",2025-04-01 10:42:40
RTHK,greater_china,China calls for Ukraine peace talks to continue,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798386-20250401.htm,"A peace agreement on ending the conflict in Ukraine should be fair, binding and acceptable to all parties involved, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in remarks published on Tuesday. ""We advocate eradicating the causes of the crisis through dialogue and negotiations, ultimately achieving a fair, long-term, binding peace agreement acceptable to all parties involved, which would make it possible to achieve truly lasting peace and stability in Eurasia and throughout the world,"" Wang told the Russian RIA state news agency in an interview. Wang is on a three-day visit to Moscow for strategic cooperation talks, surrounded by uncertainty around the partial ceasefire in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump striking a critical tone against the Russian and Ukrainian leaders. China calls for the peace talks to continue, Wang told RIA in a wide-ranging interview. ""The step towards peace, although not that big, is constructive - it's worth building on it,"" Wang said. ""With peace, it is no pain no gain. You need to work hard to achieve it."" Wang also said Russia and the United States had taken the first step toward normalising relations, ""which is good for stabilising the balance of power between major powers and inspires optimism in a disappointing international situation"". China and Russia declared a ""no limits"" strategic partnership days before Russian President Vladimir Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022. The Kremlin said on Monday that Putin would receive Wang, who would also hold talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov. Wang reiterated to RIA that Beijing is ready to play a role in settling the conflict in Ukraine. ""China is ready, taking into account the aspirations of the parties involved, to play a constructive role in the settlement together with the international community, primarily with the countries of the Global South,"" Wang said. Xi has been pushing for a greater involvement of China in peace talks since the early days of the war, which marked its third anniversary in February. Beijing has proposed on its own, and together with Brazil, general principles to end the conflict. Wang said Russia and China bear a special responsibility to maintain world peace. ""Our countries, as each other's largest neighbouring states, world powers and permanent members of the UN Security Council, bear a special responsibility for maintaining peace and development throughout the world,"" Wang said.
