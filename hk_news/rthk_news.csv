RTHK,international,Palestinian president Abbas urges release of hostages,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801566-20250423.htm,"Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas urged the militant group Hamas on Wednesday to release the hostages still being held in Gaza, calling it the main factor fuelling Israeli attacks on the territory. ""Hamas has given the criminal occupation excuses to commit its crimes in the Gaza Strip, the most prominent being the holding of hostages,"" Abbas said at a meeting in Ramallah. ""I'm the one paying the price, our people are paying the price, not Israel. My brother, just hand them over."" ""Every day there are deaths. Why? Because they (Hamas) refuse to hand over the American hostage,"" said the Palestinian leader, referring to Edan Alexander, who was reportedly on a list of hostages Israel had asked to be freed in a proposal that was recently rejected by Hamas. ""You sons of dogs, hand over what you have and get us out of this"" ordeal, he added, levelling a harsh Arabic epithet at Hamas. Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official, condemned Abbas's remarks, calling them ""insulting."" ""Abbas continues to describe a significant and integral part of his own people using derogatory language,"" Naim said. ""Abbas repeatedly and suspiciously lays the blame for the crimes of the occupation and its ongoing aggression on our people."" Ties between Abbas' Fatah party and Hamas have been marked by deep political and ideological divisions for nearly two decades. Abbas and his Palestinian Authority have often accused Hamas of undermining Palestinian unity, while Hamas has criticised the president for collaborating with Israel and cracking down on dissent in the West Bank.

RTHK,international,"Apple, Meta fined by EU for breaking competition rules",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801548-20250423.htm,"Apple was fined 500 million euros (US$570 million) on Wednesday and Meta 200 million euros, as European Union antitrust regulators handed out the first sanctions under landmark legislation aimed at curbing the power of Big Tech. The EU fines could stoke tensions with US President Donald Trump who has threatened to levy tariffs against countries that penalise American firms. They follow a year-long investigation by the European Commission, the EU executive, into whether the companies comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) that seeks to allow smaller rivals into markets dominated by the biggest companies. Apple said it would challenge the EU fine. ""Today's announcements are yet another example of the European Commission unfairly targeting Apple in a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free,"" Apple said in an emailed statement. Meta also criticised the EU decision. ""The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards,"" it said in an emailed statement. ""This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model, effectively imposing a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service."" The fines are modest compared to the penalties meted out by the previous EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager during her term. Sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said this is due to the short period of the breaches, a focus on compliance rather than sanctions and a desire to avoid possible retaliation from Trump. The EU competition watchdog said Apple must remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent app developers from steering users to cheaper deals outside the App Store. It said Meta's pay-or-consent model introduced in November 2023 breached the DMA. The model gives Facebook and Instagram users who consent to be tracked a free service that is funded by advertising revenues. Alternatively, they can pay for an ad-free service. Meta is discussing with the EU a new version introduced in November last year. The companies have two months to comply with the orders or risk daily fines. Apple avoided a fine in a separate investigation into its browser options on iPhones after making changes that allow users to switch to a rival browser or search engine more easily. Regulators said these comply with the DMA and closed the investigation on Wednesday. The iPhone maker was still charged with breaching DMA rules on the grounds it hindered users from sideloading, a practice that involves downloading alternative app stores and apps from the web. Regulators criticised Apple's conditions, which include a new fee called Apple's Core Technology Fee, saying these serve as a disincentive for developers to use alternative app distribution channels on its mobile operating system iOS. The EU regulator also dropped Meta's Marketplace's designation as a DMA gatekeeper because the number of users fell below the required threshold. ""We have taken firm but balanced enforcement action against both companies, based on clear and predictable rules. All companies operating in the EU must follow our laws and respect European values,"" EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera said. EU lawmaker Andreas Schwab urged the Commission to maintain its investigations against Google's lucrative adtech business and Elon Musk's X and not delay decisions. ""There can be no leeway in enforcement as this may also impact the importance of competition policy in general,"" he said, adding a decision that was apparently linked to trade policy issues was ""dangerous for the whole European Union construction"".

Rounding out the effects of all one-off relief measures given by the government, the composite consumer price index, or the underlying inflation rate, stood at 1 percent last month. That was also smaller than the 1.3 percent rise recorded in the first two months of the year. While prices for electricity, gas and water saw the biggest increase, jumping 14 percent, that of clothing and footwear dropped the most, 2.8 percent. Looking ahead, a government spokesperson said Hong Kong's overall inflation should remain modest in the short term with external price pressures ""broadly in check"" but noted that escalating trade conflicts could be a concern.","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 18:07:30 +0800","Hong Kong's inflation remained moderate in March, with the overall consumer price index rising by 1.4 percent year on year.

In a statement, the department said these changes, approved by the Drinking Water Safety Advisory Committee, are aimed at enhancing public health safeguards and ensuring safe and reliable drinking water for the public. Meanwhile, tetrachloroethene and uranium will transition from routine testing to a surveillance list for periodic oversight, following years of consistently low detection levels. Similarly, tests will no longer be made for antimony under the Enhanced Water Quality Monitoring Programme with water samples collected showing traces for the chemical as being below the reporting limit.

RTHK,local,Lawmakers call for rise in income thresholds for MPF,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801512-20250423.htm,"A unionist called on Wednesday for adjustments to income levels for mandatory provident fund (MPF) contributions so people can enjoy better protection upon retirement. Lawmaker Kingsley Wong, who's also chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions, said that can be achieved by adjusting the minimum and maximum levels of income on which MPF contributions are based. These levels, he pointed out, have remained unchanged at HK$7,100 and HK$30,000 respectively for more than 10 years. Wong suggested the income range at which contributions become mandatory be raised to between HK$10,250 and HK$50,000. At present, those earning less than the minimum threshold per month do not have to make MPF contributions. This is despite the latest government data showing that workers' median monthly salary now stands at HK$20,500, Wong said. He said adjusting the income levels is crucial in terms of retirement protection. ""Based on our calculations, because our contributions for MPF are quite low, they are only sufficient to cover one third of the amount needed after retirement,"" Wong said. ""We will need to rely on other kinds of subsidies to fill the gap. ""If we can adjust the relevant income levels, it will be a great help."" Lam Chun-sing, lawmaker and chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, called on the government to make MPF contributions for low-income and grassroots workers as soon as possible. He pointed out that by adjusting the income levels, even though more low-income workers can be exempted from making mandatory contributions, this would mean that they enjoy less protection for retirement. Lam believes the government would be able to shoulder the additional costs, as the number of low-income individuals earning less than HK$10,000 a month is low, he added. Separately, Lam said the proposal to allow people to transfer the entire MPF amounts to a new scheme provider once per year is good for workers. ""If they can choose their own investment plan, [as] trustees also want to attract them to make investment in their funds, so there's competition,"" he said. ""And through market forces, [it will] encourage the trustees to improve their investment performance and lower their administrative fees, and that will benefit employees.""

In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng index jumped 510.30 points, or 2.37 percent, to close at 22,072.62, its highest since April 3. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 2.08 percent, while the Hang Seng Tech Index surged 3.07 percent. Global markets, already upended by a trade war, were battered further at the start of the week by fears the US president was looking to remove central bank boss Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates, calling him a ""major loser"" and ""Mr Too Late"". Observers warned such a move would have dealt a blow to the Fed's independence and sparked a crisis of confidence in the world's top economy, sparking a sell-off of US assets and another global crisis. However, Trump looked to temper those fears on Tuesday, saying: ""I have no intention of firing him"". ""I would like to see him be a little more active in terms of his idea to lower interest rates – it's a perfect time to lower interest rates,"" he said. ""If he doesn't, is it the end? No."" The remarks gave a much-needed shot of relief to investors, helped by the president's comments later indicating a more conciliatory approach to the trade war with China. Washington has imposed tariffs of 145 percent on a range of products from China, while Beijing has replied with 125 percent duties on imports from the United States. But Trump acknowledged on Tuesday that the US levies were at a ""very high"" level, and that this will ""come down substantially"". ""They will not be anywhere near that number,"" he said, but added that ""it won't be zero"". That came after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told a closed-door event in Washington that he expected a de-escalation soon in the United States' tariff standoff with China, which he said was not sustainable. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said later, ""the president and the administration are setting the stage for a deal"", noting that ""the ball is moving in the right direction"". President Xi Jinping also warned on Wednesday that tariff and trade wars ""undermine the legitimate rights and interests of all countries, hurt the multilateral trading system, and impact the world economic order"".

The comments came as the world's two largest economies remain in a stand-off over tariff disputes, although US President Donald Trump indicated that the levies on China will not remain at 145 percent. Speaking in a statement, the carrier noted that its cargo business saw strong growth last month. However, it cautioned that the latest developments on trade tariffs are creating uncertainties and might cause disruptions. “We expect a softening of general air cargo demand between the Chinese mainland and the United States due to the ongoing tariff situation and de minimis rule changes from early May,"" said Lavinia Lau, the group's chief customer and commercial officer. ""We are taking proactive steps to put ourselves in the best possible position in facing and mitigating these external forces as we remain aligned, agile and responsive in our approach,"" Lau added. Following the axing of the de minimis rule, small parcels valued under US$800 shipped from the SAR and the mainland that were earlier exempted from American import taxes, will be subject to duties from May 2. Her remarks came as Cathay reported that its cargo transport grew by 10.6 percent year on year to 148,807 tonnes in March, while passenger numbers jumped 19.8 percent year on year to 2.25 million. Lau noted that although March marked a ""quieter month"" for the group's travel business due to the absence of long-weekend holidays in the SAR, demand for its ""premium cabins"" remained robust, thanks to various mega-events and exhibitions in the city, including Art Basel. “The Hong Kong Sevens also generated strong inbound demand to our home city, especially on many of our long-haul routes,"" Lau added.","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 16:27:36 +0800","Cathay Pacific on Wednesday said it expects air cargo demand between the mainland and the US to ""soften"" in the coming months due to tariff tensions as well as the axing of the de minimis rule.

Red-hatted cardinals, priests, candle-carrying friars and helmeted Swiss Guards walked slowly into the vast, sunlit esplanade as a male choir chanted psalms and prayers in Latin while the great bells of the basilica tolled. The body of the 88-year-old pope, who died two days ago in his rooms at the Santa Marta guesthouse after suffering a stroke, was held aloft on a wooden platform by 14 white-gloved, black-suited pallbearers. ""Dear brothers and sisters, with deep sorrow we now accompany the mortal remains of our Pope Francis to the Vatican Basilica,"" said the Irish-American cardinal Kevin Farrell at the start of the ceremony. As the coffin crossed St. Peter's Square, a crowd of several thousand broke into repeated applause – a traditional Italian sign of respect at such events. Pope Francis, who spent five weeks in hospital earlier this year being treated for double pneumonia, last appeared in public on Sunday, when he surprised pilgrims by being driven around the packed square in his white, open-topped popemobile. His body will lie in state in St. Peter's Basilica until Friday evening, allowing faithful to pay their respects. ""He's like a member of the family. Somebody very close to our hearts, somebody who made the church very accessible to everybody and inclusive to everybody,"" said Rachel Mckay, a pilgrim from Britain who was in the square. His funeral is set for Saturday and will draw heads of state and government from around the world, including US President Donald Trump, who clashed repeatedly with the pope on social issues.

The Shenzhou-20 mission is scheduled to blast off at 5.17pm on Thursday from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China, said Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the China Manned Space Agency. At the helm will be Chen Dong, a 46-year-old former fighter pilot and experienced space explorer who in 2022 became the first Chinese astronaut to spend more than 200 cumulative days in orbit. On his latest Shenzhou mission, his third, Chen said he was ""still very excited"". Said the mission commander: ""Every space journey is very unique, so I look forward to bringing in more experience and breakthroughs in the flight."" Joining Chen will be two other male astronauts, Chen Zhongrui, a 40-year-old former air force pilot, and Wang Jie, a 35-year-old former space technology engineer. ""Today, I am on the point of realising my dream of flying in space,"" said Chen Zhongrui. ""To be honest, when we first started training together, we were still a little nervous,"" he said of himself and Wang. ""Now [the three crew members] are integrated like they are a single person,"" he added. The astronauts currently aboard the Tiangong space station are scheduled to return to Earth on April 29 after completing handover procedures with the incoming crew, Lin added.

RTHK,international,Coral bleaching has hit 84pc of world's reefs,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801485-20250423.htm,"An unprecedented coral bleaching episode has spread to 84 percent of the world's reefs in an unfolding human-caused crisis that could kill off swathes of the essential ecosystems, scientists warned on Wednesday. Since it began in early 2023, the global coral bleaching event has mushroomed into the biggest and most intense on record, with reefs across the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic oceans affected. Coral turns ghostly white under heat stress and the world's oceans have warmed over the past two years to historic highs, driven by humanity's release of planet-warming greenhouse gases. Reefs can rebound from the trauma but scientists said the window for recovery was getting shorter as ocean temperatures remained higher for longer. Conditions in some regions were extreme enough to ""lead to multi-species or near complete mortality on a coral reef"", said the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This latest episode was so severe and lasting that even more resilient coral was succumbing, said Melanie McField from the Healthy Reefs for Healthy People initiative, which specialises in the Caribbean. ""If you continue to have heatwave after heatwave, it's hard to see how that recovery is going to happen,"" the veteran reef scientist said from Florida. Bleaching occurs when coral expels algae that provides not just their characteristic colour but food and nutrients, leaving them exposed to disease and possibly eventually death. Live coral cover has halved since the 1950s due to climate change and environmental damage, the International Coral Reef Initiative, a global conservation partnership, said on Wednesday. Scientists forecast that at 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, some 70 to 90 percent of the world's coral reefs could disappear – a disastrous prospect for people and the planet. Coral reefs support not just marine life but hundreds of millions of people living in coastal communities around the world by providing food, protection from storms, and liveloods through fishing and tourism. Mass coral bleaching was first observed in the early 1980s and is one of the best known and most visible consequences of steadily rising ocean temperatures caused by global warming. The latest coral bleaching event is the fourth and largest yet, and the second in a decade, exceeding the record area affected during the last episode of 2014-2017. ""From 1 January 2023 to 20 April 2025, bleaching-level heat stress has impacted 83.7 percent of the world's coral reef area"", NOAA said in its latest update on Monday. Oceans store 90 percent of the excess heat caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels, causing warmer sea temperatures, which are the leading cause of coral bleaching. The planet has already warmed at least 1.36 degrees above pre-industrial times, says the EU's climate monitor Copernicus. Scientists predict the 1.5-degree threshold could be crossed early in the next decade. At two degrees almost all corals would disappear.

RTHK,greater_china,Second op completed to retrieve Fukushima sample,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801483-20250423.htm,"A tricky operation to remove a second sample of radioactive debris from inside Japan's stricken Fukushima nuclear plant has been completed, the site operator said on Wednesday. Dangerously high radiation levels mean that removing melted fuel and other debris from the plant hit by a huge tsunami in 2011 is seen as the most daunting challenge in the decades-long decommissioning project. Around 880 tonnes of hazardous material are inside the power station – the site of one of history's worst nuclear accidents after the tsunami, which was triggered by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake. Plant operator Tepco said its second trial debris removal operation, which began just over a week ago, ""has been completed"" as of Wednesday morning. The debris was ""removed from a different location from the previous sampling location"" to better understand the material's ""characteristics and distribution"", government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi said. Trpco completed its first trial removal, using a specially developed extendible device, in November. That first sample weighing just under 0.7 grams – roughly equivalent to one raisin – was delivered to a research lab near Tokyo for analysis. ""Detailed analysis of the debris collected in the first sampling"" will inform future decommissioning work as Tepco studies how to conduct a ""full-scale removal"", Hayashi said. US nuclear expert Lake Barrett, a special adviser on the Fukushima clean-up, said removing more debris would be challenging but not impossible. ""We're going to find all of these complexities of almost a witch's brew down underneath there"" in the reactors, Barrett said. ""They've got to develop robots we've never done before. ""But the fundamentals are there for the technology to do it."" Three of Fukushima's six reactors went into meltdown in 2011 after the huge tsunami swamped the facility. In 2023, Japan began releasing into the Pacific Ocean some of the 540 Olympic swimming pools' worth of treated wastewater that had been collected at the plant. The move was endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency but China banned Japanese seafood imports as a result, and Russia later followed suit. This month China said it had found no abnormalities in seawater and marine life samples that it independently collected near the Fukushima plant in February. But Beijing indicated more tests would be needed before it lifts the ban.

RTHK,local,City's first astronaut may be set for launch next year,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801471-20250423.htm,"The national space agency said on Wednesday astronauts from Hong Kong and Macau are on track to make their inaugural space flight as early as next year in a first for the two special administrative regions. The update came close to a year after the China Manned Space Agency selected two payload specialists from Hong Kong and Macau to join its fourth batch of preparatory astronauts. News of their eligibility came as the agency announced the crew for Thursday's Shenzhou-20 launch. Speaking at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in the northeastern Gobi Desert, agency spokesman Lin Xiqiang said the SAR astronauts had carried out a number of studies and physical and psychological training according to plans. ""Since joining the batch, the astronauts from Hong Kong and Macau quickly adapted to the working and living environment, rapidly integrated into the team of astronauts, trained very hard, and all their work progress has been smooth,"" he said. ""Currently, they are conducting studies and training in professional aerospace technology. ""As payload specialists, astronauts from Hong Kong and Macau are expected to carry out their first flight mission in 2026 at the earliest,"" he said. Lin also noted that the fourth batch of 10 preparatory astronauts would continue to carry out more training based on established plans and be included as candidates to join flight crews once they qualify. Payload specialists are professional scientific researchers who are mainly responsible for conducting experiments or research. They are also responsible for overseeing daily operations in space stations with other astronauts. The Hong Kong payload specialist was selected from 80 hopefuls after the national agency announced for the first time in 2022 that it will recruit for such positions from regions such as Hong Kong and Macau.","Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:34:12 +0800","The national space agency said on Wednesday astronauts from Hong Kong and Macau are on track to make their inaugural space flight as early as next year in a first for the two special administrative regions.

Pascal Siakam scored 24 points and pulled down 11 rebounds and Tyrese Haliburton added 21 points and 12 assists for the Pacers, who saw a 15-point fourth-quarter lead slashed to two thanks to a 13-0 scoring run from the Bucks.

With nearly 1,000 exhibitors present, foreign carmakers are raring to show they can keep pace with the ultra-competitive Chinese firms that dominate the sector's electric frontier. Beijing's historic backing of EV and hybrid development has seen the domestic market flourish, with analysts considering it younger-leaning and more open to novelty. It is the world's biggest, still growing while other major markets see declines. ""Domestic growth in China is being driven by rapid adoption of electric vehicles, increasingly with intelligent-vehicle features such as autonomous-driving systems,"" a report released on the eve of the show by consultancy AlixPartners said. Auto Shanghai, which runs until May 2, will see a flurry of launches for electric, high-tech new models – luxury SUVs, saloons and multi-purpose vehicles. On Tuesday night Volkswagen, the largest foreign group operating in the country, unveiled a series of new vehicles and a driver assistance system built ""in China for China"" – its play to reverse its sliding fortunes there. ""Our biggest push in EV history begins here,"" the group's China head Ralf Brandstatter said. Exhibitors range from state-owned behemoths, start-ups such as Nio and Xpeng, tech giants with skin in the game such as Huawei, and consumer electronics-turned-car company Xiaomi. The domestic contest has undoubtedly pushed Chinese companies to develop faster and fostered innovation. On Monday, battery giant CATL announced it had developed a quicker charging model than rival BYD – one that can regain a 520-kilometre in just five minutes of charging time. Last year, China exported 6.4 million passenger vehicles, more than 50 percent above second-ranked Japan, according to AlixPartners. There are still potential roadblocks though. Nio on Tuesday said it had underestimated the difficulties of expanding into Europe, blaming logistical hurdles and noting tariffs would have an impact on price competitiveness. Tariffs will also be on the minds of foreign companies who make cars in China themselves, such as General Motors and Ford. However, exports to Russia and the Middle East have helped cushion these and other tariff impacts, AlixPartners said Tuesday. And although the levies will increase the cost of China's vehicle component exports by about 24 percent, ""this represents only about 3.8 percent of China's total auto industry production value"", it noted.

RTHK,finance,Musk to concentrate more on Tesla after results,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801443-20250423.htm,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday he would cut back significantly the time he devotes to the Trump administration from next month and spend more time running his many companies. The move comes as Musk's involvement in the so-called Department of Government Efficiency - where he has led efforts to cut federal jobs - has become a political lightning rod, fuelling unrelenting protests and vandalism at Tesla showrooms. Investors have raised concerns about Musk spending too little time managing Tesla, where sales have nosedived. ""The large slog of work necessary to get the DOGE team in place and working with the government to get the financial house in order is mostly done,"" Musk told analysts on a conference call. But he said he still intended to spend some 40 percent of his time on DOGE. Tesla shares, which had risen 4 percent in after-hours trading right before an earnings conference call began, spiked to trade up 5.5 percent on Musk's comments. The stock has nearly halved from its December peak. After market close on Tuesday, Tesla reported profitability for its core auto business that topped rock-bottom expectations and said it was on track to produce an affordable car. But the EV maker said it would have to reassess its growth forecast in three months because it was ""difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains"" and that ""changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term,"" it said. Tariff tensions add further uncertainty. Tesla has paused some China-sourced component imports after US tariffs on the country rose to 145 percent, Reuters reported. China has responded with tariffs of its own, leading Tesla to suspend new Model S and Model X orders in the country. Musk, who said on Tuesday he continued to support lower tariffs, added that Tesla was not immune to ""macro demand for cars,"" adding that economic uncertainty causes people to want to ""pause on doing a major capital purchase like a car."" ""Absent the macro issues, we don't see any reduction in demand,"" he said. But tariffs will have an outsized impact on Tesla's energy business, he said. While the stronger-than-expected margin in the first quarter - driven by lower costs - offered some relief, Tesla's auto revenue still slumped by a fifth in the period, and net profit plunged 71 percent. These metrics both missed Wall Street estimates. Musk acknowledged the blowback on the company, but brushed off concerns about brand damage hurting Tesla's first-quarter sales. Musk's recent posts on his social media site X have suggested he is slowly re-engaging with his businesses, after spending months talking only about how he was cutting government waste. But his time away from DOGE will be split between money-maker Tesla and his other companies which include SpaceX, xAI and Neuralink. ""I think more attention by Musk on Tesla is a net positive for the stock, but to see a meaningful move in the stock we would need to see a headline more like 'Musk to leave DOGE to refocus on Tesla,'"" said Shawn Campbell, adviser and investor at Camelthorn Investments, who personally holds Tesla shares. Tesla has said it plans to release a cheaper car - seen as a key catalyst for future growth - in the first half of 2025, using existing platforms and assembly lines, after scrapping plans for a brand-new, low-cost model. Tesla in its release said the launch of affordable cars was on track for the first half of the year. ""The ramp might be slower than we had hoped initially,"" Lars Moravy, the vice president for engineering, said on the call, but that there was nothing blocking Tesla from starting production within the publicized timeline. ""The models that come out in the next months will be built on our lines and will resemble in form and shape the cars we currently make. The key is they'll be affordable and you'll be able to buy one,"" Moravy added. Tesla also said the launch of a robotaxi fleet in Austin, Texas, in June remained on track. The company has been seeking regulatory approvals to that end, but there are serious concerns about safety and related litigation risks that could come with deploying unproven driverless technology on public streets. Asked about when robotaxi production would ramp up, Musk said he expected millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously by the second half of next year. Automotive gross margin for the first quarter, excluding regulatory credits, fell to 12.5 percent from 13.6 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Reuters calculations, compared with expectations of 11.8 percent, according to 21 analysts polled by Visible Alpha. The electric vehicle maker reported revenue of US$19.34 billion for the January-March quarter, compared with estimates of US$21.11 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Tesla reported earlier this month that deliveries in the January-March period slid 13 percent.

RTHK,finance,Trump says he has no intention of firing Fed chair,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801438-20250423.htm,"US President Donald Trump on Tuesday appeared to take threats to fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell off the table after days of intensifying criticisms of the central bank chief over not cutting interest rates. ""I have no intention of firing him,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday. ""I would like to see him be a little more active in terms of his idea to lower interest rates,"" he added. The de-escalation drew an immediate thumbs up from Wall Street, as equity index futures jumped by 1.8 percent on resumption of trading on Tuesday evening. Stocks, bonds and the US dollar had all slumped on Monday following an Easter holiday weekend featuring repeated attacks by Trump on Powell for not further cutting interest rates since the president resumed office in January. Meanwhile, Trump during the same question-and-answer volley with reporters expressed optimism that a trade deal with China could ""substantially"" cut tariffs, which also provided a boost for investors. He said a deal would result in ""substantially"" lower tariffs on Chinese goods, suggesting that a final deal will not ""be anywhere near"" current tariff rates. But he added that ""it won't be zero."" The broadsides were often accompanied by threatening remarks, such as last week's social media posting that Powell's termination as Fed chair ""cannot come fast enough."" Those threats spooked financial markets that view the Fed's independence as underpinning its credibility as the world's most influential central bank and a cornerstone of global financial stability. But while Trump seems to have set aside those threats for now, his criticisms of Fed rate policy remain just as pointed. ""We think that it's a perfect time to lower the rate, and we'd like to see our chairman be early or on time, as opposed to late,"" Trump said. Trump's sour grapes with Powell date back to the Republican's first term in the White House. Trump elevated Powell from a Fed Board of Governors member to the central bank's head but was soon irritated by ongoing rate increases under Powell's watch. Trump openly mused about firing Powell, but was ultimately dissuaded by his advisers. Whether Trump has the authority is unclear. Powell, for his part, insists that the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 that created the central bank will not allow it. Trump, meanwhile, has said that if he wanted Powell out, he would be gone ""real fast."" Indeed the law stipulates that the seven Fed governors, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate to staggered 14-year terms, can only be removed for ""cause"" - long thought to mean misconduct, not policy disagreement. That said, the law omits reference to limits on removal from its description of the four-year term of the Fed chair, who is one of the seven governors. Trump's harsh rhetoric also had come alongside court cases now proceeding over his firing of officials from other independent federal boards and agencies. Those are being watched closely in Fed circles as potential proxies for whether Trump has the authority to fire Fed officials long presumed to be able to pursue monetary policy free from political influence. The Fed lowered interest rates by a percentage point late last year to their current range of 4.25 percent to 4.50 percent, but has held them unchanged in the two policy meetings convened since Trump returned to the White House. Fed policymakers are concerned that the aggressive tariffs rolled out by Trump since early February could rekindle inflation they'd already found harder than expected to return to their 2 percent target. At the same time, they worry their job could be complicated further if the tariffs slow growth and drive up unemployment at the same time they are pressuring up inflation. The result is a wait-and-see posture regarding further rate cuts, though most policymakers still see some rate reductions as likely later this year. Interest rate futures traders pared bets on Fed policy easing after Trump's remarks, and now are pricing three quarter-point interest-rate cuts by year's end, versus the four seen as earlier as more likely.

But he added that ""it won't be zero."" The broadsides were often accompanied by threatening remarks, such as last week's social media posting that Powell's termination as Fed chair ""cannot come fast enough."" Those threats spooked financial markets that view the Fed's independence as underpinning its credibility as the world's most influential central bank and a cornerstone of global financial stability. But while Trump seems to have set aside those threats for now, his criticisms of Fed rate policy remain just as pointed. ""We think that it's a perfect time to lower the rate, and we'd like to see our chairman be early or on time, as opposed to late,"" Trump said. Trump's sour grapes with Powell date back to the Republican's first term in the White House. Trump elevated Powell from a Fed Board of Governors member to the central bank's head but was soon irritated by ongoing rate increases under Powell's watch. Trump openly mused about firing Powell, but was ultimately dissuaded by his advisers. Whether Trump has the authority is unclear. Powell, for his part, insists that the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 that created the central bank will not allow it. Trump, meanwhile, has said that if he wanted Powell out, he would be gone ""real fast."" Indeed the law stipulates that the seven Fed governors, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate to staggered 14-year terms, can only be removed for ""cause"" - long thought to mean misconduct, not policy disagreement. That said, the law omits reference to limits on removal from its description of the four-year term of the Fed chair, who is one of the seven governors. Trump's harsh rhetoric also had come alongside court cases now proceeding over his firing of officials from other independent federal boards and agencies. Those are being watched closely in Fed circles as potential proxies for whether Trump has the authority to fire Fed officials long presumed to be able to pursue monetary policy free from political influence. The Fed lowered interest rates by a percentage point late last year to their current range of 4.25 percent to 4.50 percent, but has held them unchanged in the two policy meetings convened since Trump returned to the White House. Fed policymakers are concerned that the aggressive tariffs rolled out by Trump since early February could rekindle inflation they'd already found harder than expected to return to their 2 percent target. At the same time, they worry their job could be complicated further if the tariffs slow growth and drive up unemployment at the same time they are pressuring up inflation. The result is a wait-and-see posture regarding further rate cuts, though most policymakers still see some rate reductions as likely later this year. Interest rate futures traders pared bets on Fed policy easing after Trump's remarks, and now are pricing three quarter-point interest-rate cuts by year's end, versus the four seen as earlier as more likely.

RTHK,sport,PSG draw with Nantes to stay unbeaten in Ligue 1,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801437-20250423.htm,"Paris Saint-Germain were held to a 1-1 draw at Nantes in a rearranged Ligue 1 game, a result which maintains their unbeaten domestic record this season with the Champions League semi-final against Arsenal on the horizon. It looked like Vitinha's first-half strike might be enough for PSG, who have already secured a fourth consecutive Ligue 1 title, to leave the Stade de la Beaujoire with the victory. However, Nantes hit back to equalise with six minutes remaining through their Brazilian midfielder Douglas Augusto, earning the hosts a precious point in their battle for survival. PSG might still have won the game at the death, but a header by substitute Goncalo Ramos from a Desire Doue cross came back off the crossbar. Nevertheless, the draw means they have still not lost a game against domestic opposition since May last year, and leaves them just four Ligue 1 matches away from becoming the first team ever to complete a French top-flight campaign without losing. The closest a team has ever come to doing that remains Nantes, who went undefeated through their first 32 matches before suffering their only loss on the way to becoming champions in the 1994 to 1995 season. This Nantes team are now four points clear of the relegation zone with four games to play, and three of their remaining matches will be at home. This encounter was initially due to be played on the weekend of April 12 and 13 before being postponed to give PSG a rest in between the two legs of their Champions League quarter-final against Aston Villa. They play Arsenal away in the first leg of their semi-final next Tuesday, but must first entertain Nice in another Ligue 1 game on Friday. Coach Luis Enrique is likely to once again heavily rotate his team for that match, having notably left out Achraf Hakimi altogether here and used the likes of Bradley Barcola and Doue from the bench.

RTHK,sport,Barca edge closer to Liga title with win over Mallorca,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801430-20250423.htm,"Barcelona inched closer to the La Liga title with a 1-0 win over Mallorca which took them seven points clear of Real Madrid. Spain international Dani Olmo slotted home to help Barca turn up the heat on second-placed champions Madrid, who visit Getafe on Wednesday. Hansi Flick's side, aiming for a potential quadruple, outplayed the visitors but could not extend their lead at the Olympic stadium as goalkeeper Leo Roman made save after save. With Saturday's Copa del Rey final against rivals Real Madrid in mind, Flick rested several of his usual starters. The coach handed former teenage prodigy Ansu Fati his first start since October and deployed Hector Fort on the left of the defence, with Ferran Torres up front in place of injured top scorer Robert Lewandowski. Barcelona created several chances in the first half and could hardly believe the score was goalless at the break. Gavi's deflected shot hit the post, while Torres fired over after Olmo played him in. ""We had a good game, the whole team, there were a lot of rotations today with players who hadn't played for a while and I'm really happy for them,"" Gavi said. ""Their goalkeeper had a great game, we had so many chances but that's football, they're not going to make it easy,"" he added. Fati also fired narrowly off target as the hosts turned the screw, and Roman saved from teenage star Lamine Yamal, before Fort's shot was blocked as Mallorca rode their luck. Now 22 and struggling for minutes at Barca, Fati drilled wide of the near post when he might have tested the increasingly-busy Roman, before Mateu Morey blasted home at the other end but was offside. Barcelona left the pitch frustrated but swiftly took the lead at the start of the second half, with Olmo firing home after a long string of passes. Fati came close to a second but Roman palmed his drive to safety. Flick sent on Raphinha and Fermín López to try and finish the job. Yamal should have added Barcelona's second when the excellent Pedri sent him through, but Roman made yet another save. The goalkeeper showed good reflexes to thwart Eric Garcia and then clawed out López's deflected shot when it looked like it was dipping over his head for his 10th save of the night. It was Roman's first appearance in the league in 2025 for Mallorca and although he and his side left without a point to show for it, another save to deny Lopez towards the end underlined his outstanding display. ""The coach has a huge problem deciding between Roman and usual goalkeeper Dominik Grief,"" said Mallorca defender José Copete. ""Leo's been training really well, he hadn't played for so long, and you just have to see how he played in a tricky game like today's."" Mallorca appealed for a penalty in stoppage time when Garcia held Abdon Prats in the box but their appeals were waved away.

RTHK,sport,Nunes strikes at the death as Man City sink Villa,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801423-20250423.htm,"Matheus Nunes scored a priceless stoppage-time winner as Manchester City beat top five-rivals Aston Villa 2-1 on Tuesday to boost their bid to qualify for the Champions League. Pep Guardiola's side were seconds away from a damaging draw at the Etihad Stadium after Bernardo Silva's early opener was cancelled out by Marcus Rashford's penalty. But Nunes's last-gasp strike sparked wild celebrations from Guardiola and his players as they climbed to third place in the Premier League. With the race for a top-five finish approaching a tense climax, Portugal midfielder Nunes, converted to right-back lately, could not have picked a better time to net his first league goal for City. City's 15th successive home league win against Villa wasn't quite as stunning as the fightback from two goals down that brought them the Premier League title on the last day of the 2021-22 season. But it could prove almost as lucrative, with a place in the Champions League now within their control. With four games left, City will remain at least fifth even if fourth-placed Nottingham Forest, fifth-placed Newcastle and sixth-placed Chelsea each win their game in hand. After winning the Premier League six times in the previous seven seasons, City have been reduced to fighting for a place in the Champions League at a time of year when they are usually in the title hunt. City's decline has already been remarkable enough, but enduring a first season without Champions League action since 2010-11 would be a new low and this was a vital step in avoiding that fate. City will turn their attention to the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest at Wembley on Sunday, while Villa must bounce back from a painful loss in time for their own last-four clash with Crystal Palace on Saturday. Villa were eliminated from the Champions League quarter-finals last week after narrowly failing in their bid for a dramatic fightback against Paris Saint-Germain in the second leg. This was another blow for Unai Emery's seventh-placed side, who are two points adrift of the top five with four games left. With Rashford on loan from Manchester United, it was no surprise that his name was loudly jeered by City fans before kick-off. The England forward almost silenced the boos just 19 seconds after kick-off when he slalomed past Ruben Dias for a low drive that smacked off the far post. After that narrow escape, Silva landed the first blow for City in the seventh minute. Omar Marmoush was the catalyst with an incisive surge into the Villa area before cutting his pass back to Silva, whose stinging strike from 10 yards was too powerful for Emiliano Martinez's awkward attempted save to keep out. Silva's first goal since December provoked an immediate response from Villa. In the 18th minute, Jacob Ramsey induced a lumbering challenge from Dias, who tripped the midfielder for a penalty that was only awarded by referee Craig Pawson after VAR told him to consult the pitchside monitor. Guardiola was furious with the decision, earning a booking for his tirade at the fourth official. Rashford kept his nerve, sending Stefan Ortega the wrong way from the spot for his fourth goal since his loan move in the January transfer window. Rashford's blistering speed was a constant danger to City and he easily out-paced their back four for a shot that Ortega blocked with his legs. However, City got to grips with Rashford better in the second half as they pushed for a winner. Nunes was their saviour in the fourth of five minutes of stoppage time when he met Jeremy Doku's low cross with a superb finish from the most acute of angles six yards from goal. Guardiola's frenzied fist-pumping dance of joy underlined the significance of a crucial result in a turbulent season that could still have an uplifting finale.

RTHK,international,Hamas team heads to Cairo for talks as strikes kill 26,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801403-20250422.htm,"A Hamas delegation left for Cairo to discuss ""new ideas"" aimed at securing a Gaza ceasefire, an official from the group said, as Israeli air strikes killed 26 people across the territory on Tuesday. The renewed effort follows Hamas's rejection last week of Israel's latest proposal to secure the release of hostages still held in Gaza. Talks have so far failed to produce any breakthrough since Israel resumed its air and ground assault on Gaza from March 18, ending a two-month ceasefire. ""The delegation will meet with Egyptian officials to discuss new ideas aimed at reaching a ceasefire,"" the Hamas official said, adding the team included the group's chief negotiator Khalil Al-Hayya. The discussions will come a day after newly appointed US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee urged Hamas to accept a deal that would secure the release of hostages in exchange for humanitarian aid entering Gaza. ""When that happens, and hostages are released which is an urgent matter for all of us, then we hope that the humanitarian aid will flow and flow freely knowing it will be done without Hamas being able to confiscate it and abuse their own people,"" Huckabee said in a video statement. Israel blocked all aid to Gaza on March 2, days before its renewed offensive began. Israel has accused the Palestinian militant group of diverting aid, which Hamas denies. ""Gaza has become a land of desperation,"" Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, said on X on Tuesday. ""Hunger is spreading and deepening, deliberate and manmade.... Humanitarian aid is being used as a bargaining chip and a weapon of war."" Qatar, with the United States and Egypt, brokered a truce in Gaza between Israel and Hamas which began on January 19 and enabled a surge in aid, alongside exchanges of hostages and prisoners. But the truce collapsed after disagreements over the terms of the next stage. Hamas had insisted that negotiations be held on a second phase of the truce, leading to a permanent end to the war, as outlined in the January framework announced by former US President Joe Biden. Israel, however, sought to extend the first phase. Following the impasse, Israel blocked aid and resumed its military campaign. Most recently, Israel proposed a 45-day ceasefire in exchange for the release of 10 living hostages – an offer Hamas rejected last week. Gaza's civil defence agency said Israeli air strikes killed at least 26 people across the Hamas-run territory on Tuesday. Among the fatalities were nine people when a house was struck in central Khan Younis, senior agency official Mohammad Mughayyir said, adding that six others remain trapped. ""We found people torn apart,"" said Ahmad Shourab who witnessed the strike. ""They were all women and children. What do they want from us?"" Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said air strikes also destroyed bulldozers and other equipment belonging to the Jabalia municipality in northern Gaza. ""We relied on them for rescue operations to clear debris and recover the bodies of martyrs from beneath the rubble,"" Bassal said. ""Now, if a large-scale strike occurs and heavy machinery is needed, how will we obtain the equipment to save lives, pull people from the rubble, or evacuate them from buildings targeted in attacks?"" Israel's military did not immediately comment on the latest strikes. At least 1,890 people have been killed in Gaza since the military resumed its offensive, bringing the total death toll since the war erupted to at least 51,266, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which ignited the war, resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures. Militants also abducted 251 people, 58 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.

RTHK,finance,IMF slashes global growth outlook due to US tariffs,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801398-20250422.htm,"The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday slashed its forecast for global growth this year, citing the effect of US President Donald Trump's new tariff policies on the world economy. The IMF's projections, which incorporate some but not all tariff measures introduced this year, see the global economy growing by 2.8 percent this year, 0.5 percentage points lower than the previous World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecast in January. Global growth is then forecast to hit 3.0 percent next year, down 0.3 percentage points from January. ""We are entering a new era as the global economic system that has operated for the last 80 years is being reset,"" IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told journalists ahead of the report's publication. ""The risks to the global economy have increased and are firmly to the downside,"" he added, noting that the recent US tariff announcements had more than halved the Fund's outlook for global trade growth this year. The WEO was published as global financial leaders gathered in Washington for the World Bank and IMF Spring Meetings, which are hosted by the two international financial institutions at their headquarters a stone's throw from the White House. Given the stop-start nature to Trump's tariff rollout, the IMF introduced a cut-off date of April 4, meaning they do not include the administration's latest salvos, which have hiked the level of new levies against China to 145 percent. If these policies were to be taken into account and sustained, this could significantly slow global growth, the IMF said. The IMF slashed its outlook for US growth to 1.8 percent this year – down 0.9 percentage points from January's forecast. Growth in the world's largest economy is then expected to cool further to 1.7 percent in 2026. This slowdown was due to ""greater policy uncertainty, trade tensions, and softer demand momentum,"" the IMF said in the WEO report. Gourinchas noted that the effects of tariffs would affect countries differently, acting as a supply shock in the United States that ""reduces productivity and output and increase prices."" The Fund hiked its inflation forecast for the United States this year to 3.0 percent, and to 2.5 percent next year. It expects tariffs will cause a broader increase in global prices, slightly raising its outlook for world consumer prices to 4.3 percent for 2025, and to 3.6 percent in 2026. Top US trading partners Mexico, Canada, and China are all predicted to be negatively impacted by the Trump administration's tariffs. The IMF expects China, the world's second-largest economy, to see growth slump to 4.0 percent this year, down from 5.0 percent in 2024. The Mexican economy is now projected to contract by 0.3 percent this year, a 1.7 percentage-point reduction from January, while Canada's growth outlook has also been sharply reduced. Japan, the world's third-largest economy, is expected to grow by just 0.6 percent this year and next, a sharp cut from January. The IMF expects the tariffs to act as a drag on growth in most European countries, with the growth outlook for the euro area cut to 0.8 percent in 2025, and 1.2 percent next year. Germany is now projected to see no growth this year, while the outlooks for France, Britain and Italy have also been pared back. The IMF sharply downgraded the outlook for the Middle East but still expects economic activity to pick up from 2024, as disruptions to oil production and shipping ease, ""and the impact of ongoing conflicts lessens."" In sub-Saharan Africa, growth is projected to decline slightly to 3.8 percent this year, before recovering next year. Faced with a gloomy forecast, Gourinchas urged countries to get around the negotiating table to hammer out a deal. ""Growth prospects could improve immediately if countries ease their current trade policy stance and implement clear and predictable trade rules,"" he said.

In a paper submitted to the Kwun Tong District Council, officials proposed building a hillside station between Ma Yau Tong and Yau Tong East, saying tens of thousands of nearby public housing residents will benefit. That's on top of eight stations initially planned: Choi Hung East, Choi Wan, Shun Lee, Shun On, Sau Mau Ping, Po Tat, Ma Yau Tong and Yau Tong East. Under the latest proposal, adjustments will be made to the section between Ma Yau Tong and Yau Tong East. That section will still be partly elevated and partly underground, but the tunnel portion will be reduced, to facilitate the construction of a terminus. Officials said they also adopted other changes to the smart and green transit project after considering suggestions by district councillors and members of the community. These include connecting the Choi Hung East and Yau Tong East stations to existing MTR stations with pedestrian bridges and tunnels, to facilitate transfer to Kwun Tong Line and Tseung Kwan O Line. The Shun On station will be built closer to United Christian Hospital, with a covered walkway added on Shun On Road for better access to the hospital. The government didn’t rule out the possibility of further extension of the transit system, saying space is reserved for potential northwest bound expansion to Tsz Wan Shan. There are also plans to re-purpose a depot site and adjacent land at the Ma Yau Tong station to allow for commercial and residential use. The government said the rezoned land of about 6.8 hectares could provide around 8,900 residential units, offering financial support for the project. The administration noted the goal is to complete the statutory procedures and tendering within next year and to award the contract by 2027.

The biggest crowds surrounded Xpeng's concept flying car, which sat alongside a six-wheeled van designed to carry it. Xpeng chief executive He Xiaopeng and president Brian Gu bristled with ambition, predicting the company would emerge as one of few survivors from China’s hypercompetitive EV industry by expanding globally and building in-house artificial-intelligence capabilities. Like Tesla, it aims to develop robotaxis and humanoid robots. Unlike Tesla, Xpeng has yet to turn a profit, despite fast-growing sales since its first car debuted in 2018 and an investment from Volkswagen. The same is true of scores of other China EV makers, even as the sector leads a technological revolution that is upending the automotive industry globally. Only a handful make money, most notably BYD, China's biggest EV-and-hybrid producer and Tesla's leading rival. The burning question facing China’s EV industry as it gathers in Shanghai is how and when it can convert explosive sales of ground-breaking vehicles into sustainable profits. The intense competition driving the sector's innovation has also made China a market with precious few winners, foreign or domestic. Gu takes a clear-eyed view of the challenge. ""In the past two decades, we can see that only a few companies are performing well,"" he said. ""I’m very concerned about Chinese automakers … I think in the end, only 10 will survive."" Xpeng is among the Chinese EV startups best positioned to thrive as the industry moves from the ""electrification"" era to ""smartification"" – competing on self-driving and other AI-driven technology, said Bo Yu, a China-market expert at research firm Jato Dynamics. ""They're not profitable because they've invested in a lot of new things, but their profitability is improving,"" she said of Xpeng. ""They've started in-house development of AI and self-driving, and the flying car isn't just a show – they really believe in it."" Jato Dynamics data show that 169 domestic and foreign auto brands are fighting it out in China, but only 14 have a market share higher than 2 percent. Last year, 86 brands produced a total of 327 EV models, not including hybrids. The competition has depressed prices to levels unfathomable outside China. As Tesla and other automakers struggle to produce EVs to sell for less than US$30,000 in the United States, BYD's entry-level Seagull electric hatchback – the star of the 2023 Shanghai auto show – is priced below US$10,000. Xpeng founder He said his company would have to balance chasing technological breakthroughs with cost control – and ""globalisation"" to seek profits outside China. Xpeng entered 30 new markets in 2024 and aims to enter another 30 countries this year. It aims to eventually sell half its vehicles outside China, where it will have more ""pricing power,"" the CEO said. Gu said Xpeng's ""core regions"" for expansion will be Europe, Southeast Asia, Middle East and Latin America. Conspicuously absent from that list is the United States, where President Donald Trump is escalating a long-running trade war with Beijing that has effectively banned Chinese cars and components. Such protectionism could backfire on US automakers, said Cameron Johnson, a Shanghai-based supply-chain consultant with Tidalwave Solutions. ""Chinese firms have the best automotive connected technology in the world, and foreign firms need it to be competitive around the world, especially as Chinese brands go global,"" he said. Gu said the industry revolution requires automakers to become tech companies themselves rather than relying on suppliers. Xpeng announced last week that it would soon equip its vehicles with its own AI chips. ""You have to possess capabilities in AI, in software, in technology and in manufacturing,” Gu said. “The players that can possess this full-stack capability will have a greater chance of survival.” Xpeng focuses on the higher-end segment and has seen accelerating sales, which last year totalled about 190,000 vehicles.

""The Airport Express has been facing sustained financial challenges since the Covid pandemic began in 2020, as it's been running a loss,"" it said. The rail firm also said fares for express lines to and from the airport in major cities like London, Tokyo, Seoul and Sydney have risen by 13 to 38 percent in the past eight years.

RTHK,greater_china,Electric buzz surrounds Shanghai Auto Show opening,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801329-20250422.htm,"The world's biggest auto show opens on Wednesday in Shanghai, with foreign carmakers raring to show they can compete against the ultra-competitive Chinese firms that dominate the sector's new electric frontier. As the petrol engine's primacy stutters, traditional industry expos like Paris and Detroit are scrambling to reinvent themselves – but in Shanghai the era of cleaner engines and AI-powered operating systems will be very much on display already. China is now leading the charge in the sector. In 2024 EVs and hybrids made up 26 and 19 percent respectively of total car sales in the country, according to Inovev. ""It's the only country that manages to get the automobile sector's industrial giants cohabiting with the innovation of a multitude of startups – operational excellence and [production] volume with innovation and daring,"" Deloitte analyst Guillaume Crunelle told AFP. Auto Shanghai, which runs until May 2, will see a flurry of launches for electric, high-tech new models – luxury SUVs, saloons and multi-purpose vehicles – all designed and built in record time. Dozens of brands will take part, from state-owned behemoths to start-ups such as Li Auto and Xpeng, tech giants with skin in the game like Huawei, and consumer electronics-turned-car company Xiaomi. Analysts consider the Chinese market, the world's largest, younger-leaning and more open to novelty. Many of its companies are also looking to expand overseas, in the hope increased sales in markets including Southeast Asia, Europe and Latin America will safeguard their future. Foreign carmakers have also found themselves caught out by the new market conditions, none more so than the Germans. After years of market domination in China, Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes have seen sales fall as domestic brands' stars have risen. Volkswagen is hoping to bounce back at this year's show with three vehicles developed in and for China, a first for the German group, as well as an advanced autonomous driving system. The group aims to revitalise itself through cost-cutting, helped by a partnership with China's Xpeng. German carmakers cannot give up entirely on China, though, especially with looming uncertainty caused by Donald Trump's threatened tariff rises on European countries. One of the biggest US companies active in China, Tesla, will not be attending Auto Shanghai, despite its two massive factories in the city. Elon Musk's EV giant has not exhibited at a major car show in China since 2021, when a one-woman protest over an alleged brake failure went viral on social media.

RTHK,international,Gang violence in Haiti approaching 'total chaos': UN,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801287-20250422.htm,"Haiti, where rampant gang violence has surged in recent weeks, is approaching a ""point of no return"" leading to ""total chaos,"" the UN special representative to the troubled Caribbean nation warned on Monday. ""As gang violence continues to spread to new areas of the country, Haitians experience growing levels of vulnerability and increasing skepticism about the ability of the state to respond to their needs,"" Maria Isabel Salvador told the UN Security Council. ""Haiti could face total chaos,"" she said, adding that international aid was desperately needed to avoid that fate. ""I urge you to remain engaged and answer the urgent needs of the country and its people."" Salvador cited cholera outbreaks and gender-based violence alongside a deteriorating security situation, particularly in the capital Port-au-Prince, with authorities struggling to cope. The poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti faces severe political instability, while swathes of the country are under the control of rival armed gangs who carry out widespread murders, rapes and kidnappings. The armed groups have been battling for control of Port-au-Prince and clashes have intensified as the rival gangs attempt to establish new territories. A Kenyan-led force authorised by the United Nations has failed to push back the gangs. The mission has around 1,000 police officers from six countries but was intended to have 2,500. In a report, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that further international support was ""required immediately to allow the national police to prevent the capital slipping closer to the brink."" Haiti's ambassador to the UN, Ericq Pierre, said his country was ""slowly dying"" under the combined action of armed gangs, drug traffickers and arms dealers, calling on his partners to ""help rid the country of the gangs that are terrorising the population."" The report detailed the upsurge in violence, with the UN recording 2,660 homicides in the three months from December 2024 - a 41.3 percent increase over the previous quarter. Anti-gang operations resulted in 702 people killed in that time, of which 21 percent were estimated to be innocent civilians, the report said. Gender-based violence also recorded an alarming increase, with 347 incidents reported in the five months to February 2025, according to UN data. Collective rape was the most common violation, accounting for 61 percent of cases.

Cade Cunningham scored 33 points and grabbed 12 rebounds and Dennis Schroder added 20 points off the bench – including a go-ahead three-pointer with 55.7 seconds left as the Pistons thwarted the Knicks' rally bid. The Pistons, in the playoffs for the first time since 2019, notched their first playoff victory since game four of the 2008 Eastern Conference finals against the Boston Celtics. Two days after the Knicks authored a 21-0 scoring run to rally in game one, the Pistons were pushed to the finish in a fast-paced, physical encounter at Madison Square Garden. They led by as many as 15 in the third quarter, but the Knicks had cut the deficit to eight going into to the final period. New York star Jalen Brunson scored 14 of his 37 points in the fourth and fed Josh Hart for a dunk that tied it at 94-94 with 1:15 to play. But Schroder answered immediately, drilling a three-pointer that put the Pistons ahead for good. The Knicks came up empty three straight possessions while Schroder and Jalen Duren connected at the free-throw line to seal Detroit's win. Tobias Harris scored 15 points and pulled down 13 rebounds and Duren had 12 points and 13 boards. Mikal Bridges scored 19 for the Knicks as Karl-Anthony Towns and OG Anunoby were held to 10 apiece.

The Shenzhou-20 mission will blast off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China, carrying three astronauts to the country's self-built Tiangong space station. The space agency said last week that the Shenzhou spaceship and its Long March-2F carrier rocket were transferred to a launch site at the remote desert base and would launch ""at an appropriate time in the near future"". Photographs published by Xinhua News Agency showed the sleek white rocket perched on a blue pedestal. ""At present, the launch site facilities and equipment are in good condition. The functional inspections and joint tests will be carried out as planned,"" the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) said. Zhou Wenxing, a staff member at the country's astronaut training centre, said the crew was ""in good condition, precise in operation, and smooth in coordination"", CCTV reported. The previous crewed mission, Shenzhou-19, launched last October and will reach its planned end date on April 29. It is headed by Cai Xuzhe, a 48-year-old former air force pilot who served a previous stint aboard the Tiangong space station as part of the Shenzhou-14 mission in 2022. Also among the crew is Wang Haoze, 35, who is China's only female spaceflight engineer and the third Chinese woman to take part in a crewed mission. Song Lingdong, 34, completes the trio. The Shenzhou-19 team has been carrying out tests to see how extreme radiation, gravity, temperature and other conditions affect ""bricks"" made from components imitating lunar soil, according to reports at the time of the launch. China's space programme was the third to put humans in orbit and has also landed robotic rovers on Mars and the moon. The Tiangong space station is staffed by teams of three astronauts that are rotated every six months. Beijing says it is on track to send a crewed mission to the moon by 2030. In 2019, it landed its Chang'e-4 probe on the far side of the moon - the first spacecraft ever to do so. In 2021, it landed a small robot on Mars.

The outcome of the case could fundamentally reshape the internet by unseating Google as the go-to portal for information online. The Justice Department is seeking an order that would require Google to sell its Chrome browser and take other measures to end what a judge found was its monopoly in online search. Prosecutors have compared the lawsuit to past cases that resulted in the break up of AT&T and Standard Oil. Now is the ""time to tell Google and all other monopolists who are out there listening, and they are listening, that there are consequences when you break the antitrust laws,"" DOJ attorney David Dahlquist said during his opening statement. The DOJ and a broad coalition of state attorneys general are pressing for remedies they believe will restore competition even as search evolves to overlap with generative AI products such as ChatGPT. ""This court's remedy should be forward-looking and not ignore what is on the horizon,"" Dahlquist said. Google's search monopoly helps improve its AI products, which are also a way to lead users to its search engine, he said. Google has agreed to pay Samsung monthly to install Google's Gemini AI app on devices such as smartphones, a deal that can be extended into 2028, according to documents shown at trial.

The beginning of voting coincides with a slump in popularity of the opposition Liberal Party leader Peter Dutton, who has struggled to shake off perceived ideological closeness to US President Donald Trump. Dutton was forced to abandon a policy that would have required federal government workers to return to the office full time while cutting tens of thousands of public sector jobs, seen as taking inspiration from Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), set up by Elon Musk. Albanese has surged in the polls from a deficit of six points against Dutton's conservative coalition as recently as January to a lead of as much as nine points earlier this month. Polling from Newspoll released on Sunday showed Labor held a four-point lead over the opposition when votes from smaller parties are redistributed as part of the country's preferential voting system where voters rank their choices. ""There's no complacency from my camp, I assure you of that,"" Albanese told a press conference on Monday. ""This election is certainly up for grabs."" He pointed to the 2019 federal election, when some betting firms paid out early on a Labor victory, in an election that was ultimately won by Liberal leader Scott Morrison. Campaigning in the election, where voting is compulsory for Australians over 18, is expected to be subdued on Tuesday following the death of Pope Francis. Dutton and Albanese are due to meet in a third and final televised election debate on Tuesday evening.

RTHK,international,Harvard sues the Trump administration,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801276-20250422.htm,"Harvard sued US President Donald Trump's administration on Monday in a sharp escalation of the fight between the prestigious university and the Republican, who has threatened its funding and sought to impose outside political supervision. Trump has sought to bring several prestigious universities to heel over claims they tolerated campus anti-Semitism, threatening their budgets, tax-exempt status and the enrolment of foreign students, but Harvard has refused to bow. ""This case involves the Government's efforts to use the withholding of federal funding as leverage to gain control of academic decision making at Harvard,"" the Ivy League university said in a lawsuit filed in a Massachusetts federal court that named several other institutions targeted by Trump. ""The Government's actions flout not just the First Amendment, but also federal laws and regulations,"" said the complaint, which called Trump's actions ""arbitrary and capricious."" Trump is furious at Harvard for rejecting government supervision of its admissions, hiring practices and political slant and last week ordered the freezing of US$2.2 billion in federal funding to the storied institution. The lawsuit calls for the freezing of funds and conditions imposed on federal grants to be declared unlawful, as well as for the Trump administration to pay Harvard's costs. Trump and his White House team have publicly justified their campaign against universities as a reaction to what they say is uncontrolled ""anti-Semitism"" and a need to reverse diversity programmes aimed at addressing historical oppression of minorities. The administration claims protests against Israel's war in Gaza that swept across US college campuses last year were rife with anti-Semitism. Many US universities, including Harvard, cracked down on the protests over the allegations at the time, with the Cambridge-based institution placing 23 students on probation and denying degrees to 12 others, according to protest organisers. ""Harvard can no longer be considered even a decent place of learning, and should not be considered on any list of the World's Great Universities or Colleges,"" Trump said on his Truth Social platform last week. ""Harvard is a JOKE, teaches Hate and Stupidity, and should no longer receive Federal Funds."" Harvard President Alan Garber said that Trump's administration had launched ""numerous investigations"" into the university's operations. Last week, Garber flatly refused to ""negotiate over (Harvard's) independence or its constitutional rights."" Other top institutions, including Columbia University, have bowed to less sweeping demands from the Trump administration, which claims that the educational elite is too left-wing. The Department of Homeland Security has also threatened Harvard's ability to enrol international students unless it turns over records on visa-holders' ""illegal and violent activities."" International students made up 27.2 percent of Harvard's enrolment this academic year, according to its website. ""Make no mistake: Harvard rejects anti-Semitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate anti-Semitism on campus,"" said Monday's lawsuit. ""But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with anti-Semitism."" Trump's claims about diversity tap into long-standing conservative complaints that US university campuses are too liberal, shutting out right-wing voices and favouring minorities.

RTHK,finance,US regulators accuse Uber of misleading users,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801273-20250422.htm,"US regulators filed a lawsuit on Monday accusing Uber of misleading users about promotional savings at Uber One subscription service and even signing them up without consent.

""Americans are tired of getting signed up for unwanted subscriptions that seem impossible to cancel,"" FTC chair Andrew Ferguson said in a release announcing the suit. ""We're alleging that Uber not only deceived consumers about their subscriptions, but also made it unreasonably difficult for customers to cancel.""

Uber denied signing people up without consent and said most cancellations of subscriptions take less than 20 seconds in the app. ""We are disappointed that the FTC chose to move forward with this action,"" an Uber spokesperson told AFP.

RTHK,sport,Forest see off Spurs to boost Champions League hopes,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801268-20250422.htm,"Nottingham Forest beat struggling Tottenham 2-1, bouncing back from two defeats to strengthen their push for a Champions League spot and heaping the pressure on Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou. Forest came into the game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in sixth spot in the table after losses to Aston Villa and Everton. But early goals from Elliot Anderson and top-scorer Chris Wood settled their nerves and they held on tenaciously despite a late goal from Richarlison to climb to third in the table. Leaders Liverpool have one hand on the Premier League title and Arsenal are likely to finish second. But behind them the competition is fierce for the top five places that will guarantee qualification for the Champions League next season. Just three points separate Forest from Aston Villa in seventh spot, with five games remaining for all the contenders. Nuno Espirito Santo's visitors took the lead in the fifth minute following a corner when Anderson's deflected shot beat Guglielmo Vicario. Wood had the ball in the net five minutes later but it was ruled out by VAR for offside. But the New Zealander doubled Forest's lead in the 16th minute, nodding a cross from Anthony Elanga past Vicario. Spurs dominated possession and had more shots on goal but provided little threat. Forest had a chance to make it 3-0 10 minutes into the second half when Wood cushioned the ball into the path of Morgan Gibbs-White but the midfielder skewed his shot wide. Forest defender Harry Toffolo produced a spectacular overhead goalline clearance to keep out Dejan Kulusevski's header shortly after the hour mark. Substitute Spurs defender Kevin Danso let fly from range but it did not trouble Matz Sels. Postecoglou brought on former Forest winger Brennan Johnson and forward Dominic Solanke with a quarter of the match to go. Sels produced a superb fingertip save low down to his right from a Richarlison header with about 10 minutes to go as Tottenham upped the pressure. The Brazilian did get on the scoresheet in the 87th minute, powering a header home from a Pedro Porro cross but the visitors held on. Forest are two-time European champions but have not played in the continent's top club competition since the 1980/81 season. Spurs' 18th defeat of a miserable Premier League season leaves them just two places above the relegation zone. But Postecoglou still has a chance to win silverware in his second season at the club. Spurs face Bodo/Glimt in the semi-finals of the Europa League next month, with the winner of the competition guaranteed a place in next season's Champions League.

RTHK,international,US envoy urges Hamas to sign deal so aid can get in,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801253-20250422.htm,"The new US ambassador to Israel on Monday called on Palestinian militant group Hamas to accept a deal that would secure the release of hostages, in exchange for the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. ""We call upon Hamas to sign an agreement so that humanitarian aid can flow into Gaza to the people who desperately need it,"" Mike Huckabee said in a video statement on X. ""When that happens, and hostages are released, which is an urgent matter for all of us, then we hope that the humanitarian aid will flow and flow freely, knowing it will be done without Hamas being able to confiscate it and abuse their own people,"" he added. Huckabee's message comes after Hamas on Thursday signalled its rejection of Israel's latest truce proposal, which a Hamas source said proposed a hostage-prisoner swap and the entry of aid. The militants' chief negotiator said the group rejected any ""partial"" agreements and sought a comprehensive deal including ""halting the war"" and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The war began in October 2023 when Hamas attacked Israel. Qatar, with the United States and Egypt, brokered a truce in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, which began on January 15 and enabled a surge in aid, alongside the exchange of hostages and prisoners. The initial phase of the truce ended in early March, with the two sides unable to agree on the next steps. Hamas had insisted that negotiations be held for a second phase of the truce, leading to a permanent end to the war, as outlined in the January framework. Israel sought an extension of the first phase. It blocked all aid to Gaza on March 2 and then resumed its air and ground offensive against Hamas on March 18. Israel has accused the Palestinian militant group of diverting aid, which Hamas denies. Last week the United Nations said Gaza was facing its most severe humanitarian crisis since the war began. The heads of 12 major aid organisations warned on Thursday that ""famine is not just a risk, but is likely rapidly unfolding in almost all parts"" of the territory.

RTHK,sport,"Korir wins Boston Marathon, Lokedi upstages Obiri",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801250-20250422.htm,"Kenya's John Korir stormed to victory in the Boston Marathon on Monday, while compatriot Sharon Lokedi trumped defending champion Hellen Obiri in the women's race. Korir, whose victory in the 2024 Chicago Marathon in a time of 2:02:44 made him the sixth fastest marathoner in history, clocked 2hr 04min 45sec for the win. The 28-year-old's feat emulated that of his brother Wesley Korir, the now-Kenyan politician, having won in Boston in 2012 on his first attempt in five appearances. Tanzania's 2017 world bronze medallist Alphonce Felix Simbu was second, just holding off Kenya's Cybrian Kotut in a photo-finish in 2:05.04. The first American home was Conner Mantz in fourth, missing out on a podium place by just four seconds, a time that was also just eight seconds off Ryan Hall's fastest US marathon time ever. Lokedi timed 2:17:22 in the women's race, outpacing Obiri by 19 seconds, with Yalemserf Yehualaw rounding out the podium. She smashed the previous course record of 2:19:59 set by Ethiopia's Buzunesh Deba in 2014. The men's field included 21 sub-2:09 runners, but none could get close to Kenyan Geoffrey Mutai's course record of 2:03.02 set back in 2011. US Olympian Mantz took the lead group of 21 runners through the 5km mark in 14:20 in a marathon which first saw men compete back in 1897. By the 10km mark, hit in 28:52, defending champion Sisay Lemma had taken up the front running, and the pack fell to 16 5km later. Rory Linkletter led Lemma through halfway in 1:01.52, but the pace proved too much for the Ethiopian, who promptly dropped out just after 1:19 on the road. Coming to the business end of the race, Korir, Mukhtar Edris, Daniel Mateiko and two-time winner Evans Chebet were all in the running in a lead field 13 deep, Mantz doing the majority of the pace setting. Korir made his move around the 34km mark, surging to take a lead he would never cede. He quickly built it up to nearly a minute as the others scrambled not only to reel him in but also fight for podium spots. Korir held his nerve as Kotut and Simbu surged through themselves to stage their own mini-battle for second place, Mantz doing well for fourth as Edris faded into fifth spot. Obiri had been looking to become the first woman since 1999 to win three consecutive Boston Marathon titles, something only four women have ever done. Only Deba had broken 2:20 pace in Boston, but a group of 14 remained on track for that mark at the halfway point. The pack split, but Obiri had not counted on Lokedi's electric finish, the 31-year-old pulling clear at the death for a new Boston record, with 32,000 participants on the heels of the elite runners.

The first American home was Conner Mantz in fourth, missing out on a podium place by just four seconds, a time that was also just eight seconds off Ryan Hall's fastest US marathon time ever. Lokedi timed 2:17:22 in the women's race, outpacing Obiri by 19 seconds, with Yalemserf Yehualaw rounding out the podium. She smashed the previous course record of 2:19:59 set by Ethiopia's Buzunesh Deba in 2014. The men's field included 21 sub-2:09 runners, but none could get close to Kenyan Geoffrey Mutai's course record of 2:03.02 set back in 2011. US Olympian Mantz took the lead group of 21 runners through the 5km mark in 14:20 in a marathon which first saw men compete back in 1897. By the 10km mark, hit in 28:52, defending champion Sisay Lemma had taken up the front running, and the pack fell to 16 5km later. Rory Linkletter led Lemma through halfway in 1:01.52, but the pace proved too much for the Ethiopian, who promptly dropped out just after 1:19 on the road. Coming to the business end of the race, Korir, Mukhtar Edris, Daniel Mateiko and two-time winner Evans Chebet were all in the running in a lead field 13 deep, Mantz doing the majority of the pace setting. Korir made his move around the 34km mark, surging to take a lead he would never cede. He quickly built it up to nearly a minute as the others scrambled not only to reel him in but also fight for podium spots. Korir held his nerve as Kotut and Simbu surged through themselves to stage their own mini-battle for second place, Mantz doing well for fourth as Edris faded into fifth spot. Obiri had been looking to become the first woman since 1999 to win three consecutive Boston Marathon titles, something only four women have ever done. Only Deba had broken 2:20 pace in Boston, but a group of 14 remained on track for that mark at the halfway point. The pack split, but Obiri had not counted on Lokedi's electric finish, the 31-year-old pulling clear at the death for a new Boston record, with 32,000 participants on the heels of the elite runners.

RTHK,sport,Leeds on brink of Premier League promotion,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801248-20250422.htm,"Leeds are on the brink of promotion to the Premier League after Joel Piroe scored four goals in a 6-0 demolition of Stoke on Monday. Daniel Farke's men will return to the top division if Sheffield United fail to win at second-placed Burnley in the evening kick-off. Burnley will be promoted along with Leeds if they beat Sheffield United. Leeds, who last played in the Premier League in the 2022/23 season, suffered the agony of defeat to Southampton in last season's Championship play-off final at Wembley. The Yorkshire club – three-time English champions – are now near certainties to gain promotion after humbling Stoke at Elland Road. Dutch forward Piroe, who had not scored since late February, returned to form with a vengeance, celebrating a hat-trick in the 20th minute. Junior Firpo made it four, and Piroe, the club's leading scorer this season, netted his fourth goal shortly before half-time. The game was already long over as a contest but Wilfried Gnonto nodded a sixth goal in the 59th minute. Leeds wobbled from the start of March, winning just one in six games, raising fears that they would again have to settle for a place in the play-offs. But they have now won their past four league games and may have just hours to wait until their promotion is confirmed.

For Zhao, who will face compatriot and fellow giant killer Lei Peifan next, it is a road to redemption after the 28-year-old served a 20-month ban for breaching betting regulations. As a result he is playing as an amateur in Sheffield, although he will return to the professional circuit next season. Lei beat 2024 champion Kyren Wilson on Saturday but Jones believes Zhao can go all the way and secure a historic success as he bids to become the first amateur and Chinese world champion. ""I don't see anyone who is playing better than him,"" said Jones. ""If he wins it, I wouldn't be surprised at all and that would be good for the game."" ""There are players who have won a lot more, but I don't see anyone in the tournament who is actually better than him,"" added the 31-year-old Welshman. Although Jones won the first two frames of the session – including a century break – to close the gap to 7-4, Zhao rallied and rattled off the next three frames to seal his place in the next round. Zhao's victory means there will be at least four Chinese players in the last 16 – a record. Zhao said having to battle through four qualifying rounds to earn the right to play in the main event had shaken off some of the rustiness he felt through a lack of big tournament play. ""Overall I'm pleased with my performance, especially in terms of scoring,"" said Zhao. ""This match was about regaining confidence.

The Latvian cruised to victory, converting her first match point to lift her first WTA singles trophy since February last year. ""It's great to share the court with you – you're a champion,"" Ostapenko said to Sabalenka in her on-court interview. Three-time Grand Slam champion Sabalenka has now lost four finals in Stuttgart in the past five seasons. ""I'm sure you hate me now because you wanted this car so badly, but I'm sure you'll get it another time,"" Ostapenko added of the car that tournament winners receive as a bonus prize. The 26-year-old Sabalenka, who won the 2024 US and Australian Opens, is still waiting for her first tournament victory on clay since the 2023 Madrid Open. ""You were a better player than me, that's all there is to it,"" Sabalenka said. Ostapenko broke her opponent in the very first game of the match to set the tone. She did the same in the opening game of the second set, which appeared to break Sabalenka's resistance, with the Belarusian growing increasingly frustrated. At one point, Sabalenka fell to the clay, but signalled to her opponent and the umpire that she was not injured. The tournament win completes an impressive week for Ostapenko in Germany. She defeated five-time Grand Slam winner Iga Swiatek, ranked second, in the quarters before a straight-sets victory over Ekaterina Alexandrova in the semi-finals.

The Celtics, fuelled by 30 points from Derrick White, defeated Orlando Magic 103-86. The Cavaliers, who beat out the Celtics for top seed in the Eastern Conference, downed Miami Heat 121-100 and the Warriors, with 31 points from Stephen Curry, fended off a late Houston surge to beat the Rockets 95-85. Oklahoma City, who emerged as top seeds in the Western Conference with the best overall record in the league, seized a 1-0 lead in their best-of-seven first-round series in emphatic style. The Thunder's 51-point margin of victory was even more remarkable given that Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had his statistically worst performance of the season – managing just 15 points, five assists and three rebounds. But all of Oklahoma City's starters scored in double figures with Jalen Williams providing 20 points along with six assists and Aaron Wiggins contributing 21 points off the bench. The win was the fifth-largest ever in NBA playoff history and also a franchise record. ""We played to our identity,"" Gilgeous-Alexander said. ""It's going to be the key to our success – just be true to who we are."" Grizzlies star Ja Morant finished with 17 points and vowed Memphis – who battled through the play-in tournament – would bounce back. ""We'll never play that bad again,"" Morant said. Things were more tense in the day's other Western Conference battle in Houston, where the Rockets sliced a 23-point deficit to three midway through the fourth quarter before the Warriors pulled away again to win. Curry shook off a slow start to connect on 12 of 19 shots from the floor, including five three-pointers. Jimmy Butler added 25 points, seven rebounds, six assists and five steals for the Warriors. ""Stayed in it,"" Butler said. ""Gave up a little run, but in the end we won."" In Boston, star forward Jayson Tatum scored a modest 17 points and finished the game despite a frightening fall under the basket in the fourth quarter that left him nursing a sore right wrist. Tatum rose for a dunk and crashed to the court after he was hit by Kentavious Caldwell-Pope – who was assessed a flagrant foul upon review. The Celtics faithful at TD Garden were delighted to see Tatum make his first three-pointer of the night soon after, and Tatum said after the game his wrist was fine. Jaylen Brown, back for the postseason after battling knee trouble, scored 16 points and Payton Pritchard added 19 off the bench for Boston, who trailed by one after a nip-and-tuck first half but pulled away relentlessly after the break. ""Just a good response there in the second half,"" said White, who had seven of the Celtics' 16 three-pointers. Paolo Banchero scored 36 points and grabbed 11 rebounds for the Magic. Franz Wagner added 23 points but no other Orlando player scored in double figures. In Cleveland, Donovan Mitchell scored 30 points and Ty Jerome added 16 of his 28 in the fourth quarter as the Cavaliers finally put away the determined Heat. Miami, who advanced from the play-in tournament on Friday, trailed by 16 in the second quarter, but kept chipping away and were down by just eight midway through the fourth quarter. Jerome, in his first playoff game, caught fire, making six of his seven shots in the final period to help Cleveland pull away for good.

Trump slapped 25 percent tariffs on South Korea this month, which were later suspended for three months. (Reuters)",2025-04-21 10:40:16

RTHK,sport,Leicester relegated as Liverpool close in on title,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1801150-20250421.htm,"Trent Alexander-Arnold fired Liverpool to the brink of the Premier League title as his late strike sealed a 1-0 win that relegated Leicester after Arsenal's 4-0 rout of Ipswich delayed the leaders' coronation on Sunday. Arne Slot's side could have clinched a record-equalling 20th English title with a combination of an Arsenal loss and a victory at the King Power Stadium. Liverpool fulfilled their half of the equation, but second-placed Arsenal were not so obliging earlier in the afternoon. The Gunners' stroll at Portman Road meant Liverpool kicked off still needing six points from their last six games to seal a first title since 2020. Thanks to Alexander-Arnold's match-winning contribution after coming off the bench, Liverpool are 13 points clear of Arsenal with five games left for both teams. The Reds will seal the title if Arsenal lose at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday or if they beat Tottenham at Anfield on April 27. It looked like being a frustrating day for Liverpool as second-bottom Leicester kept them at bay despite a host of chances for the visitors. Slot's men finally made the breakthrough in the 76th minute when Alexander-Arnold lashed home the rebound from close-range after Mohamed Salah and Diogo Jota both hit the crossbar. With speculation mounting that Alexander-Arnold will join Real Madrid when his contract expires at the end of the season, it was notable that the England right-back embarked on a wild celebration of his winner. Alexander-Arnold earned a booking for ripping off his shirt and planting it on the corner flag after he sprinted to 3,000 jubilant Liverpool fans in one corner of the King Power. ""It took us a long time and, of course, a great moment for Trent after working so hard to come back. To score the goal that makes a lot of difference is very special,"" Slot said. ""It's never hard to dream (of the title) but you see we are really focused on playing Tottenham."" Liverpool's title celebration is only a matter of time but Leicester will spend next season in the Championship after their woeful one-year stay in the top tier came to an end with a 23rd defeat in 33 league games. Fresh from a famous victory over Real Madrid on Wednesday to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time since 2009, Arsenal ensured Liverpool would not be able to start their party this weekend. Mikel Arteta made only three changes from the 2-1 win in the Spanish capital and was rewarded with a dominant display to kill the game off inside half an hour. ""All we can do is delay that moment (Liverpool win the league) from our side to earn the right to finish as high as possible,"" Arteta said. Leandro Trossard was one of those recalled by Arteta and prodded in his eighth goal of the season to open the scoring. A flowing move saw Bukayo Saka's cross flicked by Mikel Merino into the path of Gabriel Martinelli to finish to double the Gunners lead. Moments later, Saka was chopped down by an awful challenge from Leif Davis that saw the Ipswich left-back shown a straight red card. Trossard fired in his second after a well-worked corner before Ethan Nwaneri's deflected effort rounded off the scoring. Defeat realistically ends third-bottom Ipswich's hope of maintaining their Premier League status as they are 15 points adrift of safety with five games remaining and have a significantly poorer goal difference than West Ham. Chelsea needed two late goals at Fulham to revive their chances of Champions League football next season with a dramatic 2-1 victory. Alex Iwobi opened the scoring on 20 minutes and Chelsea were meandering towards a damaging defeat until 19-year-old substitute Tyrique George fired in a snap shot from the edge of the box on 83 minutes. Pedro Neto then completed the comeback with a stunning strike in stoppage-time to secure Chelsea's sixth win in their last 17 league games. Fifth-placed Chelsea moved above Nottingham Forest, who travel to Tottenham on Monday. Manchester United succumbed to an eighth home league defeat of the season as Wolves won 1-0 at Old Trafford. Pablo Sarabia curled in a brilliant free-kick 13 minutes from time to hand United a club record 15th league loss this term. Wolves' fifth consecutive Premier League win lifts Vitor Pereira's side up to 15th and level on points with United, who stay 14th on goal difference.

The commitment was underscored in a joint statement issued when President Xi Jinping wrapped up his state visit to Cambodia, where the two countries highlighted their mutual goal of building an all-weather China-Cambodia community with a shared future in the new era and implementing three China-proposed global initiatives. The statement emphasized their dedication to maintaining a trading system that is predictable, rules-based, transparent, non-discriminatory, open and inclusive. The two sides are of one mind that trade and investment restrictions pose a threat to economic security and the international trade order. They recognise the WTO's importance as a platform for trade rule-making, review, and dialogue and cooperation, and acknowledge its crucial role in promoting trade and investment liberalization and facilitation.

RTHK,international,Singapore PM calls May 3 election in tariffs test,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800466-20250415.htm,"Singaporeans vote on May 3 in an election that will test Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's leadership, as the wealthy city-state faces a turbulent global economy upended by US tariffs. This will be the first electoral battle for the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) under Wong since he succeeded Lee Hsien Loong, the son of founding premier Lee Kuan Yew, last year after decades of leadership by the Lees. Parliament was dissolved on Tuesday, clearing the way for the vote. Singapore has long been dominated by the PAP, which is expected to remain in power, but opposition gains are closely watched as a referendum on the government's popularity. And the upcoming elections come at a precarious time. The global trading system that supported tiny, trade-reliant Singapore's rapid ascent to prosperity is under severe strain since US President Donald Trump's return to the White House. Singapore, one of the world's biggest transhipment hubs, finds itself exposed after Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, disrupting global supply chains and sparking fears of a full-blown trade war with China. On Monday, Singapore's trade ministry downgraded its economic growth forecast for 2025 to between zero and 2 percent from 1 to 3 percent. In a stark warning to parliament last week, Premier Wong declared that the ""era of rules-based globalisation and free trade is over"". ""We risk being squeezed out, marginalised and left behind,"" he said. Wong, 52, is seeking a firm mandate to steer the country through choppy waters. It will ""strengthen his hand and that of his government in putting in place policies and measures to protect the economy and to negotiate with other countries"", said Eugene Tan, associate professor of law at the Singapore Management University. PAP is one of the world's longest-running political parties having been in power since 1959. But the party's dominance is increasingly being challenged by a more vocal electorate, especially among younger voters who appear open to alternative political voices. The upcoming elections ""may well be the toughest electoral battle for the ruling party"", said Mustafa Izzuddin, a political analyst with Solaris Strategies Singapore, citing the ""unpredictability of ground sentiments and the emergence of a better quality opposition"". Tan of SMU said ""millennial and Gen-Z voters are much more receptive... to a credible opposition in parliament"". In 2020, the opposition Workers' Party (WP) made historic gains, winning 10 of the 93 seats at stake – a significant jump from its previously held four seats. It is hoping to build on that momentum and is expected to field candidates like Harvard-trained senior counsel Harpreet Singh, 59.

This will be the first electoral battle for the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) under Wong since he succeeded Lee Hsien Loong, the son of founding premier Lee Kuan Yew, last year after decades of leadership by the Lees. Parliament was dissolved on Tuesday, clearing the way for the vote.

Around 880 tonnes of hazardous material are inside the site after a catastrophic tsunami caused by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake triggered one of history's worst nuclear accidents in 2011. Removing the debris is seen as the most daunting challenge in a decades-long decommissioning project because of the dangerously high radiation levels. ""At 10.03am [9.03am Hong Kong time], the second trial extraction operation was started,"" Fukushima operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) said. The second removal comes after Tepco completed the first trial removal operation using a specially developed extendible device in November. The sample weighing just below 0.7 grams – equivalent to about one raisin – was delivered to a research lab near Tokyo for analysis. But Tepco needs more data to examine methods for full-scale debris extractions. The company said in December it was ""upgrading"" the telescopic device used for the first experiment by attaching a new camera to its tip. Three of Fukushima's six reactors went into meltdown in 2011 after the huge tsunami swamped the facility. Last month, robots began moving sandbags that were used to absorb radiation-contaminated water on underground floors of two buildings at the Fukushima site. In 2023, Japan began releasing into the Pacific Ocean some of the 540 Olympic swimming pools' worth of treated wastewater in a move that has been endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency. China banned Japanese seafood imports as a result, and Russia later followed suit. This month China said it found no abnormalities in seawater and marine life samples that it independently collected near Fukushima in February. But Beijing indicated that more tests would be needed before it lifts the ban.

RTHK,international,US launches probes in prelude to new tariffs,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800453-20250415.htm,"The Trump administration has taken its next steps towards imposing more tariffs on key imports, launching investigations into imports of computer chips, chip-making equipment and pharmaceuticals. The US Department of Commerce posted notices about the probes late on Monday on the Federal Register, seeking public comment within three weeks. It had not formally announced them earlier. Although US President Donald Trump paused most of his biggest tariff hikes last week for 90 days, apart from those for imports from China, he has said he still plans tariffs on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips. The Commerce Department said it is investigating how imports of computer chips, equipment to make them and products that contain them – which include many daily necessities such as cars, refrigerators, smart phones and other items – affect national security. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 permits the president to order tariffs to for the sake of national security. The probe includes assessing the potential for US domestic production of computer chips to meet US demand and the role of foreign manufacturing and assembly, testing and packaging in meeting those needs. Among other aspects of the entire computer chip supply chain, the government intends to also study the risks of having computer chip production concentrated in other places and the impact on US competitiveness from foreign government subsidies, “foreign unfair trade practices and state-sponsored overcapacity”. After Trump said electronics would not be included in what his administration calls “reciprocal tariffs"" of up to 50 percent on some nations, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick explained in an interview on ABC News that pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and autos will be handled with “sector specific” tariffs. “And those are not available for negotiation,” Lutnick said. “They are just going to be part of making sure we reshore the core national security items that need to be made in this country. ""We need to make medicine in this country. We need to make semiconductors.” The investigation into pharmaceutical imports includes ingredients used to make such drugs and touches on many of the same aspects of relying on imports to make them. Asked about his plans for more tariffs on pharmaceuticals, Trump said on Monday, “Yeah, we're going to be doing that.” He said it would be in the “not too distant future.” “We’re doing it because we want to make our own drugs,” he said. The United States is a major producer of semiconductors, but only in some areas. It relies heavily on imports from Taiwan and South Korea for certain kinds of advanced chips. In particular, Taiwan dominates advanced logic chip production at 92 percent of all fabrication capacity according to the International Trade Administration, with South Korea making 8 percent.

RTHK,international,Judge stops US move to revoke legal status of migrants,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800431-20250415.htm,"A federal judge has blocked US President Donald Trump's administration from quickly revoking the legal status of hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua and Haiti. The ruling by District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston on Monday is the latest order against Trump's rapid push to carry out mass deportations, particularly targeting Latin Americans. In March, the administration said it was moving to revoke the legal status of some 532,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who came to the United States under a ""parole"" programme initially launched by former president Joe Biden in October 2022. ""The court grants emergency relief staying the Termination of Parole Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans,"" Talwani wrote in her order. The parole programme allowed entry to the US for two years for up to 30,000 migrants per month from the four countries. In her order, Talwani said the Trump administration had acted on a flawed interpretation of immigration law, with expedited removal applicable to non-citizens entering the US illegally, but not those authorised to be in the country, such as through the parole programme. Under Trump's revocation, the immigrants would have lost their legal protection effective April 24, just 30 days after the Department of Homeland Security published its order in the Federal Register. Trump has vowed to deport ""millions"" of undocumented migrants in his second term, after running an election campaign that focused on illegal immigration. Among other measures, he has invoked rare wartime legislation to fly hundreds of alleged members of a Venezuelan gang to El Salvador, which is imprisoning the migrants. (AFP)","Tue, 15 Apr 2025 11:43:33 +0800","A federal judge has blocked US President Donald Trump's administration from quickly revoking the legal status of hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua and Haiti. The ruling by District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston on Monday is the latest order against Trump's rapid push to carry out mass deportations, particularly targeting Latin Americans. In March, the administration said it was moving to revoke the legal status of some 532,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who came to the United States under a ""parole"" programme initially launched by former president Joe Biden in October 2022. ""The court grants emergency relief staying the Termination of Parole Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans,"" Talwani wrote in her order. The parole programme allowed entry to the US for two years for up to 30,000 migrants per month from the four countries. In her order, Talwani said the Trump administration had acted on a flawed interpretation of immigration law, with expedited removal applicable to non-citizens entering the US illegally, but not those authorised to be in the country, such as through the parole programme. Under Trump's revocation, the immigrants would have lost their legal protection effective April 24, just 30 days after the Department of Homeland Security published its order in the Federal Register. Trump has vowed to deport ""millions"" of undocumented migrants in his second term, after running an election campaign that focused on illegal immigration.

RTHK,greater_china,'Trump will not win tariff war against China',https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800419-20250415.htm,"Renowned American economist, Jeffrey Sachs, on Tuesday said US President Donald Trump would not win the trade war against China, as Beijing is no longer as dependent on US markets as it was in the past. The remarks came as the world's two largest economies remain in a stand-off over sweeping tariffs that Washington imposed this month. Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Sachs, who teaches economics at Columbia University, said it was a ""mistake"" for the United States to launch the trade war. ""There's no doubt it started on the US side. The US actions violate international rules, and they violate economic sense. They will create costs, both for the US, for China, and for the rest of the world. But the biggest costs will be borne by the United States, especially US consumers,"" he said. ""The US consumers will face higher prices and lower living standards, that's why they're pessimistic. Some consumers are already cutting back on their consumption knowing that they're going to suffer a decline of living standards in future months, even with the risk of a recession."" ""[But] I think that the [consumer] costs in China will be much lower,"" he added. Noting that China's shipments to the US amounted to around US$440 billion last year, Sachs said that accounted for only a small share of the country's total US$3.68 trillion worth of exports in 2024. ""The truth is, the United States is not going to win this trade war, as China is just not as dependent on the US market as Donald Trump seems to think."" Separately, Sachs, who is also the director of Columbia’s Centre for Sustainable Development, noted the global trading system would remain open despite the sweeping tariffs. ""The open trading system will continue, but the United States might not be part of it, and this will be at a big cost to the United States, a big economic cost, a big development cost, and a big geopolitical cost.""","Tue, 15 Apr 2025 11:22:06 +0800","Renowned American economist, Jeffrey Sachs, on Tuesday said US President Donald Trump would not win the trade war against China, as Beijing is no longer as dependent on US markets as it was in the past.

Forward Semenyo clinically pounced on an early error on Monday from Cottagers captain Antonee Robinson to claim his 10th goal of the season and earn the Cherries a first win in seven league games. Evanilson went close to doubling the hosts' lead when he struck the woodwork before Andoni Iraola's men hung on to climb to eighth – above their opponents and Brighton on goal difference. Ryan Sessegnon squandered the best of Fulham's chances to equalise – heading straight at Kepa Arrizabalaga in the first half. Bournemouth had taken just two points from a possible 18 during a dramatic drop-off in form since going fifth with a 3-1 success at Southampton on February 15. But they were ahead inside a minute against their London opponents. Alex Scott led the counter attack following a loose pass from Timothy Castagne and, after Robinson's mistake, Semenyo nipped in to cut inside Joachim Andersen and curl the ball into the bottom-left corner. Evanilson rattled the crossbar from close range in the 16th minute while Fulham also looked dangerous going forward during an entertaining first half. Bournemouth boss Iraola brought on Illia Zabarnyi for Marcos Senesi at half-time and his side nearly doubled their lead 10 minutes after the re-start, when the legs of goalkeeper Bernd Leno denied Tyler Adams. Fulham manager Silva made three changes, bringing on Tom Cairney, Adama Traore and Raul Jimenez, with Sessegnon, Sander Berge and Rodrigo Muiz withdrawn.

It was the 11th human spaceflight for the Washington state-based company, founded by Bezos in 2000 after making a fortune with Amazon. Bezos strapped in for Blue Origin’s first space tourist flight in 2021 and accompanied the latest crew to the pad. The celebrity launch was the nation’s first spaceflight where women filled each seat. The only other all-female crew in 64 years of human spaceflight was back in 1963 when Soviet astronaut Valentina Tereshkova launched by herself, becoming the first woman in space. Tereshkova spent three days off the planet. Even after the latest launch, women represent barely 15 percent of the more than 700 people who have travelled into space.

Blue Origin declined to say how much the flight cost or who paid what. The trip came two months before Sanchez and Bezos marry in Venice. It was the 11th human spaceflight for the Washington state-based company, founded by Bezos in 2000 after making a fortune with Amazon. Bezos strapped in for Blue Origin’s first space tourist flight in 2021 and accompanied the latest crew to the pad. The celebrity launch was the nation’s first spaceflight where women filled each seat. The only other all-female crew in 64 years of human spaceflight was back in 1963 when Soviet astronaut Valentina Tereshkova launched by herself, becoming the first woman in space. Tereshkova spent three days off the planet. Even after the latest launch, women represent barely 15 percent of the more than 700 people who have travelled into space. (AP)",2025-04-15 09:08:21

""We are stepping up our support to the Palestinian people. 1.6 billion euros until 2027 will help stabilise the West Bank and Gaza,"" EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said. The EU is looking to boost the Palestinian Authority as Israel has resumed its war in Gaza after a ceasefire largely put a halt to the fighting for two months. ""This will reinforce the authority's ability to meet the needs of the Palestinian people in the West Bank and prepare it to return to govern Gaza once conditions allow,"" Kallas said. The EU foreign policy chief reiterated the bloc's condemnation over the ""total blockade of aid into Gaza"" and insistence that there was no military solution to the conflict. Mustafa said the international community faced a ""moment of truth"" over the situation in Gaza and the West Bank. ""We came to demand clarity from the international community,"" he said. Brussels - the biggest international donor to the Palestinians - said the package would include 620 million euros in grants for the Palestinian Authority. The funds will be linked to reforms on ""fiscal sustainability, democratic governance, private sector development and public infrastructure and services"", the EU said. The rest will be made up of 576 million euros in grants for projects aimed at helping economic recovery in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. A further 400 million euros in loans would come from the bloc's lending arm, the European Investment Bank. The EU's new package follows on from the previous three-year support plan worth 1.36 billion euros from 2021 to 2024.

RTHK,finance,Stocks rally worldwide after Trump eases some tariffs,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800379-20250415.htm,"Stocks rose worldwide on Monday after US President Donald Trump relaxed some of his tariffs, for now at least, and as stress from within the US bond market seems to be easing. The S&P 500 climbed 0.8 percent to 5,405, though trading was still shaky, and it briefly gave back all of its big early gain of 1.8 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose 0.8 percent to 40,524, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.6 percent to 16,831. Apple and other technology companies helped lift Wall Street after Trump said he was exempting smartphones, computers and other electronics from some of his stiff tariffs, which could ultimately more than double prices for US customers of products coming from China. Such an exemption would mean US importers don't have to choose between passing on the higher costs to their customers or taking a hit to their own profits. Apple climbed 2.2 percent, and Dell Technologies rose 4 percent. Automakers also rallied after Trump suggested he may announce pauses on tariffs next for the auto industry. General Motors rose 3.5 percent, and Ford Motor rallied 4.1 percent. Elsewhere on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs rose 1.9 percent after reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. It joined other big banks in doing so, such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. The bond market also showed signs of increasing calm. Treasury yields eased following their sudden rise last week. Treasury yields usually drop when fear is high in the market because US government bonds have historically been seen as some of the world’s safest investments, if not the safest. But last week, yields rose sharply for Treasury bonds in an usual move. The value of the US dollar also fell against other currencies in another move suggesting investors may no longer see the United States as the best place to keep their cash during moments of stress. The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased back to 4.37 percent. It had jumped to 4.48 percent on Friday from 4.01 percent the week before. The value of the US dollar, though, remained under pressure.

The meeting comes as the White House faces pressure over the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a father who was mistakenly deported to the jail in the Central American country. A federal judge ordered the government to ""facilitate"" Abrego Garcia's return to the United States, but Trump officials contend he is now solely in Salvadoran custody, leaving the man in legal limbo. Bukele addressed the issue in his meeting with Trump, saying he would not return Abrego Garcia. ""How can I return him to the United States? It's like, I smuggle him into the United States?...I don't have the power to return him to the United States,"" Bukele said. Bukele, known for his stylish dress sense and social media savvy, is broadly popular at home for clamping down on once rampant drug gangs that terrorised El Salvador. But the 43-year-old Salvadoran leader is accused of overseeing mass human rights violations, epitomised by a huge, brutal prison known as CECOT. Shortly after Trump's inauguration for a second term, Bukele made the extraordinary offer to take in prisoners from the United States. Trump took the Salvadoran leader up on his proposal, sending more than 250 migrants there after invoking a rarely used wartime law dating to 1798, which stripped the deportees of due process. Slickly produced footage of their arrival - including chained and tattooed men having their heads shaved and being frog-marched by masked guards - was widely promoted by both the Salvadoran and US governments. The Trump administration contends that the migrants are members of criminal gangs designated by the United States as terrorist organisations, including El Salvador's MS-13 and Venezuela's Tren de Aragua. However, relatives of several of the men contend they have no connection to organised crime and in some cases had been swept up simply because they had tattoos unrelated to any gang activity.

Lasting around 10 minutes, the flight will bring the passengers beyond the Karman line, the internationally recognized boundary of space. There will be a brief period when the women can unbuckle from their seats and float in zero gravity. Perry recently told Elle magazine that she was taking part ""for my daughter Daisy,"" whom she shares with actor Orlando Bloom, ""to inspire her to never have limits on her dreams.""

Monday's mission is the first all-woman space crew since Valentina Tereshkova's historic solo flight in 1963. It is also the 11th sub-orbital crewed operation by Blue Origin, which has offered the space tourism experiences for several years. Lasting around 10 minutes, the flight will bring the passengers beyond the Karman line, the internationally recognized boundary of space. There will be a brief period when the women can unbuckle from their seats and float in zero gravity. Perry recently told Elle magazine that she was taking part ""for my daughter Daisy,"" whom she shares with actor Orlando Bloom, ""to inspire her to never have limits on her dreams."" ""I'm just so excited to see the inspiration through her eyes and the light in her eyes when she sees that rocket go, and she goes back to school the next day and says 'Mom went to space',"" Perry added. She said in a separate video posted to Instagram that she was shocked to discover during space training that the capsule she will travel in was named the ""Tortoise"" and decorated with a ""feather"" design -- the two nicknames her parents have for her. ""There are no coincidences and I'm just so grateful for these confirmations and so grateful that I feel like something bigger than me is steering the ship,"" Perry said in the video.

RTHK,finance,HK stocks close up despite Trump's exemptions warning,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800333-20250414.htm,"Stocks rose on Monday as trade war fears were tempered by US President Donald Trump's announcement of tariff exemptions for electronics, although the greenback weakened and safe-haven gold hit a fresh record amid fears the relief would be short-lived. Hong Kong's stock market ended higher with the benchmark Hang Seng Index up 2.4 percent at 21,417.40. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 2.11 percent to end at 7,965.81, and the Hang Seng Tech Index rose 2.34 percent to end at 5,015.12. After the wild gyrations witnessed last week, markets got off to a relatively stable start following Friday's news that the White House would exempt smartphones, semiconductors, computers and other devices from painful ""reciprocal"" levies. The announcement provided a much-needed injection of optimism for investors who had been sent scurrying for the hills in the wake of the US president's tariff flip-flops and tit-for-tat measures by China. All three main indexes on Wall Street finished solidly higher, helped by comments from a top Federal Reserve official that the central bank was prepared to step in to support financial markets. Asia followed suit, with tech firms helping push Hong Kong more than two percent higher, while Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Wellington, Jakarta and Manila were also well up. London, Paris and Frankfurt also saw big gains in the morning, while US futures were all sharply higher. ""After a period of chaotic price action, chinks of light poke through the forest canopy providing a much-needed guide to the entities that price risk and liquidity for a living, which in turn, may see liquidity conditions improve and a relative calm return to markets,"" said Chris Weston at Pepperstone. However, Trump looked to temper the remarks on Sunday, saying the exemptions had been misconstrued and writing on his Truth Social platform that ""NOBODY is getting 'off the hook'... especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!"" He said he would announce new tariffs on semiconductors ""over the next week"". His commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said earlier chip levies would likely be in place ""in a month or two"". President Xi Jinping said on Monday that protectionism leads nowhere and that a trade war would have no winners, days after Beijing hit US goods with 125 percent duties but also suggested it would not retaliate further in the future.

It found that chamber representatives and around 70 percent of expats polled hold a neutral or positive attitude towards doing business in the SAR. “A lot of expats and the international business community are optimistic towards Hong Kong’s business environment, even though there is intense competition from other cities including Sydney, Dubai, Riyadh and Singapore,” said co-convenor Ray Poon.

RTHK,local,Global tech leaders call for stronger collaboration,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800300-20250414.htm,"Tech leaders from all over the world gathered in Hong Kong for the inaugural World Internet Conference Asia Pacific Summit on Monday, calling for stronger international partnerships in areas such as artificial intelligence, digital infrastructure and cybersecurity. The event brought in around 1,000 participants from governments, industries and technology organisations. In an opening-ceremony address, Hudaygulyyev Shihmyradowich, who chairs Turkmenistan’s state agency for communications and cybersecurity, said it's important to establish inclusive global cybersecurity standards amid the rapid advancement in artificial intelligence. “Artificial intelligence is a key factor for advancing the digital economy, and Turkmenistan is ready to actively work with all interested partners within the framework of international cooperation to ensure that the use of AI is accessible to all and brings real benefits to our citizens and global community,” he said. For his part, John Hoffman, chief executive of GSMA – a global trade association representing mobile network operators – said a community platform has been established to help firms explore AI use cases and set industry standards. “The group is currently made up of 12 industry players, and we’re grateful to have the support of these Chinese stakeholders, China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom, who have been pioneers in this space,” he said. “And as a global organisation representing the mobile ecosystem, we know how valuable these collaborations are and I can’t wait to see the innovation unlocked by the community.” Hoffman also highlighted the need for a structured framework to guide the responsible use of AI, saying 20 organisations, including two from China, have adopted GSMA’s framework. Meanwhile, the chairman of Ghana Dot Com Nii Quaynor, often known as the “father of the Internet in Africa”, stressed the importance of creating a digital world that benefits everyone. Quaynor, who established some of Africa’s first internet connections in the early 1990s, noted that while the continent’s internet user base is growing rapidly, it still faces barriers such as a fragile infrastructure. He warned of three divides that are holding the continent back in realising its AI potential. “First, technical capacities and educational preparedness for adoption needs to improve to avoid division. “Secondly, the cost of equipment and infrastructure for training AI imposes an economic divide on participation on the supply side of AI. “Lastly, the electrical power to run these machines limits the ability to participate beyond user level, not to mention the need for bandwidth to even load parameters of models,” he said. Quaynor said he hopes to explore cooperation opportunities through the summit and get his region more involved in the global tech supply chain.","Mon, 14 Apr 2025 16:02:00 +0800","Tech leaders from all over the world gathered in Hong Kong for the inaugural World Internet Conference Asia Pacific Summit on Monday, calling for stronger international partnerships in areas such as artificial intelligence, digital infrastructure and cybersecurity.

At a Legislative Council panel meeting, Lo Chung-mau fielded questions on the reform, which is set to take effect from January. Election committee representative Chan Wing-kwong noted that people seeking general outpatient services will soon have to pay HK$150 per consultation, triple the current amount. ""What factors do you consider when deciding on the new fee level?"" he asked. ""I understand there are fee waivers, but for those who are not eligible, how do you ensure they receive prompt medical assistance even when they are facing financial difficulties?"" In response, Lo said it was unreasonable to judge the reform simply by focusing on how much more patients will have to pay. He stressed the government’s goal is to gradually reduce the subsidy rate for public hospital services from 97.6 to 90 percent over five years. ""I wouldn't say a reduction to 90 percent is our ultimate goal either because the reform will continue,"" Lo said. ""We also need to evaluate the overall sustainability of Hong Kong's healthcare system and financing. ""Right now we’re adjusting the fees based on the subsidy rate. ""We wish to retain a higher subsidy rate for in-patient and complicated services, while the subsidy level will be lowered for outpatient and minor cases."" The health secretary added that the aim of the reform is to focus resources on helping the most critically ill patients, while 1.4 million people will benefit from a revamped fee waiver mechanism, up from the existing 300,000. But many lawmakers felt it was not easy for patients to find out if they are eligible for the waiver or which procedures will be covered. Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Kingsley Wong said people receiving welfare payments will obviously be eligible but noted there are only 600,000 or so of them. ""What about the remaining 800,000 people – how can they tell if they’re eligible too?"" he asked. David Lam, who represents the medical and health services sector, wanted to know if patients can pre-register for waivers or only find out whether they are eligible after a consultation.

Speaking on the sidelines of the summit, Keeson Technology, a leading Chinese manufacturer of high-tech beds and other sleep products, said the company will not give up on the American market despite tariff pressures. Chairman Jack Tang said that to mitigate the tariff impact, the company has diversified its supply chain across different regions, including Southeast Asia and North America. “We will focus on building our supply chain more reasonably because our products are very popular in the US market – in fact, we've captured over 50 percent of market share,” he said. “At its core, this isn't really about the trade war but about meeting essential consumer needs. ""With our current diversified setup, we believe we can effectively avoid the negative impacts of these trade tensions.” Fano Labs, a locally based AI startup that specialises in speech recognition and conversation analysis for fraud detection, said it has yet to feel any impact from the US tariffs. Co-founder and chief executive Miles Wen said that’s because of the company's software-based business model and global demand for its services. He said the company is also looking to tap new markets for growth opportunities. “I think there's a little bit of tension between the two big nations, but many other markets are more neutral and looking more towards economic growth,"" Wen said. ""That's where people can look at. ""That's also why we're looking at markets in Australia, Europe and Southeast Asia,” he said.

RTHK,international,Nobel literature laureate Vargas Llosa passes away,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1800240-20250414.htm,"Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, who enchanted readers with his intellectual rigor and lyrical prose for five decades and came close to being president of his country, has died aged 89. He passed away in the country's capital Lima surrounded by his family and ""at peace,"" his son Alvaro Vargas Llosa, a well-known political commentator, said. A leading light in the 20th century Latin American literature boom, Vargas Llosa won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2010 for works like ""Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter,"" ""Death in the Andes,"" and ""The War of the End of the World."" But early on he abandoned the socialist ideas that were embraced by many of his peers, and his dabbling in politics and conservative views annoyed much of Latin America's leftist intellectual class. In 1990, he ran for president of Peru, saying he wanted to save his country from economic chaos and a Marxist insurgency. He lost in the run-off to Alberto Fujimori, a then-unknown agronomist and university professor who defeated the insurgents but was later jailed for human rights crimes and corruption. Frustrated by his loss, the writer moved to Spain but remained influential in Latin America, where he harshly criticized a new wave of strident leftist leaders led by then-Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. In his dozens of novels, plays and essays, Vargas Llosa told stories from various viewpoints and experimented with form -moving back and forth in time and switching narrators. His work crossed genres and established him as a foundational figure in a generation of writers that led a resurgence in Latin American literature in the 1960s. His books often examined the unnerving relationships between leaders and their subjects. ""The Feast of the Goat"" (2000) details the brutal regime of Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo, while ""The War of the End of the World"" (1981) tells the true story of a fanatical preacher whose flock dies in a deadly war with Brazil's army in the 1890s. Born to middle-class parents in Arequipa, Peru, on March 28, 1936, Vargas Llosa lived in Bolivia and the Peruvian capital Lima. He later made a home in Madrid, but retained influence in Peru, where he wrote for newspapers about current events. Vargas Llosa frequently drew from personal experience and his family, at times inserting characters based on his own life into his tales. In the 1970s, Vargas Llosa, a one-time supporter of the Cuban revolution, denounced Fidel Castro, maddening many of his leftist literary colleagues like Colombian writer and fellow Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez. In 1976, the two had a famous argument, throwing punches outside a theater in Mexico City. A friend of Garcia Marquez said Vargas Llosa was upset that the Colombian had consoled his wife during an estrangement but Vargas Llosa refused to discuss it.

He passed away in the country's capital Lima surrounded by his family and ""at peace,"" his son Alvaro Vargas Llosa, a well-known political commentator, said. A leading light in the 20th century Latin American literature boom, Vargas Llosa won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2010 for works like ""Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter,"" ""Death in the Andes,"" and ""The War of the End of the World."" But early on he abandoned the socialist ideas that were embraced by many of his peers, and his dabbling in politics and conservative views annoyed much of Latin America's leftist intellectual class. In 1990, he ran for president of Peru, saying he wanted to save his country from economic chaos and a Marxist insurgency. He lost in the run-off to Alberto Fujimori, a then-unknown agronomist and university professor who defeated the insurgents but was later jailed for human rights crimes and corruption. Frustrated by his loss, the writer moved to Spain but remained influential in Latin America, where he harshly criticized a new wave of strident leftist leaders led by then-Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. In his dozens of novels, plays and essays, Vargas Llosa told stories from various viewpoints and experimented with form -moving back and forth in time and switching narrators. His work crossed genres and established him as a foundational figure in a generation of writers that led a resurgence in Latin American literature in the 1960s. His books often examined the unnerving relationships between leaders and their subjects. ""The Feast of the Goat"" (2000) details the brutal regime of Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo, while ""The War of the End of the World"" (1981) tells the true story of a fanatical preacher whose flock dies in a deadly war with Brazil's army in the 1890s. Born to middle-class parents in Arequipa, Peru, on March 28, 1936, Vargas Llosa lived in Bolivia and the Peruvian capital Lima. He later made a home in Madrid, but retained influence in Peru, where he wrote for newspapers about current events. Vargas Llosa frequently drew from personal experience and his family, at times inserting characters based on his own life into his tales. In the 1970s, Vargas Llosa, a one-time supporter of the Cuban revolution, denounced Fidel Castro, maddening many of his leftist literary colleagues like Colombian writer and fellow Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez. In 1976, the two had a famous argument, throwing punches outside a theater in Mexico City. A friend of Garcia Marquez said Vargas Llosa was upset that the Colombian had consoled his wife during an estrangement but Vargas Llosa refused to discuss it. (Reuters)",2025-04-14 10:11:45

He called such efforts necessary to ""inject more stability and positive energy into a chaotic and intertwined world"". ""There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars, and protectionism has no way out,"" Xi said. ""We must firmly safeguard the multilateral trading system, maintain the stability of the global industrial and supply chains, and maintain the international environment for open cooperation,"" he said.

And then he delivered another eagle late in the round as contenders were lining up behind him, a majestic 6-iron to 6 feet on the par-5 15th hole that carried him to a second straight 6-under 66. “It was an awesome day and puts me in a great position going into tomorrow,” McIlroy said. He led by two shots over a familiar foe — Bryson DeChambeau, who delivered some magic of his own with a 45-foot birdie putt to start his round and a putt from nearly 50 feet for birdie on the 18th hole that gave him a 69.

Mercedes rival George Russell was second fastest at the floodlit Sakhir desert circuit but was then handed a one-place grid drop, promoting Ferrari's Charles Leclerc to the front row instead. Italian rookie teammate Andrea Kimi Antonelli collected a similar penalty, after Mercedes released their drivers too early from a red flag stoppage, and dropped to fifth while Alpine's Pierre Gasly moved up to fourth on the grid. ""I've felt confident out there pretty much all weekend,"" said Piastri, who was also fastest in two out of three practice sessions and lapped with a best time of one minute 29.841 seconds. ""The others caught up a little bit closer than what I wanted but I still delivered the laps when it mattered, which was the most important thing at the end."" Piastri, winner in China from pole, could become the first double winner of the season and looks set to slash the 13-point gap to Norris, who is only one clear of Red Bull's reigning champion Max Verstappen. Norris said the Australian deserved his pole. ""The car is amazing, as good as it has been all season which is strong. Just I have been off it all weekend,"" Norris told reporters. ""I don't know why, just clueless on track at the minute. Just not quick enough, simple as that."" The only positive for Norris was having Verstappen end up in seventh place for Red Bull at a track where the four-times champion was utterly dominant last year. Verstappen said he had been struggling with the brakes and lack of grip. ""I have no idea where we will be in terms of race pace. We'll be in the middle of the pack so hopefully a bit of excitement,"" he added. Carlos Sainz qualified eighth for Williams, at a track where he was quickest in pre-season testing, with Ferrari's seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton ninth and Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda 10th. It was the first time this season that both Red Bulls had reached the top 10 shootout, although they flirted with an early exit in Q1 and Q2 when they left it until the last minute to set a time. ""Obviously as a driver you want more but considering what I had in practice, and it’s only my second race (for Red Bull), I’ll still take it,"" said Tsunoda, who replaced Liam Lawson after the opening two races. Esteban Ocon crashed his Haas in the second phase, triggering red flags after he careered backwards across the gravel into the barriers. The Frenchman took his time clambering out and was taken away in the medical car. Australian rookie Jack Doohan qualified his Alpine 11th, his best session yet, and one place ahead of Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar. Alex Albon failed to make it through the opening phase for the first time this season, the Williams driver qualifying only 16th. Albon was then promoted to 15th when Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg had his lap deleted for exceeding track limits while already taking part in a second phase he was then excluded from. Stewards said they had been informed of the violation too late to stop him progressing at Albon's expense. Hadjar's teammate Lawson had another difficult evening and was only 17th.

Italian rookie teammate Andrea Kimi Antonelli collected a similar penalty, after Mercedes released their drivers too early from a red flag stoppage, and dropped to fifth while Alpine's Pierre Gasly moved up to fourth on the grid. ""I've felt confident out there pretty much all weekend,"" said Piastri, who was also fastest in two out of three practice sessions and lapped with a best time of one minute 29.841 seconds. ""The others caught up a little bit closer than what I wanted but I still delivered the laps when it mattered, which was the most important thing at the end."" Piastri, winner in China from pole, could become the first double winner of the season and looks set to slash the 13-point gap to Norris, who is only one clear of Red Bull's reigning champion Max Verstappen. Norris said the Australian deserved his pole. ""The car is amazing, as good as it has been all season which is strong. Just I have been off it all weekend,"" Norris told reporters. ""I don't know why, just clueless on track at the minute. Just not quick enough, simple as that."" The only positive for Norris was having Verstappen end up in seventh place for Red Bull at a track where the four-times champion was utterly dominant last year. Verstappen said he had been struggling with the brakes and lack of grip. ""I have no idea where we will be in terms of race pace. We'll be in the middle of the pack so hopefully a bit of excitement,"" he added. Carlos Sainz qualified eighth for Williams, at a track where he was quickest in pre-season testing, with Ferrari's seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton ninth and Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda 10th. It was the first time this season that both Red Bulls had reached the top 10 shootout, although they flirted with an early exit in Q1 and Q2 when they left it until the last minute to set a time. ""Obviously as a driver you want more but considering what I had in practice, and it’s only my second race (for Red Bull), I’ll still take it,"" said Tsunoda, who replaced Liam Lawson after the opening two races. Esteban Ocon crashed his Haas in the second phase, triggering red flags after he careered backwards across the gravel into the barriers. The Frenchman took his time clambering out and was taken away in the medical car. Australian rookie Jack Doohan qualified his Alpine 11th, his best session yet, and one place ahead of Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar. Alex Albon failed to make it through the opening phase for the first time this season, the Williams driver qualifying only 16th. Albon was then promoted to 15th when Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg had his lap deleted for exceeding track limits while already taking part in a second phase he was then excluded from. Stewards said they had been informed of the violation too late to stop him progressing at Albon's expense. Hadjar's teammate Lawson had another difficult evening and was only 17th.

""Tonight, the state of South Carolina executed him by firing squad -- a horrifying act that belongs in the darkest chapters of history, not in a civilized society,"" defence lawyer David Weiss said in a statement. ""Mikal died in full view of a system that failed him at every turn -- from childhood to his final breath.""

Colonel Susannah Meyers, who had served as commander of the Pituffik Space Base since July, was removed after reports she distanced herself and the base from US Vice President JD Vance's criticism of Denmark and its oversight of the territory during his visit two weeks ago. ""Commanders are expected to adhere to the highest standards of conduct, especially as it relates to remaining nonpartisan in the performance of their duties,"" the US Space Force said in a statement late Thursday. The statement did not expand further, but US website Military.com said Meyers sent a March 31 email to all personnel at Pituffik ""seemingly aimed at generating unity among the airmen and guardians, as well as the Canadians, Danes and Greenlanders who work there"" following Vance's appearance."" During his March 28 visit to the base, Vance told a press conference, ""Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland."" Both Nuuk and Copenhagen viewed the visit as a provocation. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on social media, ""We are open to criticisms, but let me be completely honest, we do not appreciate the tone in which it's being delivered.""

Colonel Susannah Meyers, who had served as commander of the Pituffik Space Base since July, was removed after reports she distanced herself and the base from US Vice President JD Vance's criticism of Denmark and its oversight of the territory during his visit two weeks ago. ""Commanders are expected to adhere to the highest standards of conduct, especially as it relates to remaining nonpartisan in the performance of their duties,"" the US Space Force said in a statement late Thursday.

Trump, who turns 79 in June and likes fast food so much he staged a photo op at a McDonald's during his campaign last year, spent several hours being poked and prodded by the doctors at Walter Reed Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. ""It went, I think, well ... every test you can imagine, I was there for a long time, the yearly physical,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. ""I think I did well. I think they're releasing the report on Sunday,"" he added. Trump also said he took a cognitive exam and got all the answers right. ""Overall I felt I was in very good shape. A good heart, a good soul, a very good soul and I took — I wanted to be a little different than Biden. I took a cognitive test and I don't know what to tell you other than I got every answer right,"" Trump said. The physical could offer the first clear look at Trump's condition since his ear was grazed by a bullet in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last July. His campaign released a report by Ronny Jackson, Trump's former White House doctor and a Republican Congressman from Texas, saying the injuries were superficial. The White House typically determines what data will be released from a president's health exam and earlier in the day Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said results will be released as soon as possible. Trump is not compelled to release any information, and there is no template for the presidential exam. Trump released only limited information about his health during his presidential campaigns. During the 2024 election, Trump drew sharp contrasts with his predecessor, Joe Biden, now 82, claiming he was younger and fitter. A White House doctor in 2018, when Trump was serving his first term, said the president was in overall excellent health but needed to shed weight and start a daily exercise routine. When asked on Friday if the medical team had suggested any changes to his habits, the president said that they had ""a little bit"", but did not elaborate further. Trump included a cognitive exam, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, as part of his physical during his first term, and his doctor later said he scored 30 out of 30. Biden released detailed summaries of his physical exams while in office, but several books published in recent months have raised questions about his mental acuity in his final months in the White House. The mental ability and age of both Biden and Trump were in focus during last year's election campaign, especially after Biden's disastrous performance in a debate with Trump in June, and Trump's increasingly rambling speeches at rallies.

On the prospect of winning the title in front of a full Anfield, Salah said ""that's something that drives me crazy every day – to come to work and push myself and push the other players also, because we are closer than ever now that we can win it in a special way."" Liverpool manager Arne Slot has also had to deal with persistent questioning over the futures of captain Virgil van Dijk and right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold, who are also out of contract at the end of the campaign, during his first season in charge.

The Egyptian was part of the Liverpool side that delivered the club's first league title for 30 years in the 2019/20 season. But Covid restrictions meant that the Reds lifted the trophy in front of an empty Anfield and there was no parade through the city's streets. ""I think I said in the beginning of the season, I just want to win the Premier League more than anything else,"" Salah told Liverpool's website. ""I want it so bad. ""I think we owe that to the fans. They deserve it, they deserve to enjoy it after that long time, with celebrating at Anfield and in the street and just enjoying ourselves winning the Premier League."" On the prospect of winning the title in front of a full Anfield, Salah said ""that's something that drives me crazy every day – to come to work and push myself and push the other players also, because we are closer than ever now that we can win it in a special way."" Liverpool manager Arne Slot has also had to deal with persistent questioning over the futures of captain Virgil van Dijk and right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold, who are also out of contract at the end of the campaign, during his first season in charge. The Dutchman said news of Salah's new deal may have come as a ""pleasant surprise"" for supporters but praised the club's sporting director Richard Hughes for ensuring the Egyptian remains at Anfield. ""I don't think it's a surprise to you that I knew a bit better how his contract situation went over the course of the whole season,"" said Slot. ""Maybe for the fans it was a pleasant surprise. I knew it a bit longer, of course, that things were heading in the right direction. ""I think it's also a big compliment for Richard that he achieved to extend Mo Salah, who is such a great player as a free agent, that he can go probably to every club in the world wherever he wants to. ""But he stayed at our club and that's also a compliment for Richard."" (AFP)",2025-04-11 18:04:58
RTHK,international,Yoon in emotional exit from official residence,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799965-20250411.htm,"Former South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol returned to his private home on Friday from the official residence after his removal from office, with crowds of supporters turning out to greet his motorcade. The Constitutional Court upheld Yoon's impeachment last Friday, capping four months of unprecedented constitutional turmoil after his short-lived attempt to impose martial law in December sent shockwaves through Asia's fourth-largest economy. South Korea will now hold a snap election on June 3, and questions remain over whether Yoon might still play a role given how his impeachment appears to have deepened polarisation in society and stirred up his conservative supporters. Hundreds had gathered outside the gates of the official residence, where Yoon briefly stopped to hug and shake hands with supporters, some of whom were crying. The ousted president has not been seen in public since he was released from prison on March 8 when a court cancelled his detention warrant in the criminal case against him. He did not attend the impeachment ruling by the Constitutional Court on April 4. But a number of his ruling party members and supporters have been seen visiting the official residence where Yoon reportedly discussed the upcoming election. As he left the official residence, Yoon donned a red baseball cap saying ""Make Korea Great Again"" given to him by a supporter, video footage showed. ""Now I will go back to being one of the people... and find a new way for the country and the people,"" Yoon said. He and his wife were driven in a motorcade from the official presidential residence to their private apartment in a 37-storey building in Seoul. The pet-loving couple will also take back more than 10 dogs and cats they own. Some 280 police were deployed around his private home on Friday ahead of the move, and Yoon is to be accompanied by a security detail of about 50 people, media reported. The former president still faces trial on a criminal charge of leading an insurrection, which is punishable by death or a life sentence if he is convicted. The race to replace Yoon kicked off this week with nearly 20 hopefuls expected to contest for the candidacy of the conservative People Power Party that is in a fight to retain the presidency against a populist liberal who leads in the polls.

RTHK,local,Warning system in works for HK's flood-prone roads,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799958-20250411.htm,"The government on Friday announced a pilot scheme to install flood-warning systems at five flood-prone areas to prevent vehicles from being stranded during severe rainstorms. The Wading Line System will be set up at Chai Wan Road, Lung Cheung Road in Wong Tai Sin, Tsui Ping Road in Kwun Tong, Chatham Road North in Ho Man Tin and Nam Wan Road in Tai Po Market. These five low-lying road sections were heavily flooded during what were described as ""once-in-500-years"" deluges in September 2023, officials said. The system comes with red wavy lines painted on roads, water level markers and real-time monitoring equipment. Drainage officials will also install flood-monitoring devices at the lowest points of the road sections to collect real-time water level data. When the water level reaches 0.1 metres, staff from the Drainage Services and Highways departments will be deployed to clear blocked drains. Traffic will be diverted on site when the water level reaches 0.3 metres. If water rises above this level, it can seriously damage vehicles. When officials get a flood warning, they will send teams to the site within 15 to 30 minutes. With installation work starting in late April and expected to be completed by mid-May, the five pilot projects cost around HK$700,000, a government spokesperson said. Officials will examine the scheme's effectiveness before deciding on the next step.","Fri, 11 Apr 2025 17:27:47 +0800","The government on Friday announced a pilot scheme to install flood-warning systems at five flood-prone areas to prevent vehicles from being stranded during severe rainstorms.

RTHK,finance,HK stocks end up as Beijing has last say on tariffs,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799960-20250411.htm,"The US dollar tumbled along with most stocks while gold hit a fresh record high as panic gripped markets again on Friday, while China retaliated against Donald Trump's latest tariff blitz against the world's number two economy. Beijing raised the tariffs on US imports to 125 percent near the end of trading in stocks in Hong Kong. The benchmark Hang Seng Index ended up 1.13 percent to close at 20,914.69. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 1.74 percent to end at 7,801.51 while the Hang Seng Tech Index climbed 1.8 percent to end at 4,900.43. The US president's decision to delay crippling duties for 90 days sparked a frenzied scramble for equities that had been beaten down since his ""Liberation Day"" announcement unleashed a global panic. However, the realisation that nothing had been resolved, coupled with Trump's decision to double down on his battle with economic superpower China, fuelled another bout of selling of US assets. The greenback tanked against the yen, euro, pound and Swiss franc – investors dropping what is usually considered a key safe haven currency as they look to unload US risk assets. Gold-standard Treasuries were also under pressure amid speculation that China was offloading some of its vast holdings in retaliation for Trump's measures. The weaker dollar and the rush for safety has also sent bullion to a fresh record high above US$3,220. Ahead of Beijing's latest tariffs move made in response to Trump, President Xi Jinping urged the European Union to join Beijing in resisting ""unilateral bullying"" by Washington, state media said as he met Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. Shortly after, Beijing said it would ramp up levies against the United States to 125 percent, compared with the 145 percent China faces. It added that Washington's moves defied ""basic economic laws and common sense"" and ""seriously violates international trade rules"" but said it would ""ignore"" future US hikes. Markets across the region were back deep in negative territory at the end of a highly volatile week. Tokyo shed 3 percent – a day after surging more than 9 percent – while Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Wellington and Bangkok were also in the red. However, Hong Kong and Shanghai rose as traders focused on possible Chinese stimulus measures.

""China and Europe should fulfil their international responsibilities... and jointly resist unilateral bullying practices,"" Xi said.

The president added there is no winner in a tariff war, and going against the world will only result in self-isolation. He said for more than 70 years, China has achieved development through self-reliance and does not fear unreasonable suppression. Xi added that no matter how the external world changes, China will remain confident and focused on running its own affairs well. Sanchez, in turn, said following the meeting in Beijing that tensions over trade should not impede cooperation between China and the EU.

RTHK,greater_china,China raises tariffs on US goods to 125pc,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799950-20250411.htm,"China blasted US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Friday as a ""numbers game"" that ""will become a joke"", as Beijing raised levies on US imports to 125 percent and said it would go no further. The announcement followed the US move to raise the ""reciprocal tariffs"" on Chinese imports to 125 percent, bringing the total to 145 percent. The State Council's Customs Tariff Commission said the US imposition of excessively high tariffs on China seriously violates international economic and trade rules, goes against basic economic laws and common sense, and is nothing but unilateral bullying and coercion. The commission said even if Washington is to raise tariffs further, it would no longer make economic sense and ultimately go down as a joke in world economic history. ""Given that it's already impossible for the Chinese market to accept US imports at the current tariff level, if the United States imposes further tariffs on Chinese products, China will ignore it,"" it said. Washington's duties on Chinese products have ""become a numbers game with no practical significance in economics"", a spokesperson for the Commerce Ministry said. The 125 percent tariffs on US goods are up from 84 percent, and will take effect from Saturday. The Commerce Ministry also said China has filed a lawsuit against the US with the World Trade Organization's dispute settlement mechanism following the latest American tariff hikes. The countermeasure by Beijing came after US President Donald Trump's latest escalation in a tit-for-tat trade war that he started by singling China out even as he hit a pause on additional tariffs for other countries.

RTHK,local,Trump levy looms larger for senders of small parcels,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799912-20250411.htm,"Hong Kong is continuing to see fallout from the trade war started by US President Donald Trump who raised the duty on small goods parcels from the SAR to 120 percent from the 90 percent that he had set just a day before that, and the 30 percent in his opening salvo on April 2. Trump made the amendment in an executive order that went public on Thursday Hong Kong time. Tariffs on parcels will go up from US$75 to US$100 from May 2 and from US$150 to US$200 from June 1. The jump in tariffs closes a trade exemption rule known de minimis that has allowed low-value packages from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to enter the United States free of duties. It means people wanting to send small parcels worth up to US$800, which are currently exempt from any duties, to the US from the mainland, Hong Kong or Macau will now have to pay US$100 per item posted between May 2 and before June 1 and US$200 for goods sent after June 1. The skyrocketing increase in duties comes as the number of shipments entering the US through the duty-free route has exploded in recent years, reaching nearly 1.4 billion packages last year. More than 90 percent of these packages now enter under the de minimis rule, and of those, about 60 percent come from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein. The jump in duties on small goods parcels has been framed by Trump as a solution to the national emergency arising from the US trade deficits and in his starting a tit-for-tat trade war that has seen him levy a punitive 145 percent tariff on Chinese imports.

Lazio arrived on Thursday in a windy Bodo to find snow had blanketed the pitch in the early hours.

The match – set for May 30 at Hong Kong Stadium – is part of the Red Devils’ post-season Asia tour, which kicks off with a stop in Kuala Lumpur. It marks the Premier League side’s return to the SAR after 12 years. They last visited the city in 2013, when they defeated local club Kitchee 5-2. At a press event held a day before tickets went on sale, Manchester United’s Director of Tour and Friendlies Christoffer Komen said the lineup is still being finalised, but promised the team will put on a show. He noted key players are not required for international duty until June and that a “full team” should be coming to the SAR. “You can be confident to see our stars, of course led by our team captain Bruno, we’ve also got all the players lined up currently to join us on a plane,” Komen said. There was backlash last year over Lionel Messi’s no-show at an exhibition match in the SAR, which left local supporters frustrated. At the press event, Eric Fok, chairman of the Football Association of Hong Kong, China welcomed the Red Devils’ return, calling it an opportunity to attract football enthusiasts across Asia.

The match – set for May 30 at Hong Kong Stadium – is part of the Red Devils’ post-season Asia tour, which kicks off with a stop in Kuala Lumpur. It marks the Premier League side’s return to the SAR after 12 years. They last visited the city in 2013, when they defeated local club Kitchee 5-2. At a press event held a day before tickets went on sale, Manchester United’s Director of Tour and Friendlies Christoffer Komen said the lineup is still being finalised, but promised the team will put on a show. He noted key players are not required for international duty until June and that a “full team” should be coming to the SAR. “You can be confident to see our stars, of course led by our team captain Bruno, we’ve also got all the players lined up currently to join us on a plane,” Komen said. There was backlash last year over Lionel Messi’s no-show at an exhibition match in the SAR, which left local supporters frustrated. At the press event, Eric Fok, chairman of the Football Association of Hong Kong, China welcomed the Red Devils’ return, calling it an opportunity to attract football enthusiasts across Asia.

RTHK,finance,HK stocks keep rising despite Trump's China escalation,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799800-20250410.htm,"Stocks rocketed on Thursday as a relief rally spread through markets after Donald Trump paused crippling tariffs on US partners, with Chinese investors even brushing off his decision to ramp up duties on Beijing to 125 percent. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index ended up 2.06 percent at 20,681.78. That marks a third day of gains after it collapsed more than 13 percent on Monday in its worst day since 1997 during the Asian financial crisis. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 1.76 percent to end at 7,668.38, and the Hang Seng Tech Index climbed 2.66 percent to end at 4,813.74. The across-the-board gains by markets tracked a blistering performance on Wall Street as the US president said he would delay for 90 days measures announced last week that set off a firestorm on trading floors and sparked global recession fears. Trump said he would keep in place a basic levy of 10 percent on dozens of countries but upped the ante in his brutal trade war with superpower rival China by hitting it even harder after it retaliated. China's own 84 percent retaliatory measures kicked in on Thursday, later saying that the United States ""goes against the whole world"" with the measures. Tokyo's Nikkei surged more than 9 percent, while Taipei's 9.3 percent gain was its best rise on record – after Monday's 9.7 percent drop represented its worst fall.

However, the latest reversal still leaves its trading partners facing 10 percent baseline tariffs.

He indicated that China, as a major economy, could roll out stimulus measures to mitigate the tariffs' impact as the nation still has ample policy room and tools to cope. ""Our country has made its stance clear: we are open to resolving trade conflicts through dialogue based on mutual respect, not intimidation,"" he said.

Data centres represented about 1.5 percent of global electricity consumption in 2024, but that has increased by 12 percent annually over the past five years. Generative AI requires colossal computing power to process information accumulated in gigantic databases.

RTHK,international,S Korean opposition leader opens presidential bid,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799740-20250410.htm,"South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, widely seen as the frontrunner in a presidential by-election triggered by the removal of President Yoon Suk Yeol last week, officially announced a presidential bid on Thursday, vowing to heal a starkly divided nation through economic growth. Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, led the liberal Democratic Party’s campaign to oust the former president over his December declaration of martial law. Lee recently stepped down as the party’s chairman to focus on campaigning for the June 3 election. He is considered the clear frontrunner in party's primary. Kim Dong-yeon, the Democratic governor of Gyeonggi province and a longtime financial policymaker, also told reporters on Wednesday that he intends to run for president. Yoon’s downfall has left the conservative People Power Party in disarray, with roughly 10 politicians expected to seek the nomination, reflecting a split between Yoon loyalists, who still control the party’s leadership, and reformists calling for a fresh start. In a video message, Lee said that Yoon’s martial law saga exposed the country’s deep divisions and social conflicts, and argued that the root cause was a widening rich-poor gap. He promised aggressive government spending to jolt economic growth and ease income polarisation. “We have more than we did in the past, but wealth is too concentrated in certain areas,” Lee said. “With economic growth rates declining worldwide, it has become difficult to maintain and develop an economy solely on the strength of the private sector. However, with government-led talent development and extensive investments in technological research and development, we can revive the economy.” He also said it was crucial to maintain a robust alliance with the United States and to pursue three-way cooperation with Japan, but he stressed that South Korea’s national interest should come first in “every decision”. Lee, who has served as a lawmaker, provincial governor and city mayor, is adored by supporters for his outspoken style and has long positioned himself as an anti-elitist. His critics view him as a populist who stokes division and demonises conservative opponents, while failing to offer realistic funding plans to achieve his ambitious goals.

Incorporating tropes familiar to followers of the far-right QAnon movement, conspiratorial social media posts about the Liberal leader have surged ahead of the country's April 28 election. Posts range from false claims he recited a ""satanic chant"" at a campaign event to AI-generated images of him in a pool with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. ""He's the ideal person to be targeted here, for sure, due to his background, as well as his financial work,"" said Ahmed Al-Rawi, an associate professor of communications at Canada's Simon Fraser University. Before serving as governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, Carney had a lucrative career as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs. Mentioning a candidate's affiliation with the global financial elite, and particularly the World Economic Forum, has become a dog whistle for the right.

Many posts have zeroed in on a picture from a festival in Britain showing Carney and his wife standing next to Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell. This 2013 photo is authentic, but it precipitated the spread of several AI-generated images shared to emphasize a supposed link between Carney and Epstein.

Al-Rawi said for conspiracy theorists, a grain of truth mixed with fabricated evidence is enough for a claim to truly take hold. A spokesman with the Carney campaign said the claims being spread were ""false and disinformation"" and said any insinuated connection with Maxwell was incorrect. ""She went to high school with Mark Carney's wife's sister,"" he said. ""Although they may have bumped into each other in public settings, they are not friends."" Experts said engagement with the claims appears to be somewhat contained to groups already critical of Carney's Liberal Party.

The factory, which opened on Wednesday in an industrial area close to Ho Chi Minh City, is the first in Vietnam that aims to run entirely on clean energy. Lego says it will do that by early 2026. It's the Danish company's sixth worldwide and its second in Asia. It will use high-tech equipment to produce colourful Lego bricks for Southeast Asia’s growing markets. “We just want to make sure that the planet that the children inherit when they grow up needs to be a planet that is still there,” Lego CEO Niels Christiansen said. The factory is an important factor in Lego's quest to stop adding greenhouse gases by 2050. It has a shorter-term target of reducing emissions by 37 percent by 2032. The privately-held group, which currently makes its bricks out of oil-based plastic, says it has invested more than US$1.2 billion in a search for more sustainable alternatives. But those efforts have not always been successful. Vietnam also aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, so it needs more of its factories to use clean energy.

RTHK,sport,Doncic loss hits home for Dallas in emotional return,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799727-20250410.htm,"Luka Doncic shrugged off the raw emotion of his return to Dallas with a dazzling 45-point display against his former club as the Los Angeles Lakers downed the Mavericks 112-97 to punch their ticket to the NBA playoffs. Doncic, who joined the Lakers from Dallas in February in one of the most shocking trades in NBA history, was given a rousing reception by Mavs fans packed into the American Airlines Center to pay tribute to their former hero on Wednesday. A pre-game video montage was screened in the arena just before Doncic was introduced to the sellout crowd of 20,841 fans, many wearing t-shirts bearing the words ""Thanks for Everything"", written in the 26-year-old's native Slovenian. Doncic visibly teared up as he watched the tribute, and looked distraught as he was comforted by Lakers team-mate LeBron James moments before tip-off. But after that emotional pre-game ceremony, Doncic quickly snapped into game mode, swiftly getting into his scoring groove to give Mavericks fans a painful reminder of the generational talent that was traded away by the club. Doncic scored 14 in the first quarter alone, and added a further 17 in the second period to help the Lakers into a 60-57 half-time lead. Doncic's rate of scoring slowed in the second half, leaving James to produce a trademark fourth quarter burst to close out victory. But there was still time for Doncic to sign off in style, nailing an imperious three-pointer to push the Lakers into a 108-94 lead shortly before exiting the game to a standing ovation. The applause swiftly morphed into chants of ""Fire Nico"" – a reference to the Dallas general manager Nico Harrison who has been roundly criticised by Mavs for engineering the trade that sent Doncic to Los Angeles in exchange for Anthony Davis. Doncic later admitted he had struggled to maintain his composure during the pre-game ceremony. ""I don't know how I did it because when I was watching that video I was like 'There's no way I'm playing this game',"" he told ESPN. ""But all my teammates had my back and were really supporting me.

(AFP)","Thu, 10 Apr 2025 11:13:03 +0800","Luka Doncic shrugged off the raw emotion of his return to Dallas with a dazzling 45-point display against his former club as the Los Angeles Lakers downed the Mavericks 112-97 to punch their ticket to the NBA playoffs. Doncic, who joined the Lakers from Dallas in February in one of the most shocking trades in NBA history, was given a rousing reception by Mavs fans packed into the American Airlines Center to pay tribute to their former hero on Wednesday. A pre-game video montage was screened in the arena just before Doncic was introduced to the sellout crowd of 20,841 fans, many wearing t-shirts bearing the words ""Thanks for Everything"", written in the 26-year-old's native Slovenian. Doncic visibly teared up as he watched the tribute, and looked distraught as he was comforted by Lakers team-mate LeBron James moments before tip-off. But after that emotional pre-game ceremony, Doncic quickly snapped into game mode, swiftly getting into his scoring groove to give Mavericks fans a painful reminder of the generational talent that was traded away by the club. Doncic scored 14 in the first quarter alone, and added a further 17 in the second period to help the Lakers into a 60-57 half-time lead. Doncic's rate of scoring slowed in the second half, leaving James to produce a trademark fourth quarter burst to close out victory. But there was still time for Doncic to sign off in style, nailing an imperious three-pointer to push the Lakers into a 108-94 lead shortly before exiting the game to a standing ovation. The applause swiftly morphed into chants of ""Fire Nico"" – a reference to the Dallas general manager Nico Harrison who has been roundly criticised by Mavs for engineering the trade that sent Doncic to Los Angeles in exchange for Anthony Davis. Doncic later admitted he had struggled to maintain his composure during the pre-game ceremony. ""I don't know how I did it because when I was watching that video I was like 'There's no way I'm playing this game',"" he told ESPN. ""But all my teammates had my back and were really supporting me. ""There were so many emotions I can't even explain. ""It brought tears to my eyes. ""I came here as a young kid, aged 18, and they made me feel like it was home. ""Just a lot of great memories.

The Dow Jones surged 7.9 percent to 40,608, and the S&P 500 rallied 9.5 percent to 5,456. The Nasdaq jumped 12.2 percent to 17,124. All three indexes bounced on Wednesday afternoon as Trump announced a 90-day pause in country-specific tariffs that came into place earlier that day, except levies on Chinese goods. Affected US trading partners, excluding China, would instead face a 10 percent tariff rate, temporarily reverting to a level that took effect over the weekend, though that already roiled markets. Trump singled out the world's second biggest economy, however, saying its tariff rate would be raised to a prohibitive 125 percent ""based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the world's markets."" ""When markets are pricing in worst-case scenarios, it doesn't take much good news to turn that opinion around,"" said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management. He added that investors were waiting for any sense of a more reasonable trade process, saying this situation might ""be less of a drag on economic activity and earnings.""

The new US$75 duty will take effect on parcels sent from May 2 and before June 1, which was the period when the original US$25 levy was to come into play.

With the amendment, the per postal item fee will also be tripled to US$150 from the planned US$50 that was to go into effect after June 1. The new tariff came into play as Trump made good on his punitive measure against China after it had reciprocated his 34 percent tariffs by a similar quantum. That brought his latest tariffs to 84 percent, making the total, on top of the 20 percent in levies imposed in February and March, 104 percent.

RTHK,local,Revamped HK$2 subsidy scheme to take effect earlier,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799608-20250409.htm,"The government said changes to the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme will be in place sooner than expected. Those changes were unveiled by Financial Secretary Paul Chan in his budget address in February, and officials have said it would take about 18 months to adjust Octopus machines to accommodate the new fares. Under the plan, fares for more expensive routes will be higher than HK$2, with elderly and disabled passengers paying 20 percent of trips that cost more than HK$10. Welfare minister Chris Sun told lawmakers on Wednesday that the changes could be implemented in about 12 months' time thanks to efforts by transport operators and the Octopus Cards Limited. ""We can now say with certainty that the HK$2, or 20 percent of fare, will be implemented in April 2026, which is five months earlier than the original estimate,"" he said at a special finance committee meeting on the budget. Sun said this would mean extra savings of HK$260 million in public coffers. He also said the move to cap the number of HK$2 subsidised trips to 240 per person each month will be in effect about two years from now. Election Committee councillor Carmen Kan asked whether officials can implement the updated scheme even quicker. Sun said the administration is already taking the least amount of time possible, because officials still have to manually adjust every single machine on vehicles. For his part, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien asked whether officials could bring in more measures – such as tougher penalties or new laws – to tackle abuse or misuse of the JoyYou Card for the elderly. Sun said officials had already raised the penalty for people using the card and posing as someone else, adding that some suspects were taken to court.","Wed, 09 Apr 2025 16:51:29 +0800","The government said changes to the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme will be in place sooner than expected.

Welfare minister Chris Sun told lawmakers on Wednesday that the changes could be implemented in about 12 months' time thanks to efforts by transport operators and the Octopus Cards Limited. ""We can now say with certainty that the HK$2, or 20 percent of fare, will be implemented in April 2026, which is five months earlier than the original estimate,"" he said at a special finance committee meeting on the budget. Sun said this would mean extra savings of HK$260 million in public coffers. He also said the move to cap the number of HK$2 subsidised trips to 240 per person each month will be in effect about two years from now. Election Committee councillor Carmen Kan asked whether officials can implement the updated scheme even quicker. Sun said the administration is already taking the least amount of time possible, because officials still have to manually adjust every single machine on vehicles. For his part, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien asked whether officials could bring in more measures – such as tougher penalties or new laws – to tackle abuse or misuse of the JoyYou Card for the elderly. Sun said officials had already raised the penalty for people using the card and posing as someone else, adding that some suspects were taken to court.",2025-04-09 16:51:29

However, they warned that those investors who saw market downturns as an opportunity and went along with market momentum could find themselves on the short end of the stick as a result of volatilities. Their remarks came as the benchmark Hang Seng Index slumped 1.6 percent to 19,815 at the noon trading break, just as the new tariffs by the United States took effect. The decline marked the index's lowest level since January 23, while the Hang Seng Tech Index fell 1 percent and mainland shares also returned to the red.

The contest pivoted on the fourth quarter incident that led to the Lakers' Slovenian star Doncic picking up a second technical foul and being tossed from the game.

""It was a great game that unfortunately didn't get the finish that I think every basketball fan would want because of some decision making on some individuals' parts,"" Lakers coach J J Redick said.

RTHK,sport,Arsenal stun Real Madrid with Rice's free-kick magic,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799541-20250409.htm,"Mikel Arteta admitted Arsenal defied the odds with their stunning 3-0 win against Real Madrid as Declan Rice's free-kick magic left the Champions League holders in disarray. Rice inspired one of the greatest results in Arsenal's storied history with two blistering free-kicks in the second half of the quarter-final first leg at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday. Mikel Merino scored the third goal for Arteta's side as they moved within touching distance of a first Champions League semi-final appearance since 2009. It was an incredible moment for England midfielder Rice, who had never scored a free-kick in his career – a period spanning 338 previous matches – before the first of his thunderbolts flashed past Real keeper Thibaut Courtois. Arsenal had also failed to find the net from a direct set-piece in almost four years, with their last coming via Martin Odegaard against Burnley in September 2021. Gunners captain Odegaard put his hands on his head in disbelief when Rice completed his set-piece double, while Arteta was equally surprised. ""Declan's been very determined because we have said in the last few months that we have not scored a direct free-kick in three-and-half years,"" the Arsenal manager said. ""So, to score two goals in 12 minutes of that magnitude and of that quality from the same player, a player that has never scored a free-kick before in his career, what are the odds? ""If there's a player who can do it, how clean he strikes it it's Declan. But you have to execute it at the highest level. And against one of the best keepers in the world as well. It's amazing."" It was a cathartic result for Arsenal, who have endured a rocky season marred by their failure to keep pace with Liverpool in the Premier League title race.

Trump's punishing tariffs have shaken a global trading order that has persisted for decades, raised fears of recession and driven worldwide stocks sharply downward. The S&P 500 has shed nearly US$6 trillion in value since Trump unveiled the tariffs a week ago, the deepest four-day loss since the benchmark's creation in the 1950s. The index is now nearing a bear market, defined as 20 percent below its most recent high. The White House has made clear that country-specific tariffs of up to 50 percent would take effect at 0401 GMT as planned. Those tariffs will be especially steep for China, as Trump has ratcheted up duties on its imports to 104 percent in response to counter-tariffs Beijing announced last week. China has refused to bow to what it called blackmail and has vowed to fight to the end. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a news briefing on Tuesday that President Trump believed China wanted to make a deal with the United States concerning additional tariffs. ""The Chinese want to make a deal. They just don't know how to do it,"" Leavitt said. ""He believes China has to make a deal with the United States."" If China reaches out, she added, Trump would be ""incredibly gracious, but he's going to do what's best for the American people.""

""President Trump caused this trade crisis - and Canada is responding with purpose and with force,"" Carney said on X.

RTHK,international,At least 98 dead in Dominican Republic roof collapse,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799520-20250409.htm,"Rescuers raced to find survivors on Tuesday among the rubble of a Dominican Republic nightclub where at least 98 people, including a Major League Baseball star, were killed when the roof collapsed. Renowned Dominican merengue singer Rubby Perez, who was on stage at the popular Jet Set nightclub when the roof caved in shortly after midnight, was one of those caught up in the calamity. Emergency workers said the 69-year-old was among dozens of people trapped in the rubble, some of whom were heard crying for help. Several Dominican media outlets later reported that Perez had been found dead but Juan Manuel Mendez, director of the Emergency Operations Centre, said forensics experts had ""not confirmed that they found the body."" Over 370 rescue personnel combed mounds of fallen bricks, steel bars and tin sheets for survivors. Among the dead was 51-year-old retired MLB pitcher Octavio Dotel, who won a World Series in 2011 with the St Louis Cardinals. He was rescued alive but died of his injuries while being taken to hospital, local media reported. Local media said there were between 500 and 1,000 people in the club when disaster struck shortly at 12:44 am local time. The club has capacity for 700 people seated and about 1,000 people standing. Dozens of ambulances ferried the injured to hospital, as scores of people gathered outside the venue desperately seeking news of their loved ones. Perez was on stage when there was a blackout and the roof came crashing down, according to eyewitness reports. Also among the dead was the governor of the Monte Cristi municipality, Nelsy Cruz, according to President Luis Abinader. The death toll started at 15 and kept rising throughout the day. By evening it had reached 66. President Abinader visited the scene and declared three days of national mourning.

RTHK,sport,Grand National winning jockey Mullins suspended,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799506-20250409.htm,"Patrick Mullins has been given an eight-day suspension after he was found to have breached whip rules when riding Nick Rockett to Grand National glory on Saturday. The Irish amateur rider steered the eight-year-old to victory in the celebrated steeplechase at the Aintree course in Liverpool to complete a notable family double, given 33-1 shot Nick Rockett is trained by his father, Willie Mullins. After the race, Willie Mullins, who achieved the impressive feat of saddling the first three home in the world's most famous jumps race, in addition to being the father of the winning rider, said: ""This is the best day ever, this will never be topped."" Disciplinary officials, however, found Mullins had used his whip one above the permitted level of seven from the final fence. As the Grand National is deemed to be a Class One race under British rules, the usual penalty of four days for such an offence was doubled. The 35-year-old Mullins was, therefore, suspended for eight days in April and May. But the result of the Grand National remained unaltered, however, as is often the case with whip offences in British horseracing. This is a situation critics believe encourages jockeys to break the rules, particularly in showpiece races such as the Grand National, rather than face the possible anger of owners, trainers and punters who might otherwise claim their horse has not been 'ridden out' fully in a finish.

The show marks the British pop band’s return to the SAR after a 16-year hiatus, and the first concert held at the new stadium. Zoe, a longtime Coldplay fan, said she's attending the band’s concert for the first time. “Because it might be the last concert they had in their career, so we're expecting just a very good concert tonight,” she said. Another fan, Judy, got the standing ticket that puts her right next to the stage. “I hope there will be fireworks tonight,” she said. “We already know the routine playlist, but I still want to hear if somebody's gonna order a song. My favourite song is ‘Every Teardrop is a Waterfall.’” She was upset about missing Coldplay’s previous world tour and said this time is a dream come true. “Actually, I used to study in London, but I think it's 2018, 2019, that’s the time they stopped the world tour. So it's such a shame that I didn't get a chance to see the tour. This time is like my dream comes true,” she said. Organisers allowed people to bring empty reusable plastic or silicone bottles that can hold up to 600 millilitres of liquid into the stadium. There were restrictions to bag size while a list of items, including professional cameras and handheld signs, are prohibited. Most fans whom RTHK spoke to, including Bertha, found the rules reasonable. “I'm aware of this and I think it's quite normal to have such restrictions. Because when I was in Taiwan and New Zealand, they didn't allow people to bring water bottles inside as well,” she said. Once the concert got underway, the atmosphere was electric. It started with the band's vocalist, Chris Martin, greeting fans in Cantonese. He said Coldplay were delighted to be in Hong Kong. Fans reached another frenzy when local singer Marf, from the girl group Collar, was invited as a guest to perform with the band. The band also handed out LED wristbands that lit up in different colours for each song. Police, meanwhile, said five people were arrested on suspicion of re-selling tickets at inflated prices. Coldplay will put on three more sold-out shows at Kai Tak Stadium on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. _____________________________ Last updated: 2025-04-08 HKT 22:51","Tue, 08 Apr 2025 19:58:47 +0800","There was fanfare at the Kai Tak Stadium at Tuesday evening as Coldplay kicked off the first of four concerts in Hong Kong on its current world tour.

RTHK,local,HK to target creative industry in strategic push,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799460-20250408.htm,"Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Tuesday the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, OASES, will seek to attract cultural enterprises in the future in a way that combines innovation and technology with artistry. He made the comments at a signing ceremony between the office and 16 companies, including Ant Digital Technologies and China Mobile Innovation Research Institute. Chan said the creative and cultural industries hold huge power and their development is unstoppable. “This sector, enriching lives, sparking joy and preaching cultures, is among the fastest growing in the world,” he said. ""How artistic toys and animation have captivated audiences globally is simply amazing. “Through Hong Kong's platform, creative pioneers can indeed extend their reach across continents.” Chan also said more than 80 strategic enterprises have set up in Hong Kong in the past two years, and will bring nearly HK$50 billion worth of investment and create more than 20,000 jobs. Car company Li Auto is among the companies securing a partnership agreement with OASES. Its senior vice president, Li Guanhua, said the company is looking to invest around HK$20 billion in the city. “We chose to come to Hong Kong to develop a core research centre this year because we value Hong Kong’s position in the whole economic, financial and fintech aspect,” she said. ""Our investment in Hong Kong will be long term."" Li said the Hong Kong office will serve as an offshore clearing centre, as well as a research centre for AI facilities. When asked whether US tariffs would affect company sales, Li said the firm only started developing its overseas market this year but the United States would not be its target. Another company, Enlight Medical, said Hong Kong provides a stable environment given the current chaos created by US tariffs. “The Hong Kong government said it will not follow Beijing’s decision to impose retaliatory tariffs on the US,” said co-founder Rocky Bian of the health technology company. ""This helps us stabilise our global supply chain. “Hong Kong is a free port. Apart from re-export trades, the city also provides stability in importing machine components and raw materials from the US.” Bian said the company will hire around 900 workers in a few years time, spanning from researchers to quality assurance talent. The cost of operating in Hong Kong, he added, does not differ by much from mainland cities. Web 3 auditing company CertiK said it hopes to safeguard technology development in Hong Kong. “Hong Kong is a hub of the financial supply chain and market, and the government is also promoting and encouraging business development in this area,” said its chief security officer Li Kang.

RTHK,finance,HK stocks ends with slight rebound,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799430-20250408.htm,"Asian and European markets battled on Tuesday to recover from the previous day's tariff-fuelled collapse, though Donald Trump's warning of more measures against China and Beijing's vow to ""fight to the end"" raised concerns of a spiralling trade war. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index ended 299.38 points, or 1.51 percent, higher at 20,127.68, but that was well short of recouping Monday's loss of more than 13 percent, the biggest one-day retreat since 1997. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed 2.31 percent to end at 7,430.62 while the Hang Seng Tech Index jumped 3.79 percent to end at 4,568.38. The Hang Seng Index's gains came a day after equities across the world have been hammered since the US president unveiled sweeping levies against friend and foe, upending trading norms, sparking talk of a global recession and wiping trillions of company valuations. Investors fought to claw back some of those losses as they try to assess the possibility that Washington could temper some of the tariffs. Tokyo traded up more than six percent – recovering much of Monday's drop – after Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba held talks with Trump. However, the US leader's threat to hit China with an extra 50 percent tariffs – in response to its 34 percent retaliation in kind – ramped up the chances of a catastrophic stand-off between the two economic superpowers. While uncertainty rules, investors in most markets took the opportunity to pick up some beaten-down stocks. In Tokyo, Nippon Steel closely matched the Nikkei's rebound after Trump launched a review of its proposed takeover of US Steel that was blocked by his predecessor Joe Biden. Shanghai advanced 1.6 percent after China's central bank promised to back major state-backed fund Central Huijin Investment in a bid to maintain ""the smooth operation of the capital market"". Sydney and Mumbai added more than two percent, while Manila gained three percent. Seoul and Wellington also edged up.

RTHK,local,Beijing prepared for US tariff retaliation: Regina Ip,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799392-20250408.htm,"The central government is well prepared and has a broad arsenal to respond to any further tariff escalation by US President Donald Trump, according to Executive Council convenor Regina Ip. She was speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme on Tuesday on Washington's recent tariff barrage launched across the world, including an additional 34 percent tariff on Chinese imports. In response, Beijing hit back with tariffs of 34 percent on all goods from the United States and added 11 US firms to its unreliable entity list. Ip, who's also the New People's Party chairwoman, said Trump is effectively ceding the role of champion of free trade and rule-based multilateral system to China. ""In the long term, China will be the winner, in terms of trade, technology and moral high ground,"" she said. Ip stressed that if Trump does decide to retaliate further, it will only continue to plummet global markets, and that the tariff war will likely continue unless Trump's tycoon backers reign him in or Republicans get burned in the midterm elections next year. As for the likelihood of a global recession, Ip said it's likely. ""The SAR government should work out a panoply of policy options to buoy the local economy pending a global recession,"" she said. When asked about the SAR not setting any countermeasures to the US tariffs, Ip said Hong Kong will continue to be a free port, noting that the city is bound by the Basic Law, as well as its tariff commitments to the World Trade Organization. Weighing in on the same issue, Andrew Leung, China strategist and former senior Hong Kong government official, said the US was upending the very trade institutes it helped create after World War II. He said the current Trump policies are a continuation of what he had started during his previous term in office, and therefore ""China had been preparing for this for a long, long time."" ""Immediately, after Trump 1.0 President Xi was quite prescient -- shortly after Trump won the White House for the first time, he already ordered China to go full steam ahead towards self-sufficiency and self-reliance -- particularly on high technology,"" he said. Leung also said Chinese products will remain competitive globally, like BYD electric cars, because of the superior technology and price, despite the tariff headwinds.","Tue, 08 Apr 2025 12:20:42 +0800","The central government is well prepared and has a broad arsenal to respond to any further tariff escalation by US President Donald Trump, according to Executive Council convenor Regina Ip.

The prediction came a day after a global stock market rout amid concern over the ongoing trade war as seen in tit-for-tat tariff levies between the world's two largest economies. Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Terence Chong, executive director of Chinese University's Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, said that if the US stocks continue to slump, the Fed's top priority is to save the economy. ""I believe the chance of the Fed cutting rates due to the slump in US stocks and global stock market is high,"" he said. ""Because if US stocks continue to drop, it has to save the economy first. ""Inflation is not its top concern."" US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose an additional 50 percent tariffs on Chinese goods from Wednesday if Beijing does not retract its 34 percent counter-tariffs to the American levies imposed last week. Chong said this shows that Trump was scared of China tariffs. The economist pointed out that as soybean is one of China's top US imports, soybean farmers would be hit the hardest under the potential additional levy. He also said if the trade war escalates, it might give rise to smuggling and panic buying in the United States when some goods are not imported to Washington. Separately, Chong expects Hong Kong stocks to remain volatile in the short run and suggests investors not enter the market for now.","Tue, 08 Apr 2025 11:57:41 +0800","An economist said on Tuesday he expects the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates sooner than expected in a bid to rescue the American economy.

RTHK,international,Kennedy gets teeth into ending US fluoridation,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799385-20250408.htm,"US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr said he plans to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation in communities nationwide. Kennedy said on Monday he’s assembling a task force of health experts to study the issue and make new recommendations. Also on Monday, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced it is reviewing “new scientific information"" on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water. The EPA sets the maximum level allowed in public water systems. Kennedy was speaking after a news conference with EPA administrator Lee Zeldin in Salt Lake City. Kennedy cannot order communities to stop fluoridation, but he can direct the CDC to stop recommending it and work with the EPA to change the allowed amount. Utah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities. Republican governor Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their drinking water. Water systems across the state must stop fluoridation by May 7. Opponents say the law will hurt residents who can’t afford regular dentist visits and may rely on public drinking water containing fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care. Kennedy oversees the CDC, whose recommendations are widely followed but not mandatory. State and local governments decide whether to add fluoride to water and, if so, how much – as long as it doesn’t exceed a maximum set by the EPA, which is currently four milligrams per liter. Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and in 1962 they set guidelines for how much should be added to water. Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a “dangerous neurotoxin” and said it has been associated with arthritis, bone breaks and thyroid disease. Some studies have suggested such links might exist, usually at higher-than-recommended fluoride levels, though some reviewers have questioned the quality of available evidence and said no definitive conclusions can be drawn.

RTHK,international,World temps near record highs in March: scientists,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799381-20250408.htm,"Global temperatures hovered at historic highs in March, Europe's climate monitor said on Tuesday, prolonging an extraordinary heat streak that has tested scientific expectations. In Europe, it was the hottest March ever recorded by a significant margin, said the Copernicus Climate Change Service, driving rainfall extremes across a continent warming faster than any other. The world, meanwhile, saw the second-hottest March in the Copernicus dataset, sustaining a near-unbroken spell of record or near-record-breaking temperatures that has persisted since July 2023. Since then, virtually every month has been at least 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than it was before the industrial revolution when humanity began burning massive amounts of coal, oil and gas. March was 1.6C above pre-industrial times, prolonging an anomaly so extreme that scientists are still trying to fully explain it. ""That we're still at 1.6C above pre-industrial is indeed remarkable,"" said Friederike Otto of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial College London. Scientists warn that every fraction of a degree of global warming increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall and droughts. Climate change is not just about rising temperatures but the knock-on effect of all that extra heat being trapped in the atmosphere and seas by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. Warmer seas mean higher evaporation and greater moisture in the atmosphere, causing heavier deluges and feeding energy into cyclones, but also affecting global rainfall patterns. March in Europe was 0.26C above the previous hottest record for the month set in 2014, Copernicus said. It was also ""a month with contrasting rainfall extremes"" across the continent, said Samantha Burgess of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which runs the Copernicus climate monitor. Some parts of Europe experienced their ""driest March on record and others their wettest"" for about half a century, Burgess said. Elsewhere in March, scientists said that climate change intensified an extreme heatwave across Central Asia and fuelled conditions for extreme rainfall which killed 16 people in Argentina. The spectacular surge in global heat pushed 2023 and then 2024 to become the hottest years on record. Last year was also the first full calendar year to exceed 1.5C: the safer warming limit agreed by most nations under the Paris climate accord. This represented a temporary, not permanent breach, of this longer-term target, but scientists have warned that the goal of keeping temperatures below that threshold is slipping further out of reach. Scientists had expected that the extraordinary heat spell would subside after a warming El Nino event peaked in early 2024, and conditions gradually shifted to a cooling La Nina phase. But global temperatures have remained stubbornly high, sparking debate among scientists about what other factors could be driving warming to the top end of expectations. Scientists say the current period is likely the warmest the Earth has been for the last 125,000 years.

South Korea has been effectively leaderless since December, when former president Yoon attempted to subvert civilian rule but was quickly impeached by lawmakers and suspended from office. A court last week upheld his impeachment, stripping him of the top job, and triggering fresh elections, which must be held within 60 days. The government had held ""discussions with the National Election Commission and other related agencies"", Acting President and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said on Tuesday. It also took into account ""the need to ensure smooth election operations and allow sufficient time for political parties to prepare,"" he said. As a result they have decided ""to set June 3 as the date for South Korea's 21st presidential election,"" he said, adding that the day would be designated as a temporary public holiday to facilitate voting. Han called upon ministries and the National Election Commission to ""make thorough preparations to ensure an election that is fairer and more transparent than ever, and one that can earn the trust of the people."" Unlike a regular poll, where a president-elect has a two-month transition period, the winner of the June 3 election will be inaugurated the following day. Han resumed acting as president recently after the Constitutional Court threw out his own impeachment. Presidential elections are typically held on Wednesdays, but no specific weekday is required for snap polls triggered by a vacancy. The official campaign period will run from May 12 until June 2. Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung is the frontrunner in any polls, with a 34 percent support rating according to the latest Gallup poll. His party already controls the National Assembly. He narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election but staged a political comeback as leader of the main opposition, despite a career shadowed by legal troubles, including ongoing trials. In distant second place is Labour Minister Kim Moon-soo. Polling around nine percent, he leads a pack of challengers from Yoon's People Power Party, which also includes former party chief Han Dong-hoon.

In comments on X, the agency did not name these countries. ""If implemented, this could amount to a death sentence for millions of people facing extreme hunger and starvation,"" it said.

RTHK,international,Supreme Court backs Trump over Alien Enemies Act,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799334-20250408.htm,"The US Supreme Court handed Donald Trump a victory on Monday by letting him use a 1798 law that historically has been employed only in wartime to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members as part of the Republican president's hardline approach to immigration. The court granted the administration's request to lift Washington-based US Judge James Boasberg's March 15 order that had temporarily blocked the summary deportations under Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act while litigation in the case continues. Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act on March 15 to swiftly deport the alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang, attempting to speed up removals with a law best known for its use to intern Japanese, Italian and German immigrants during World War Two. In a legal challenge handled by the American Civil Liberties Union, a group of Venezuelan men in the custody of US immigration authorities on the same day sued on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, seeking to block the deportations. They argued, among other things, that Trump's order exceeded his powers because the Alien Enemies Act authorises removals only when war has been declared or the United States has been invaded. The Alien Enemies Act authorises the president to deport, detain or place restrictions on individuals whose primary allegiance is to a foreign power and who might pose a national security risk in wartime. Boasberg, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, temporarily blocked the deportations. But Trump's administration allowed two planes already in the air to continue to El Salvador where American officials handed 238 Venezuelan men over to Salvadoran authorities to be placed in the Central American country's ""Terrorism Confinement Center."" The judge also has scrutinized whether the Trump administration violated his order by failing to return the deportation flights after his order was issued. Justice Department lawyers said the flights had left US airspace by the time Boasberg issued a written order and thus were not required to return. They dismissed the weight of Boasberg's spoken order during a hearing two hours earlier calling for any planes carrying deportees to be turned around. Trump's administration has argued that Boasberg's temporary ban encroached on presidential authority to make national security decisions. On March 18, Trump called for Boasberg's impeachment by Congress - a process that could remove him from the bench - drawing a rebuke from the US Chief Justice John Roberts. Trump on social media called Boasberg, who was confirmed by the US Senate in 2011 in a bipartisan 96-0 vote, a ""Radical Left Lunatic"" and a ""troublemaker and agitator."" The DC Circuit upheld Boasberg's order after holding a contentious hearing that involved heated language. Judge Patricia Millett told Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign that ""Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here."" Ensign responded, ""We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy."" Family members of many of the deported Venezuelan migrants deny the alleged gang ties. Lawyers for one of the deportees, a Venezuelan professional soccer player and youth coach, said US officials had wrongly labelled him a gang member based on a tattoo of a crown meant to honour his favourite team, Real Madrid. (Reuters)","Tue, 08 Apr 2025 07:53:43 +0800","The US Supreme Court handed Donald Trump a victory on Monday by letting him use a 1798 law that historically has been employed only in wartime to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members as part of the Republican president's hardline approach to immigration. The court granted the administration's request to lift Washington-based US Judge James Boasberg's March 15 order that had temporarily blocked the summary deportations under Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act while litigation in the case continues. Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act on March 15 to swiftly deport the alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang, attempting to speed up removals with a law best known for its use to intern Japanese, Italian and German immigrants during World War Two.

""If China does not withdraw its 34 percent increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50 percent, effective April 9th,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post.

It is not immediately clear how Trump's new threat factors into this calculation. China's response included export controls on rare earth elements, and Beijing plans for its own 34 percent tariff on US goods, stacking atop existing Chinese levies set to begin April 10. Earlier, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said the new tariffs harmed the stability of global production and supply chains and seriously impacted the world’s economic recovery. “Pressure and threats are not the way to deal with China. China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” Lin told reporters.

Hong Kong's stock market had outperformed the United States since Trump took office, but Monday's rout wiped out HSI gains from the first quarter. Investors have taken a wait-and-see approach for weeks as Trump finalised his trade policies, Chik said, adding that the mood was not yet one of ""despair"". Hong Kong tops the world in retail investor participation, with one 2023 survey showing that 48 percent of the respondents held or traded stocks in the preceding year. A 35-year-old man, Tsang, said his long-term investments lost around US$12,900 on Monday, but he would not consider selling yet. ""I didn't expect it to get so bad,"" said Tsang, a bank employee. China A-shares may be more resilient, he added. ""In this sort of fight (between China and the United States), it's hard to say who will suffer more."" Lawyer Ray Chan, 30, was among those left unscathed on Monday, as he sold all his Hong Kong and US shareholdings two weeks ago, netting gains in the seven figures. ""We're clearly entering a bear market but I'm prepared,"" Chan said. ""When [Trump] said there would be tariffs on April 2, I could guess where things were headed."" It will take ""at least a year"" before he returns to the market, Chan said. (AFP)",2025-04-07 18:05:08

Trading floors were overcome by a wave of selling as investors fled to the hills, with Hong Kong's loss of 13 percent its worst in nearly three decades, while Taipei dived 9.7 percent, Tokyo almost eight percent and Frankfurt 10 percent in early trading. The benchmark Hang Seng Index lost 3,021.51 points to end 13.22 percent down at 19,828.30.

On Sunday, vice commerce minister Ling Ji told representatives of US firms its tariffs ""firmly protect the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises, including American companies"".

""A lot of people are asking me, or are telling me, that I have the chance to become number one if Jannik is not playing,"" Alcaraz said ahead of the Monte Carlo Masters. ""So probably that pressure has killed me in some way."" The 21-year-old Spaniard added that staying at world number three has not come as a shock to him. ""I'm not surprised because the people always say that we have to win the tournaments or the top people have to be there all the time playing finals or winning tournaments,"" he said. Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz has endured a tough start to 2025, with his only title coming on the hard courts of Rotterdam two months ago. But the 1000 event in Monte Carlo signals the start of the clay-court season – a surface Alcaraz has excelled on. He won the French Open last year, as well as back-to-back Madrid Masters in 2022 and 2023. Sinner has been out of action since accepting a three-month doping ban in February after twice testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year. The 23-year-old Italian is due to return in time for the Rome Open in May. Alcaraz, currently trailing Sinner by 3,610 points in the rankings, said he has been at peace with not usurping the Italian as the world's best player. ""I'm just thinking that I'm not able to become number one... in the clay season, even if Jannik is not playing, I don't have the chance to do it,"" he said. ""I think I'm too far from Jannik. So I'm just here and I realise that I don't have to think about it and just go there and play. ""That's my mindset right now."" After being eliminated on his debut in 2022 and withdrawing from the last two editions, Alcaraz has yet to win a match on the Monte Carlo clay. Given a bye for the first round, he will seek to end that streak when he takes on the winner of round of 64 match between Francisco Cerundolo and Fabio Fognini.

But the 1000 event in Monte Carlo signals the start of the clay-court season – a surface Alcaraz has excelled on. He won the French Open last year, as well as back-to-back Madrid Masters in 2022 and 2023. Sinner has been out of action since accepting a three-month doping ban in February after twice testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year. The 23-year-old Italian is due to return in time for the Rome Open in May. Alcaraz, currently trailing Sinner by 3,610 points in the rankings, said he has been at peace with not usurping the Italian as the world's best player. ""I'm just thinking that I'm not able to become number one... in the clay season, even if Jannik is not playing, I don't have the chance to do it,"" he said. ""I think I'm too far from Jannik. So I'm just here and I realise that I don't have to think about it and just go there and play. ""That's my mindset right now."" After being eliminated on his debut in 2022 and withdrawing from the last two editions, Alcaraz has yet to win a match on the Monte Carlo clay. Given a bye for the first round, he will seek to end that streak when he takes on the winner of round of 64 match between Francisco Cerundolo and Fabio Fognini. (AFP)",2025-04-07 12:48:40

In the run-up to the city's National Security Education Day on April 15, Secretary for Justice Paul Lam told local newspaper Sing Tao Daily that the push to raise public awareness should not be limited to certain days. For example, he said, one should not treat one's spouse well only on Valentine's Day, adding that national security education should similarly be an everyday thing. Lam also warned that national security risks might still exist even though Hong Kong now has a very stable environment. One of six officials recently sanctioned by the United States, Lam said Washington's move might encourage more people to take part in work to safeguard national security. He said the punitive actions would not affect him and that none of the officials placed on Washington's list left their job as a result of the sanctions. While no one would be happy to be sanctioned, Lam said, it did not mean that they had to be agitated and upset over it.","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 12:04:16 +0800","Hong Kong's justice chief has stressed that educating the public on national security is an ongoing effort, calling on people to stay vigilant against possible threats.

But one of the complaints was resolved in an out-of-court settlement late on Sunday, a judicial source said, in line with most earlier litigants. Barring another last-minute settlement, the trial will begin on Monday with the selection of an eight-person jury.

The new feature transforms photos and memes into the soft pastel palette style of Studio Ghibli — the renowned Japanese animation workshop behind “Spirited Away”. AI consultant Raj Shroff told RTHK he believes the effect is good marketing for the animation studio. ""Studio Ghibli's viewership could increase by a factor of two, five or 10. The people that own Studio Ghibli, their employees and their current fans, they should be very happy that they're just getting free advertising,"" he said. While the AI chatbot's usage and app downloads have hit record highs after the viral rollout, it has raised concerns about privacy and copyright. Studio Ghibli's founder Hayao Miyazaki previously expressed strong opposition to AI animation, and Miyazaki's son said in a recent interview that his father's creative work is irreplaceable. Shroff, for his part, thinks companies should follow ethical guidelines when developing features that replicate distinct artistic styles, such as watermarking AI-generated images. Asked about the relationship between AI art and traditional animation, Shroff compares it to lab-grown diamonds versus natural diamonds. ""Because AI animation or AI art is so easy to create, my personal theory is that the value attached to it will be a little bit lower,"" he said. ""When it comes to very hardcore or dedicated fan bases of Studio Ghibli or another style of animation, they may prefer the old-school animation methods.

However, Pep Guardiola's men are just two points above Newcastle, who have two games in hand on City. A point leaves United languishing down in 13th, but they had the better of a game limited in chances as they missed out on a first league double over City since 2019/20. ""We have so many aspects to improve. Everywhere we need to improve in every aspect: build up, transition, decisions in the final third,"" said Amorim. ""Every player can improve, they are here because they showed something at other clubs. They have the quality, but we are still a team that plays on transition, we need to spend more time in final third to have more opportunities."" Never in the Premier League era have neither City or United finished in the top four but that record is under severe threat in the coming months.

After a record four consecutive league titles, City's form has fallen off a cliff to leave them at risk of not making the top four for the first time since 2009/10. United's only chance of Champions League qualification is by winning the Europa League as they are set for their worst ever Premier League finish. The Red Devils have shown flashes of improvement this week but also failed to score in their 1-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest on Tuesday to underline their problem in front of goal. ""We just need to have a bit more of a killer instinct,"" said United captain Bruno Fernandes. ""In the first half we had to many touches when we just needed one. We were patient, very organised but the killer instinct was missing today."" Kevin De Bruyne started just days after announcing this will be his final season at City. But the Belgian's performance was the latest example that he is now a shadow of the figure Guardiola said will be remembered as one of the Premier League's all-time greats. City had the majority of the ball, but United were the more threatening side on the counter-attack in a pedestrian first half. ""We were not good enough to punish them or hurt them a little bit more than what happened,"" said Guardiola. ""We take the point. It would be better to win but still we are there."" Phil Foden had the game's best chance just seconds after half-time but fluffed his lines with only Andre Onana to beat.

A heavyweight showdown between the Western Conference leaders and the third-placed Lakers was effectively settled in the first half, as Los Angeles rattled in 15 three-pointers, a franchise record, to open up a 78-56 lead at the end of the second quarter. The Lakers never looked like surrendering that hefty double-digit cushion as they closed out a comfortable win to silence the Oklahoma City home crowd. The win saw the Lakers edge closer to securing one of the four remaining automatic playoff spots in the West after already-qualified Oklahoma City and Houston. The Lakers poured in 22 three-pointers across the game, with Doncic responsible for five of them. Austin Reaves had four three-pointers in his 20 point haul, while LeBron James added 19 points. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Oklahoma City scoring with 26 points on an off-night for the Thunder, who shot just 43 percent from the field while making only 12-of-37 three-pointers.

""Between them and Cleveland, they're the best teams in the NBA,"" James said. ""They're the number one team in the West so you can't let up no matter what the score is – they're always going to make a push. That's why they are where they are at this part of the season. ""So it's a really good win for us and we can build off it... we're just trying to build our habits right now, going into the final stretch of the year.""

Six teams are battling for four playoff spots in the West, from the third-placed Lakers (48-30) down to the eighth-placed Memphis Grizzlies (46-32). ""It's huge,"" Reaves said. ""The way the standings are, you can go from third to eighth in the snap of a finger. So for us to come in and play such a good team the way we did tonight is big. Hopefully we can build on that momentum."" Elsewhere on Sunday, the Cleveland Cavaliers missed the chance to lock up the No.1 seeding in the Eastern Conference after suffering a 120-113 home defeat to the Sacramento Kings.

A heavyweight showdown between the Western Conference leaders and the third-placed Lakers was effectively settled in the first half, as Los Angeles rattled in 15 three-pointers, a franchise record, to open up a 78-56 lead at the end of the second quarter. The Lakers never looked like surrendering that hefty double-digit cushion as they closed out a comfortable win to silence the Oklahoma City home crowd.

RTHK,international,Seoul to set presidential election for June 3: Yonhap,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799191-20250407.htm,"South Korea's cabinet is expected to finalise a June 3 date for a presidential election following the removal of Yoon Suk Yeol last week for his short-lived martial law declaration, Yonhap news said on Monday. Although not required by law, the cabinet will make the decision at a meeting on Tuesday, as it needs to approve a holiday for the event, Yonhap cited an unidentified government official as saying. RTHK's correspondent in Seoul, Frank Smith, said Lee Jae-myung, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), was considered the frontrunner in a new election, having lost to Yoon in 2022 by a margin of less than one percent. ""He's widely favoured. He's got something like a margin of 34 percent approval to nine percent for the second candidate of the Conservative bloc. So he's looking pretty good. He does have some legal problems, however, that could affect his campaign and possibly even prevent him from running, although he cleared a hurdle in that regard about two weeks ago,"" said Smith. Yoon was removed by the Constitutional Court on grounds of having violated his official duty by issuing the martial law decree on December 3 and mobilising troops to halt parliamentary proceedings. The law requires a new presidential election within 60 days if the incumbent dies or is removed from office. An official of the National Election Commission said the date mentioned in media reports was not final and would not become official until declared by the acting president, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo. Smith said he did not think Yoon's removal would be the end of the current political crisis in South Korea. ""South Korea has some serious political divisions that really bubbled to the surface over the past four months. Those are going to remain here. For Yoon, on the legal front, the impeachment is just one aspect of this. He still has a criminal trial to go. His lawyers prioritised the impeachment trial and kind of set aside the criminal trial as much as possible... So he has some pretty serious charges of insurrection to face, again, looking at a long prison sentence and perhaps even a death penalty, although most people suggest that's quite unlikely.""

RTHK,finance,Hang Seng Index slumps on US tariff sell-off,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799185-20250407.htm,"Financial markets in Hong Kong and across the border dived on Monday as markets around the world crumbled in the face of a widening global trade war and fears it will unleash a deep recession. The Hang Seng index slumped more than 10 percent in morning trade which, if sustained, would make for the benchmark's largest daily fall since the 2008 global financial crisis. Banking stocks collapsed, with Hong Kong-listed shares of HSBC and Standard Chartered tumbling 15 percent. The CSI300 blue-chip index fell more than 5 percent with selling in nearly every sector. The yuan slipped to its lowest since January and bonds rallied sharply. China, which is now facing US tariffs of over 50 percent, responded in kind on Friday by slapping extra levies on US imports. Mainland indexes of solar companies and household appliance makers notched losses around 10 percent. The Hang Seng volatility index shot to its highest since October. Shares of online giants Alibaba and Tencent were down more than 8 percent. ""It's a harsh time when markets go down so dramatically,"" said Andrew Sullivan, founder of Asian Market Sense, who noted that the latest plunge came as investors race to liquidate some of their shares in the face of a cash crunch following a market meltdown, especially for those who trade using margin financing, or borrowing money from brokers to purchase an investment. ""But one should get over the initial panic of wanting to sell, because a lot of the time these markets rebound within days or weeks,"" he said. ""That said, this current situation with tariffs being imposed by Trump, and then retaliatory tariffs by China does indicate that this is a situation that's unlikely to resolve itself anytime soon."" For his part, Alex Wong, director of Alex KY Wong Asset Management, said ""the [market sell-off] was beyond my expectation. ""This is a liquidation sale as people sought to exit [the market]. But the magnitude of the decline was more than expected."" He expects Beijing to offer stimulus measures in the short term to stabilise the market, such as a cut in the reserve requirement ratio for banks or a tax cut as part of a package of stronger fiscal support. Noting that the chance of the global economy to enter a recession this year has increased to at least 60 to 70 percent following the tit-for-tat tariff disputes between the world's two largest economies, Wong said a deal between the two sides is needed but difficult to realise. ""China knows that if it complies with US demands, this will reinforce Trump's ego and he will ask for more later on, that's why China took a hard stance now. It would be very difficult for both sides to reach a deal. ""We probably will be in a bear market for a long time,"" Wong said. Separately, Sullivan noted that the a key event to follow is whether the US Congress representatives from both parties will stop Trump from implementing the reciprocal tariffs – by revoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergency Act that Trump used to impose the tariffs. ""Historically, if you saw the VIX index (a barometer for market uncertainty) is above 32, 33 percent, you'd normally get a policy changed by the government."" ""[But] the VIX index on Friday got above 40 percent, and we've seen no change of Trump turning about or evoking his trade policy. So it's a very difficult position,"" he said. ""But if they [Congress members] feel that their own caucuses and electorate are going to turn against them, they will have to make a choice. ""Do they stick with Trump who is unlikely to have a third term, or do they stick with their electorate, and support them and go against trump? ""That'll be a very interesting thing that we're likely to see in the next couple of weeks.""

Leandro Trossard's opener for the Gunners was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye's penalty to leave Arsenal trailing 11 points behind Liverpool, who travel to Fulham on Sunday. Liverpool need just 11 points from their remaining eight games to secure a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title and first since 2020. With just two wins in their last six league matches, Arsenal have tamely surrendered in the title race and are destined to go another year without their first English crown since 2004. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta had said the best preparation for his side's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Real Madrid would be to win at Goodison Park. But the Spaniard showed he had one eye on the visit of the European champions with his team selection. Bukayo Saka was forced to wait for his first start since December as the England international was left on the bench alongside Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Martinelli, Jurrien Timber and Thomas Partey. ""This is a very tough place to come, a team who is very physical and direct. If you don't deal with it, it's hard to get momentum. The start of the second half was very poor,"" Arteta said. Arsenal's weakened line-up struck first in the 34th minute when Raheem Sterling picked out Trossard and his low shot took Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford by surprise as it squirmed into the net. Everton were unable to stop Liverpool's march to the title in midweek when they lost 1-0 in the Merseyside derby at Anfield. David Moyes' men did their arch rivals another favour as they drew level in the 49th minute. Myles Lewis-Skelly fouled Jack Harrison and Ndiaye stroked home from the penalty spot four minutes into the second period to put Liverpool within touching distance of the title. At Villa Park, Unai Emery's side climbed into sixth as early goals from Morgan Rogers and Donyell Malen saw off third-placed Forest, who got one back through Jota Silva. Villa's seventh consecutive victory in all competitions was the ideal preparation for Wednesday's trip to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League quarter-final first leg. A top-five Premier League finish will almost certainly be enough for Villa to qualify for next season's Champions League. Villa sit below fifth-placed Manchester City on goal difference and within one point of Chelsea in fourth. Wolves effectively sealed their survival and left Ipswich on the brink of relegation with a 2-1 win at Portman Road. Vitor Pereira's side trailed to Liam Delap's 16th-minute goal as the striker swept in Dara O'Shea's knockdown. But Pablo Sarabia drilled into the bottom corner to haul Wolves level in the 72nd minute, before Jorgen Strand Larsen prodded home on 84 minutes for his fourth goal in his last three games. Fourth-bottom Wolves are 12 points clear of third-bottom Ipswich with just seven games left, leaving Kieran McKenna's side almost certain to return to the Championship after just one season. Wolves' victory also means bottom of the table Southampton will be relegated if they lose at Tottenham on Sunday. Crystal Palace beat Brighton 2-1 despite finishing with nine men in a bruising battle featuring three red cards at Selhurst Park. FA Cup semi-finalists Palace went ahead thanks to Jean-Philippe Mateta's third minute curler, before Danny Welbeck's close-range effort in the 31st minute dragged Brighton level. Daniel Munoz blasted Palace's winner in the 55th minute, but the Eagles had to dig deep for the win.

""The market has spoken,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said in a post on Facebook on Saturday. He also posted a picture capturing Friday's falls on US stock markets.

RTHK,local,Water tariff review aims to make users pay: director,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799041-20250405.htm,"The Director of Water Supplies said on Saturday that while the department is still reviewing water charges, its objective is to achieve the principle of user pays. Roger Wong revealed on a television programme that the public's average daily water consumption has dropped by 12 percent compared to during the pandemic. The department has been reviewing water charges, which have been kept at the same level for almost three decades, since last year, and Wong said the authorities also have to take into account people's livelihoods, as well as the current economic situation.

About one to two percent of them are considered very old, the director said, and they are located near residential areas or busier roads.

The March 28 quake flattened buildings and destroyed infrastructure across the country, resulting in 3,354 deaths and 4,508 people injured, with 220 others missing, according to new figures published by state media. More than one week after the disaster, many people in the country are still without shelter, either forced to sleep outdoors because their homes were destroyed or wary of further collapses. A United Nations estimate suggests that more than three million people may have been affected by the 7.7-magnitude quake, compounding previous challenges caused by four years of civil war. The UN's top aid official on Saturday met with victims in the central Myanmar city of Mandalay – situated close to the epicentre and now grappling with severe damage across the city. ""The destruction is staggering,"" Tom Fletcher wrote in a post on X. ""The world must rally behind the people of Myanmar."" The new toll was announced after the country's military junta chief Min Aung Hlaing returned from a rare foreign trip to a regional summit in Bangkok on Friday, where he met with leaders including the prime ministers of Thailand and India. The general's attendance at the summit courted controversy, with protesters at the venue displaying a banner calling him a ""murderer"" and anti-junta groups condemning his inclusion. His armed forces have ruled Myanmar since a 2021 coup, when they wrested power from the civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking a multi-sided conflict that has yet to be resolved. The junta has reportedly conducted dozens of attacks since the earthquake, including at least 16 since a temporary truce was announced on Wednesday, the UN said on Friday. Years of fighting have left Myanmar's economy and infrastructure in tatters, significantly hampering international efforts to provide relief since the quake. China, Russia and India were among the first countries to provide support, sending rescue teams to Myanmar to help locate survivors. The United States has traditionally been at the forefront of international disaster relief, but President Donald Trump has dismantled the country's humanitarian aid agency. Washington said on Friday it was adding US$7 million on top of an earlier US$2 million in assistance to Myanmar.

On Friday, Beijing announced it would impose a 34 percent tariff on all US imports starting on April 10. The move was in response to US President Donald Trump's announcement on April 2 of a fresh round of tariffs targeting countries worldwide. They included a 34 percent tariff on Chinese goods in addition to the previous 20 percent levy. Washington also made no distinction between goods coming from the SAR and the mainland. In response, Lau said - apart from imposing countermeasures on Washington should Beijing request such a move - Hong Kong could also consider placing levies on US goods. Meanwhile, Terence Chong, executive director of Chinese University's Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, believes Beijing's latest round of tariffs will cause US stocks to fall further. He said a recession would likely occur in the US in the next few quarters due to inflationary concerns and the reduction in GDP caused by a decline in consumption. Chong also said the US might impose additional tariffs in response to Beijing's move, further reducing trade between the two countries.","Sat, 05 Apr 2025 11:12:23 +0800","A senior member of a leading national think tank says China's retaliatory tariffs on the US aim to cause pain.

RTHK,sport,Van der Poel and Pogacar face off in Tour of Flanders,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799008-20250405.htm,"Come rain or shine 750,000 fans are expected to turn out on Sunday for cycling's most revered one-day race, the Tour of Flanders, for a Tadej Pogacar and Mathieu van der Poel showdown. The all-rounder Pogacar won the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and world championships in 2024, while Van der Poel, who is 10 kilos heavier than the Slovenian, is the most powerful one-day racer, and has multiple mountain bike and cyclocross titles. Pogacar has also confirmed he will ride the Paris-Roubaix with its 54km of cobbles and no hills in next Sunday's big one. Van der Poel won both last season. Each has seven wins in the Monuments and last time the two went head-to-head Van der Poel came out on top at Milan - San Remo in March. ""Mathieu is one of the best sprinters in the peloton,"" said the effervescent Pogacar. ""Flanders is a very different race. But if there's a sprint, I'll do my best."" While Pogacar won here in 2023, Van der Poel is one of seven men to have won it three times and could become the first to win a fourth. In this epic 270km struggle through lush Flemish plains, Van der Poel's weight might be an advantage for the distance and the 18 cobbled sections. For the slighter Pogacar, there are 17 short, punchy hills where he can exercise his devastating kick. Belgian hopes would normally rest on Wout van Aert. He has struggled to find any form since a win at the Vuelta last year but Pogacar is not ruling him out. ""Wout seems pretty good to me. He's on the pace,"" Pogacar said. ""He'll be in there on Sunday."" Denmark's Mads Pedersen and Filippo Ganna of Ineos are two other on-form riders to watch out for. First staged in 1913 the Tour of Flanders was designed to reflect the stoicism of the Flemish. The winner is often a tough, tactically-minded rider ready to give every last drop for victory. Van der Poel won the 2020, 2022 and 2024 Flanders and has twice been runner-up, but after winning the Milan - San Remo in March he picked out Pogacar as favourite for this one. ""There are many more hills here for him to attack on. It'll be hard, but then it always is,"" said the 30-year-old Dutch phenomenon. After the 114km mark, there is a cobbled hill every 8km or so, constantly whittling down the field which will start with 25 teams of seven. Each hillside in the latter part of the race is turned into a giant makeshift party pub, with beer tents and food caravans before an after-party that goes on late into the night. Pogacar said of his 2023 win he could retire happy after soloing home thanks to a series of devastating attacks. He opted not to defend his title in 2024 to target an elusive Giro-Tour double last achieved by the late Marco Pantini in 1998. There are five ultra-long one-day bike races known as the Monuments, and the Tour of Flanders is considered the greatest because of the constant steep, narrow climbs coupled with crowds that even a 100 years ago began to tip over half a million. The other four Monuments are Milan-San Remo, which calls for patience, the mudfest of Paris-Roubaix with its perilous rough-hewn cobbles, Liege-Bastogne-Liege through the winding forested lanes of the Ardennes, and the Tour of Lombardy which is a climbers' classic. Shuttle buses and extra trains have been laid on throughout Flanders for what is regarded by many as an unofficial world championship. (AFP)","Sat, 05 Apr 2025 09:53:19 +0800","Come rain or shine 750,000 fans are expected to turn out on Sunday for cycling's most revered one-day race, the Tour of Flanders, for a Tadej Pogacar and Mathieu van der Poel showdown. The all-rounder Pogacar won the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and world championships in 2024, while Van der Poel, who is 10 kilos heavier than the Slovenian, is the most powerful one-day racer, and has multiple mountain bike and cyclocross titles. Pogacar has also confirmed he will ride the Paris-Roubaix with its 54km of cobbles and no hills in next Sunday's big one. Van der Poel won both last season. Each has seven wins in the Monuments and last time the two went head-to-head Van der Poel came out on top at Milan - San Remo in March. ""Mathieu is one of the best sprinters in the peloton,"" said the effervescent Pogacar. ""Flanders is a very different race. But if there's a sprint, I'll do my best."" While Pogacar won here in 2023, Van der Poel is one of seven men to have won it three times and could become the first to win a fourth. In this epic 270km struggle through lush Flemish plains, Van der Poel's weight might be an advantage for the distance and the 18 cobbled sections.

RTHK,international,"Tariffs to raise inflation, cool growth: Fed Chair",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798991-20250405.htm,"US President Donald Trump's tariffs risk higher unemployment and will likely cause inflation to rise and growth to slow, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday. Trump's dramatic trade measures announced earlier this week have tightened scrutiny of Powell and how the Fed will react to free falling financial markets and concerns that a prolonged trade war would ramp up consumer prices and joblessness rates. ""The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,"" Powell told an event in Virginia., adding that it was ""too soon"" to consider changes to US monetary policy. Powell spoke just minutes after Trump posted on social media, urging him to cut interest rates immediately and accusing him of playing politics in his role running the independent US central bank. The larger-than-expected tariffs unveiled on Wednesday stack on top of earlier country-specific levies, meaning that China, for example, will now face a new levy totalling 54 percent. Other top trading partners will also see higher rates, with the European Union now facing a 20 percent tariff from April 9, and India looking at a 26 percent levy. The Trump administration has also targeted specific sectors of the economy, recently slapping a 25 percent tariff on automobiles not made in the United States. Powell said Friday that he expected the current uncertainty to decline in the coming months. Powell's comments suggest the Fed is in no rush to cut its benchmark lending rate from its current elevated level of between 4.25 and 4.50 percent, as it continues its struggle to bring inflation down to its long-term two percent target. In recent months, the Fed's progress in bringing inflation down to target has stalled, while growth has remained solid and the unemployment rate has hugged close to historic lows. Faced with this data, the Fed voted last month to extend its pause in rate cuts and signalled that it wanted to see how the new administration's policies would feed through to the economy before taking any action. Fed policymakers - now including Powell - have warned that tariffs could cause prices to rise, with the extent of the price increase likely determined by the rollout of the levies and how consumers and businesses respond. Ahead of Powell's speech on Friday, Donald Trump took to his Truth Social account to insist that his tariff policy would not change despite the market reaction and called on Powell to act. ""CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!"" wrote Trump, who first nominated Powell to run the Fed, before turning against him during his first term. Speaking Friday, Powell insisted he had no plans to step down as Fed chair before his term ends next year. ""I fully intend to serve all of my term,"" he said during the Virginia event.

RTHK,international,Trump extends TikTok deadline to find buyer,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798987-20250405.htm,"US President Donald Trump on Friday extended the deadline for TikTok to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a ban in the United States, allowing 75 more days to find a solution. ""My administration has been working very hard on a deal to save TikTok, and we have made tremendous progress,"" Trump said on Truth Social, just hours before the deadline was to expire. ""A transaction requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days."" The hugely popular video-sharing app, which has well over 170 million American users, is under threat from a US law that passed overwhelmingly last year and orders TikTok to split from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, or get shut down in the United States. Trump has insisted his administration is near a deal to find a buyer for TikTok and keep it from shutting down that would involve multiple investors but has given few details. Motivated by national security fears and belief in Washington that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese government, the ban took effect on January 19, one day before Trump's inauguration. In the hours before that deadline, TikTok was temporarily shut down in the United States and disappeared from app stores, to the dismay of millions of users. But the Republican president quickly announced an initial 75-day delay, and TikTok subsequently restored service to users, returning to the Apple and Google app stores in February. The new 75-day delay pushes the deadline to June 19. The president added on Friday that he would ""continue working in good faith with China."" The president suggested TikTok could even be part of a broader deal with China to ease the stinging tariffs he imposed on Beijing as part of a worldwide blitz of levies. According to reports, the solution in the works would see existing US investors in ByteDance roll over their stakes into a new independent global TikTok company. Additional US investors, including Oracle and Blackstone, the private equity firm, would be brought on to reduce ByteDance's share. ABC News reported on Friday that Walmart was also in the mix. Uncertainty remains, particularly over what would happen to TikTok's valuable algorithm. ""TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand – it's simply not as powerful,"" said Forrester Principal Analyst Kelsey Chickering. Amazon has also reportedly made a last-minute bid to buy TikTok. Other proposals include an initiative called ""The People's Bid for TikTok"", launched by real estate and sports tycoon Frank McCourt's Project Liberty initiative. Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity recently expressed interest in buying TikTok, as did a joint venture involving YouTube mega-celebrity MrBeast and another bid from adult content platform OnlyFans.

Trump has given Iran's leaders a two-month deadline to reach an agreement on the country's nuclear programme, which has strained relations with Western nations for decades. Western countries, including the United States, have long accused Iran of pursuing a nuclear weapon, which Tehran has denied, insisting its enrichment activities were solely for peaceful purposes. ""I think it's better if we have direct talks,"" he told reporters onboard the presidential plane Air Force One. ""I think it goes faster and you understand the other side a lot better than if you go through intermediaries."" Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said last week that Tehran would not engage in direct talks with Washington ""until there is a change in the other side's approach towards the Islamic Republic."" Trump in his first term ripped up a 2015 nuclear deal negotiated by predecessor Barack Obama and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran. The deal, sealed between Tehran and world powers, had required Iran to limit its nuclear ambitions in exchange for sanctions relief. ""They wanted to use intermediaries, I don't think that's necessarily true anymore,"" Trump said. ""I think they're concerned, I think they feel vulnerable. I don't want them to feel that way,"" he added. ""I think they want to meet."" Trump said last month he had written to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to call for nuclear negotiations and warn of possible military action if Tehran refused. Khamenei responded by saying that US threats ""will get them nowhere"" and warned of reciprocal measures ""if they do anything malign"" against Iran. Trump last week said ""there will be bombing"" of Iran if it does not drop its efforts to develop nuclear weapons.

RTHK,greater_china,China to impose tariffs of 34pc on all US goods,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798960-20250404.htm,"China on Friday announced the imposition of tariffs of 34 percent on all goods from the United States, as a countermeasure to the sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. US president Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a 34 percent tariff on Chinese imports. That was on top of the existing tariff of 20 percent. In a statement, the Ministry of Finance said the countermeasure will be effective from April 10. The Ministry of Commerce, meanwhile, said China has filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organisation (WTO), following the US slapping of what it called ""reciprocal tariffs"" on its trading partners. A spokesperson said the move by the US seriously violated WTO rules and damaged the legitimate rights of WTO members, slamming the US for endangering the stability of the global economic and trade order. The ministry also said it had decided to add 11 US firms to its unreliable entity list, with immediate effect, in order to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests.

RTHK,international,Israel kills Hamas 'commander' in Lebanon strike,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798944-20250404.htm,"Israel said it killed a commander of the Palestinian militant group Hamas on Friday in a strike in the Lebanese port city of Sidon that also killed his adult son and daughter. Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam condemned the strike as a ""flagrant attack on Lebanese sovereignty"" and a breach of the November 27 ceasefire with Israel. ""Overnight, the (army and the domestic security agency Shin Bet) conducted a targeted strike in the Sidon area, eliminating the terrorist Hassan Farhat, commander of Hamas's western arena in Lebanon,"" the Israeli military said in a statement. It alleged that Farhat had orchestrated multiple attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians during the hostilities that followed the outbreak of war in Gaza in October 2023. They included rocket fire on the Israeli town of Safed on February 14, 2024, that killed an Israeli soldier, the military added. The strike on a flat in a residential area of Sidon killed the official and his adult son and daughter, said a Palestinian official. A witness saw the fourth-floor flat still on fire after the strike, which caused heavy damage to the apartment block and neighbouring buildings and sparked panic in the densely populated neighbourhood. Lebanese state media had reported the 3:45 am (0045 GMT) strike on Sidon, saying at least three people were killed. ""A hostile drone raided a residential apartment... causing two successive explosions that led to a fire and extensive damage,"" the state-run National News Agency reported. Emergency workers rushed to the scene where they recovered ""the bodies of three martyrs,"" NNA said. The Lebanese prime minister called for ""maximum pressure on Israel to force it to halt these continual attacks which target various districts, many of them residential areas."" Israel struck south Beirut earlier this week, killing a Hezbollah Palestinian liaison officer in only the second raid on the capital since a November ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militant group. The Lebanese health ministry reported four dead in that strike, including a woman. Lebanese leaders condemned the attack, but Israel said it was in response to recent unclaimed rocket fire that Hezbollah insists it had no hand in. Hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah spiralled into all-out conflict last September, and the group remains a target of Israeli air strikes despite the November 27 ceasefire. Under the truce, Hezbollah is supposed to redeploy its forces north of the Litani River, about 30 kilometres from the Israeli border, and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure in the south.

RTHK,international,S Korea seizes two tons of cocaine in record bust,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798939-20250404.htm,"South Korea discovered and seized two tons of cocaine hidden aboard a Norwegian-flagged vessel, authorities said on Friday, marking the country's largest drug bust to date. The Korea Coast Guard said they had found ""two tons"" of what they suspect to be pure cocaine on a Norwegian-flagged vessel which had departed from Mexico and made stops in Ecuador, Panama, and China. The operation was launched after South Korean authorities received intelligence from US agencies – the FBI and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) – that the vessel was carrying hidden narcotics. The Korea Coast Guard and Korea Customs Service coordinated a large-scale search operation ""consisting of a joint search team of 90 officers... along with two drug-sniffing dog units,"" the Korea Coast Guard said. After the vessel docked at an east coast port in South Korea, the team immediately boarded the vessel and ""discovered a hidden compartment behind the ship's engine room."" The drugs were packed in 56 sacks, each holding some 30 to 40 kilogrammes of the drug, authorities said, bringing the total haul to around two tons. ""Preliminary field tests confirmed the substances as suspected cocaine,"" the Korea Coast Guard official said. ""The seizure is the largest in history, about five times bigger than the previous record, which was 404 kilogrammes of methamphetamine,"" said a Korea Customs Service official. The estimated street value is one trillion won (US$697 million), he added. Authorities have launched a joint investigation team to question the vessel's captain and crew about the origin and intended destination of the drugs, and the route used to transport them. Investigators also said they are looking into potential ties to international drug trafficking syndicates and will expand cooperation with the FBI and HSI. South Korea has long ranked among the countries with low drug use globally, thanks to its strict laws and strong social stigma.

RTHK,sport,Fernandez header powers Chelsea into fourth,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798934-20250404.htm,"Chelsea climbed to fourth place in the Premier League as Enzo Fernandez sealed a 1-0 win that piled pressure on beleaguered Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou on Thursday. Fernandez's thumping header early in the second half settled a bruising London derby at Stamford Bridge. Manchester City and Newcastle had both won on Wednesday to knock Chelsea from fourth down to sixth in the race to qualify for next season's Champions League. But Chelsea's response lifted them one point clear of fifth-placed City and two ahead of sixth-placed Newcastle. The top four are guaranteed to reach the Champions League, with fifth also likely to secure a place depending on the results of the English clubs left in European competitions this season. Chelsea, who have now lost just one of their past 13 league games against Tottenham, had been far from convincing recently, with boss Enzo Maresca criticised for his cautious tactics. Beaten 1-0 at Arsenal in their last game before the international break, Chelsea's players had a planned day off cancelled by Maresca due to a poor effort shown during an informal match against one of the club's youth sides. The Blues were more dynamic against Tottenham, but still lacked a cutting edge despite holding on for a fifth win in their last six games in all competitions. For Postecoglou, it was another dispiriting loss in a wretched season that could end with his sacking. Tottenham are without a victory in their last four league matches and have won only one of their last six games in all competitions. The north Londoners are languishing in 14th place after a 16th defeat from 30 league games. The last time they finished as low as 14th was in 2003-04, while their worst final position in the Premier League era was 15th in 1993-94. Tottenham fans have grown increasingly frustrated with their side's decline, staging a series of protests against chairman Daniel Levy. They turned on Postecoglou as well during the second half, chanting ""you don't know what you're doing"" at the Australian. Tottenham's last chance of ending their 17-year trophy drought and fulfilling Postecoglou's boast that he always wins a major prize in his second season lies in the Europa League, where they face Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-finals. Chelsea almost made the perfect start inside the first minute when Trevoh Chalobah's pass reached Nicolas Jackson, whose shot was saved by Guglielmo Vicario and hit Van de Ven before bouncing off the post. The Blues were on top in the opening minutes, and Malo Gusto's blast flashed just wide from the edge of the area. Vicario had to smother the ball on the goal-line after Fernandez tried to bundle home from Cole Palmer's deflected cross. Maresca had urged Jadon Sancho to provide more cutting edge amid mounting criticism of the winger's spluttering form during his loan from Manchester United. Sancho nearly rose to Maresca's challenge with a curling effort that Vicario brilliantly tipped over. Tottenham defender Cristian Romero pushed Levi Colwill to the ground in a clash that sparked a mass confrontation on the stroke of half-time. The row seemed to fire up Chelsea, and they finally made the breakthrough in the 50th minute. Palmer's cross picked out Fernandez, and the Argentine powered his header past Vicario from five yards. When Postecoglou sent on Brennan Johnson and Pape Sarr for Wilson Odobert and Lucas Bergvall, Tottenham fans taunted the Australian with derisive chants. For a few moments, it seemed Sarr had silenced Postecoglou's critics as he drilled home from long range in the 69th minute. But the goal was disallowed by VAR for Sarr's foul on Moises Caicedo, leaving Postecoglou shaking his head in frustration. Son Heung-min was inches away from rescuing Postecoglou in the 89th minute, only for Robert Sanchez to make a superb save from the forward's close-range shot.

""I think they are doing workshops in some schools to teach their students how they should respond or how they should behave when they are faced with threats, including internet bullying or sexual exploitation."" Police said there were 80 cases in Hong Kong related to child pornography last year, and about 80 percent of the cases were in relation to online activities. Officers said in a joint operation with authorities in Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, a total of 435 people were arrested over the past two months. They said some cases in other countries were found to involve AI-generated pornographic images, and officers warned that producing content involving child pornography electronically is also a crime.",2025-04-04 14:14:39

RTHK,local,HK manufacturers to wait-and-see amid Trump tariffs,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798915-20250404.htm,"The president of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong has voiced its strong opposition towards US President Donald Trump's latest round of levies. They were part of sweeping tariffs by the Republican leader directed at countries around the world on Thursday, including 34 percent tariff on goods from China. That's on top of the existing tax of 20 percent. Speaking on an RTHK radio programme on Friday, association chairman Wingco Lo pointed out that the move has affected the stability of global supply chains, and has damaged the international trade order. ""There are a lot of variables and uncertainties, so manufacturers do not dare to move when it comes to planning, he said. ""We will wait and see what the US is going to do. Because its policies often keep changing."" Lo noted that US firms and importers are also adopting a wait-and-see approach, and they might suspend placing an order, or doing it later than usual. In the short-run, there might be a shock effect on trade activities, he said. World leaders and businesses have expressed shock and concern by Trump's tariff barrage, with many markets taking a similar stance of not making any major moves. But Lo believes the imposition of tariffs are Trump's bargaining chip and will not last long. This is because Washington itself will also suffer from the move, especially its importers, ports, as well as retailers, according to Lo, and the measure would step up inflation and reduce consumer purchasing power. He added that Hong Kong manufacturers are encouraged to open up new markets, and set up production lines in places with low, or even no tariffs. Terence Chong, executive director of Chinese University's Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, told the same programme that while he anticipates the SAR's trade industry to suffer losses due to the levies, he expects the impact to be temporary. The situation will get better when people adapt to the reciprocal tariffs, he added.","Fri, 04 Apr 2025 12:02:33 +0800","The president of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong has voiced its strong opposition towards US President Donald Trump's latest round of levies.

RTHK,international,South Korea court upholds President Yoon's impeachment,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798910-20250404.htm,"South Korea's Constitutional Court on Friday decided to oust President Yoon Suk Yeol, upholding parliament's impeachment motion over his short-lived imposition of martial law last year that sparked the country's worst political crisis in decades. With Yoon's ouster, a presidential election is required to take place within 60 days, according to the country's constitution. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will continue to serve as acting president until the new president is inaugurated. The ruling caps months of political turmoil that have overshadowed efforts to deal with the new administration of U.S. President Donald Trump at a time of slowing growth. Separately, 64-year-old Yoon faces a criminal trial on insurrection charges. The embattled leader became the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested on January 15 but was released in March after a court cancelled his arrest warrant. The crisis was triggered by Yoon's December 3 declaration of martial law, which he has said was needed to root out ""anti-state"" elements and the opposition Democratic Party's alleged abuse of its parliamentary majority that he said was destroying the country. Yoon lifted the decree six hours later after lawmakers defied efforts by the security forces to seal off parliament and voted to reject it. Yoon has said he never intended to fully impose emergency military rule and tried to downplay the fallout, saying nobody was hurt. Months of protests have followed, and it remained unclear if the political chaos sparked by Yoon's martial law declaration will now be eased by the court ruling.

RTHK,international,Canada imposing 25% tariff on some US auto imports,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798895-20250404.htm,"Canada said it would impose a 25 percent tariff on tens of thousands of vehicles imported from the United States, retaliating against US President Donald Trump's levies that came into effect on Thursday. Prime Minister Mark Carney announced ""25 percent tariffs on all vehicles imported from the United States that are not compliant with CUSMA,"" using the Canadian acronym for an existing North American free trade agreement. The tariffs on US$25.3 billion worth of US vehicles are to come into force in the coming days, his office told AFP. The Canadian tariffs will impact cars and light trucks that are made with less than 75 percent North American parts, roughly 10 percent of all vehicles shipped from the United States to Canada, or about 67,000 vehicles annually. Canada was largely spared from the sweeping global tariffs Trump announced on Wednesday, as Washington granted an exemption to goods compliant with the US-Canada-Mexico free trade agreement, which covers most products. But Canada, which is one of America's largest trading partners, is still facing tariffs on steel, aluminum and other products, in addition to the levies on automobiles.

RTHK,international,Hungary to withdraw from ICC as Israeli leader visits,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798838-20250403.htm,"Hungary's government has decided to withdraw from the International Criminal Court, it said on Thursday, shortly after Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, sought under an ICC arrest warrant, arrived in the country for a state visit. Right-wing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban invited his Israeli counterpart to Budapest in November, a day after the ICC issued its arrest warrant over allegations of war crimes in Gaza, where Israel launched its offensive following an attack by Hamas-led fighters on southern Israel. Israel has rejected the accusations, which it says are politically motivated and fuelled by antisemitism. It says the ICC has lost all legitimacy by issuing the warrants against a democratically elected leader of a country exercising the right of self defence. As a founding member of the ICC, Hungary is theoretically obliged to arrest and hand over anyone subject to a warrant from the court but Orban made clear that Hungary would not respect the ruling, which he called ""brazen, cynical and completely unacceptable."" Hungary signed the ICC's founding document in 1999 and ratified it in 2001, but the law has not been promulgated. Gergely Gulyas, Orban's chief of staff, said in November that although Hungary ratified the Rome Statute of the ICC, it ""was never made part of Hungarian law,"" meaning that no measure of the court can be carried out within Hungary. On Thursday, Gulyas told state news agency MTI that the government would launch the withdrawal process later in the day. Orban had raised the prospect of Hungary's exit from the ICC after US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the court's prosecutor Karim Khan in February. ""It's time for Hungary to review what we're doing in an international organisation that is under US sanctions,"" Orban said on X in February. The bill on starting the year-long process of withdrawing from the ICC is likely to be approved by Hungary's parliament, which is dominated by Orban's Fidesz party. The Netherlands, which hosts the ICC, said that until withdrawal is complete, Hungary must still meet its duties. ""The full process to withdraw from the ICC takes about a year, during that time Hungary will have to fulfil all its obligations to the court,"" Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp told reporters on the sidelines of a Nato meeting in Brussels. Netanyahu has enjoyed strong support over the years from Hungary's Orban, an important ally who has been ready to block EU statements or actions critical of Israel in the past. ICC judges said when they issued the warrant that there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and his former defence chief were criminally responsible for acts including murder, persecution and starvation as a weapon of war as part of a ""widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza."" The Israeli campaign has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health authorities, and devastated the Gaza Strip. The Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, killed 1,200 people and saw more than 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. The ICC also issued an arrest warrant against a Hamas leader in November. His death was confirmed after the warrant was issued. (Reuters)","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 21:16:12 +0800","Hungary's government has decided to withdraw from the International Criminal Court, it said on Thursday, shortly after Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, sought under an ICC arrest warrant, arrived in the country for a state visit. Right-wing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban invited his Israeli counterpart to Budapest in November, a day after the ICC issued its arrest warrant over allegations of war crimes in Gaza, where Israel launched its offensive following an attack by Hamas-led fighters on southern Israel. Israel has rejected the accusations, which it says are politically motivated and fuelled by antisemitism. It says the ICC has lost all legitimacy by issuing the warrants against a democratically elected leader of a country exercising the right of self defence. As a founding member of the ICC, Hungary is theoretically obliged to arrest and hand over anyone subject to a warrant from the court but Orban made clear that Hungary would not respect the ruling, which he called ""brazen, cynical and completely unacceptable."" Hungary signed the ICC's founding document in 1999 and ratified it in 2001, but the law has not been promulgated. Gergely Gulyas, Orban's chief of staff, said in November that although Hungary ratified the Rome Statute of the ICC, it ""was never made part of Hungarian law,"" meaning that no measure of the court can be carried out within Hungary. On Thursday, Gulyas told state news agency MTI that the government would launch the withdrawal process later in the day. Orban had raised the prospect of Hungary's exit from the ICC after US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the court's prosecutor Karim Khan in February. ""It's time for Hungary to review what we're doing in an international organisation that is under US sanctions,"" Orban said on X in February.

Sinner received a three-month ban agreed with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in February after ""admitting ""partial responsibility"" for team mistakes. Ferrara, in his first public remarks on the scandal, laid the blame squarely at the door of Sinner's former physiotherapist Giacomo Naldi.

RTHK,finance,Tariffs will rebound on US: economists,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798796-20250403.htm,"The latest tariffs imposed by the United States will add to the country's own economic pains, complicate already heightened global trade and geopolitical tensions, and result in a backlash from many nations, according to economists. They were responding to US President Donald Trump's imposition of steep tariffs on imports from many countries, including 34 percent on China, 20 percent on the European Union, 46 percent on Vietnam and a baseline tariff of 10 percent for a wide range of other nations. ""Generally speaking, I do think that the tariffs imposed on all countries are definitely more than people expected, especially in some regions, even in the European Union,"" Dickie Wong, executive director of research at Kingston Securities, said in an interview with RTHK. He said the higher levies could complicate the already heightened trade tensions between the United States and almost ""every single country"" in the world, while having a negative effect on global financial markets, which plunged significantly following Trump's announcements. Wong also noted that the across-the-board tariff spikes will add to the pressures on the US Federal Reserve as it tries to reduce interest rates in the short to long term, especially now that the personal consumption expenditures price index – the Fed's preferred inflation gauge – has already shown signs of edging up. For his part, Ben Emons, chief market strategist at Strategic Fortune Wealth, said that ""what we're seeing to be playing out is that the US gross domestic product will contract even further from here [on]. ""The markets have already been very efficient to drag down the benchmark S&P 500 index by 10 percent from the peak."" He added that such declines are only the tip of the iceberg of a broader impact as the tariffs are gradually implemented and, in turn, reflected in hard data in the coming months. Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said that ""we have already revised down our growth forecast for the US currently to 1.4 percent for this year, and it's likely going to be revised down further. ""This is quite incredible because heading into Donald Trump's presidency, the US economy was in a very strong state, but within the time span of just a couple of months, he's managed to potentially undo all of that. ""That story of a strong American growth is dissipating and that will carry consequences for the rest of the world given that it's not just China but the entire Asian region that really relies on US demand as a driver of their own economic growth."" The latest tariffs are going to sting China as the 34 percent comes on top of an existing 20 percent that, when it comes into effect on April 9, will be closer to Trump’s campaign pledge of a 60 percent rate. Also among Trump's moves was an order to end duty exemptions on low-value shipments from China under the ""de minimis"" rule starting on May 2, which analysts said brings the trade war ""closer to home"", as many middle-income American households rely on the exemptions as part of daily e-commerce purchases. Noting that China was always bearing the brunt of America's trade policies, Marro said that Beijing this time must act more pro-actively in its response to such trade shocks, such as by boosting domestic consumption to offset the trade impact. ""Chinese officials need to act pro-actively respond to these shocks, not just in terms of cushioning exporters and producers, but also over what this means for reviving domestic consumption, ensuring that they can reflate the economy in ways that are sustained,"" he said. ""Domestic demand is really going to be one of the only ways for China to offset this external demand shock,"" he added. Singapore-based investment veteran Olivier d'Assier noted that Trump's tariffs will draw a backlash from many nations, as the level of increase far exceeds expectations and may not serve as the negotiation tool that the American president may have been hoping for. ""[So] if you say 10 percent or 15 percent, it gets people's attention,"" said d'Assier. ""They [the nations] come to the table, they negotiate some kind of deals. ""But if you say 30 percent, 40 percent, 54 percent, this would be unacceptable to most of these trading partners, and they will retaliate. ""And they have means to retaliate. ""I don't think Trump realizes this, but there are options for people [nations] to stay and wait. ""And I think that's the reaction he's going to get on these trade tariffs from China, from the EU, from Canada, and others."" D'Assier added that [the nations] will say, 'well, since your economy is the one that's going to take the pain initially, we'll just wait and see how long you can take it'"".","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 16:25:18 +0800","The latest tariffs imposed by the United States will add to the country's own economic pains, complicate already heightened global trade and geopolitical tensions, and result in a backlash from many nations, according to economists.

Wong also noted that the across-the-board tariff spikes will add to the pressures on the US Federal Reserve as it tries to reduce interest rates in the short to long term, especially now that the personal consumption expenditures price index – the Fed's preferred inflation gauge – has already shown signs of edging up. For his part, Ben Emons, chief market strategist at Strategic Fortune Wealth, said that ""what we're seeing to be playing out is that the US gross domestic product will contract even further from here [on]. ""The markets have already been very efficient to drag down the benchmark S&P 500 index by 10 percent from the peak."" He added that such declines are only the tip of the iceberg of a broader impact as the tariffs are gradually implemented and, in turn, reflected in hard data in the coming months. Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said that ""we have already revised down our growth forecast for the US currently to 1.4 percent for this year, and it's likely going to be revised down further. ""This is quite incredible because heading into Donald Trump's presidency, the US economy was in a very strong state, but within the time span of just a couple of months, he's managed to potentially undo all of that. ""That story of a strong American growth is dissipating and that will carry consequences for the rest of the world given that it's not just China but the entire Asian region that really relies on US demand as a driver of their own economic growth."" The latest tariffs are going to sting China as the 34 percent comes on top of an existing 20 percent that, when it comes into effect on April 9, will be closer to Trump’s campaign pledge of a 60 percent rate. Also among Trump's moves was an order to end duty exemptions on low-value shipments from China under the ""de minimis"" rule starting on May 2, which analysts said brings the trade war ""closer to home"", as many middle-income American households rely on the exemptions as part of daily e-commerce purchases. Noting that China was always bearing the brunt of America's trade policies, Marro said that Beijing this time must act more pro-actively in its response to such trade shocks, such as by boosting domestic consumption to offset the trade impact. ""Chinese officials need to act pro-actively respond to these shocks, not just in terms of cushioning exporters and producers, but also over what this means for reviving domestic consumption, ensuring that they can reflate the economy in ways that are sustained,"" he said. ""Domestic demand is really going to be one of the only ways for China to offset this external demand shock,"" he added. Singapore-based investment veteran Olivier d'Assier noted that Trump's tariffs will draw a backlash from many nations, as the level of increase far exceeds expectations and may not serve as the negotiation tool that the American president may have been hoping for. ""[So] if you say 10 percent or 15 percent, it gets people's attention,"" said d'Assier. ""They [the nations] come to the table, they negotiate some kind of deals. ""But if you say 30 percent, 40 percent, 54 percent, this would be unacceptable to most of these trading partners, and they will retaliate. ""And they have means to retaliate. ""I don't think Trump realizes this, but there are options for people [nations] to stay and wait. ""And I think that's the reaction he's going to get on these trade tariffs from China, from the EU, from Canada, and others."" D'Assier added that [the nations] will say, 'well, since your economy is the one that's going to take the pain initially, we'll just wait and see how long you can take it'"".",2025-04-03 16:25:18

The first batch of aid, including tents, blankets and first aid kits arrived in Yangon on Monday, Beijing has said. The United States, which was until recently the world's top humanitarian donor, has offered a relatively modest US$2 million. Washington also said it would send a three-member assessment team, though their arrival has been delayed by problems obtaining visas from the military regime. In past years, when tsunamis, earthquakes and other disasters struck around the world, the United States had regularly and rapidly deployed skilled rescue workers to save lives. The American absence shows how President Donald Trump's moves to slash the size of the US government has hobbled its ability to act during disasters, three current and former US officials said. With Trump's blessings, billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has enacted huge funding cuts and contractor terminations across the federal bureaucracy in the name of targeting wasteful spending. Trump has also moved to fire nearly all US Agency for International Development staff, who oversee Washington's disaster response efforts overseas.

It said imported goods from mainland China and Hong Kong sent outside the international postal network and valued at or under US$800 would now be subject to all applicable duties.

RTHK,finance,US trade tariff 'not act of a friend': Albanese,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798732-20250403.htm,"Donald Trump's trade tariffs on close ally Australia are ""not the act of a friend"" and will hurt the two nations' relationship, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday.

Record 31-time winners Barca had the better of the clash at the Metropolitano stadium after the wild 4-4 first leg draw, and defeat leaves Diego Simeone's Atlético with little to play for in the rest of the season. By contrast the Catalans are on the hunt for a potential quadruple and are unbeaten in 2025, stretching their run to 21 games without defeat. Atlético were the last team to triumph against Barcelona, winning before Christmas to go top of La Liga, but they now trail Hansi Flick's team by nine points with nine matches remaining. ""We can't relax, we have to keep believing and working, with humility and I'm sure good things will come,"" Torres said. ""If a final is already a huge motivation, imagine playing against your most direct rival."" Flick brought winger Raphinha back into Barcelona's starting line-up and the hosts tried to shut him down through fair means or foul. César Azpilicueta was booked for one tackle, surviving a VAR review for a potential red card, while Rodrigo de Paul was also cautioned for going in hard on the Brazilian. Teenage winger Lamine Yamal ran the show on the other flank for Barcelona, firing wide and teeing up Jules Kounde, who bypassed Robin Le Normand with some neat juggling before lashing over. The 17-year-old played in Torres for Barcelona's opener with a well-weighted pass, finished clinically by the former Manchester City forward, who has earned more minutes with his recent performances. Yamal mishit a shot himself from a good position in the box, while Atlético goalkeeper Juan Musso denied Raphinha at his near post. Simeone brought on Alexander Sorloth among three changes at the break, after he scored three goals in the three previous meetings between these sides this season. Perhaps convinced he would make it four in four, Sorloth fired narrowly wide early in the second half with Antoine Griezmann open and ready for a simple finish. At the other end, Raphinha forced another save from Musso but was himself guilty of not squaring for Fermín López. Sorloth rattled home what he thought for a few seconds was an equaliser, but he had strayed offside. With Atlético ascendant, Flick brought on top goalscorer Robert Lewandowski for Torres, but the Polish veteran struggled to get involved.

RTHK,sport,Stuttgart beat Leipzig to reach German Cup final,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798718-20250403.htm,"Stuttgart set up a German Cup final clash with third-division Arminia Bielefeld after a 3-1 win over RB Leipzig. Under the watchful eyes of Jurgen Klopp, the new head of global soccer for Leipzig's owners Red Bull, the visitors were outclassed by a strong Stuttgart side. Goals from Angelo Stiller, Nick Woltemade and Jamie Leweling took Stuttgart to victory, putting them on track for a first German Cup triumph since 1997. The victory continues Stuttgart's rise since former Leipzig youth-team coach Sebastian Hoeness took over in April 2023. ""We're going to Berlin,"" Hoeness said. ""Unbelievable. The lads are unbelievable, it's incredible. It's a dream to travel to Berlin."" ""We rewarded ourselves with goals at the right moment and when we needed to we defended with passion,"" he added. The coach ended his post-match interview early before sprinting across the field to have his picture taken with the rest of the squad in front of the club's ecstatic home fans. Hoeness has become one of the most sought-after coaches in Europe, having led Stuttgart from relegation candidates to runners-up last season, and now the German Cup final. The five-time German champions and three-time cup winners will be heavy favourites in Berlin in May, against a Bielefeld side who stunned holders Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday. Leipzig, winners of two of the past three German Cups, had a chaotic lead-up to the match. On Sunday, the Saxons fired coach Marco Rose, who led them to the trophy two seasons ago, replacing him with interim boss Zsolt Low. Klopp, a close friend of Rose who brought him to the club while coaching Mainz in 2002 but who signed off on Sunday's decision, was spotted watching on from the stands on Wednesday. Stiller put the hosts on track five minutes in, smacking home an unstoppable volley from outside the box to give Stuttgart the lead. Leipzig were stunned but took control soon after. Visiting striker Lois Openda was kept at bay despite three clear chances between the 15 and 35-minute marks. Woltemade doubled Stuttgart's lead 12 minutes into the second half, sliding the ball under the goalkeeper after a clever one-two with Ermedin Demirovic. Leipzig hit back almost immediately when Sesko hammered in with 62 minutes gone after beating the offside trap. The visitors were in the ascendancy and an equaliser looked likely until Woltemade headed goalwards from a Stiller cross, with the ball bouncing to Leweling who tapped in from two yards out. Three-time winners Stuttgart have not qualified for the final since 2013, when they lost to a treble-bound Bayern, and last won in 1997. Founded in 2009 and promoted to the top flight for the first time in 2016, Leipzig had previously won four from four German Cup semi-finals.

With just eight games left, Liverpool sit 12 points clear of second-placed Arsenal, who beat Fulham 2-1 on Tuesday. Arne Slot's side had lost their previous two games in the League Cup final against Newcastle and the Champions League last 16 against Paris Saint-Germain. But they got back on track in their march towards a record-equalling 20th English title and first since 2020 in Slot's maiden season in charge. Having gone over two months without a goal, Diogo Jota was Liverpool's hero as he ended his drought in the 57th minute, slotting home from Luis Díaz's flick. It was an especially sweet win for Liverpool after their stormy 2-2 draw at Everton in February, which featured a last-gasp equaliser for David Moyes' team. At the Etihad Stadium, City coped just fine without Norway striker Erling Haaland, who will be sidelined for up to seven weeks after suffering an ankle injury in Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final win at Bournemouth. Pep Guardiola's men took just two minutes to go in front against second-bottom Leicester, who have lost seven successive league games. Jeremy Doku and Savinho combined to carve open the Leicester defence before Jack Grealish slotted home from close range for his first league goal since December 2023. Grealish's long-awaited goal was missed by hundreds of City fans, who stayed outside the stadium for the first nine minutes in protest at the club's deal with a third-party ticket resale company. The protestors did get to see City double their advantage in the 29th minute as Egypt forward Omar Marmoush lashed home after Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen made a hash of dealing with Ruben Dias's pass. City are up to fourth place, one point ahead of fifth-placed Newcastle and two in front of sixth-placed Chelsea, who face Tottenham in their game in hand on Thursday. The top four qualify for the Champions League automatically, while fifth place is likely to also provide a berth in Europe's elite club competition. Newcastle beat Brentford 2-1 to maintain the party mood after the prolonged celebrations of their first major trophy for 56 years. Eddie Howe's side were back in action for the first time since beating Liverpool in the League Cup final.

Travel agencies in Hong Kong, meanwhile, said more people from the SAR have visited Tibet since the launch of a direct flight in February. The Potala Palace in Lhasa is considered a must-see attraction by many travellers. Speaking in an interview with RTHK, Kunga Tashi, deputy director at the palace's management office, said the number of tourists has increased notably after the pandemic, rising by up to 30 percent each year over the past two years. He said there are moves to limit the number of visitors, to ensure better tourism experience and protect the landmark. ""If we look at 2024, the number of trips was about 2.01 million. We have set restrictions on the visitor headcount to the palace, capped at 7,000 each day,"" he said. The number of visits by Hong Kong travellers to Tibet is on the rise after a direct flight service between the SAR and Lhasa was launched in late February. This came after Beijing announced the expansion of the Individual Visit Scheme last year to allow residents from Lhasa to visit the SAR on a solo basis, instead of being part of a tour group. Some SAR agencies told RTHK more people have expressed interest in heading to Tibet since the launch of the direct flight, and group tours have been fully booked through May.

Travel agencies in Hong Kong, meanwhile, said more people from the SAR have visited Tibet since the launch of a direct flight in February. The Potala Palace in Lhasa is considered a must-see attraction by many travellers. Speaking in an interview with RTHK, Kunga Tashi, deputy director at the palace's management office, said the number of tourists has increased notably after the pandemic, rising by up to 30 percent each year over the past two years. He said there are moves to limit the number of visitors, to ensure better tourism experience and protect the landmark. ""If we look at 2024, the number of trips was about 2.01 million. We have set restrictions on the visitor headcount to the palace, capped at 7,000 each day,"" he said. The number of visits by Hong Kong travellers to Tibet is on the rise after a direct flight service between the SAR and Lhasa was launched in late February. This came after Beijing announced the expansion of the Individual Visit Scheme last year to allow residents from Lhasa to visit the SAR on a solo basis, instead of being part of a tour group.

RTHK,greater_china,Beijing puts store in EVs for shoring up power grids,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798596-20250402.htm,"China plans to launch pilot projects in nine cities that would use the country's growing fleet of electric vehicles as batteries to shore up power supply on the grid during spikes in demand, according to a government announcement on Wednesday. The move follows on rules issued last year by state planner the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to strengthen the integration of new energy vehicles with the grid amid concerns the rapid adoption of EVs would overwhelm the generation and transmission systems. The majority of the 30 projects in cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou are vehicle-to-grid or V2G, according to the announcement by the NDRC and energy regulator. Cars would act as batteries, storing power and sending it back into the grid. Grid-connected cars could also adjust their charging times to avoid peak periods and provide critical services such as frequency regulation. Providing those services could potentially become an alternative revenue stream for homeowners or operators of charging stations. According to the notice, power grid companies are responsible for setting up the pilots, and provincial governments should lead the development of charging facilities. The energy regulator is tasked with supporting the participation of grid-connected vehicle applications in power trading. Last year, NDRC said it would set up over 50 pilot programmes by 2025. However, industry experts say there are a range of hurdles to overcome before the large-scale adoption of V2G, such as developing viable business models. NDRC also said in the 2024 rule that battery technologies need to be improved.

Curry, the NBA's all-time leader in three-point shooting, once again demonstrated his long-range prowess, draining 12-of-20 attempts from outside the arc at Memphis's FedExForum. The 37-year-old's dazzling shooting performance helped the Warriors vault over the Grizzlies into fifth place in the Western Conference standings, edging them closer to an automatic playoff berth. The Warriors improved to 44-31 while the Grizzlies dropped to sixth place with a 44-32 record. The top six finishers in the West qualify automatically for the postseason. Curry's masterpiece – his second 50-point game of the season and the 15th of his career – was backed by a triple from defensive linchpin Green and 27 points from Jimmy Butler. Green finished with 13 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists. Warriors coach Steve Kerr lavished praise on Curry's virtuoso display that has left Golden State firmly on course for the playoffs. ""The guy's 37 years old, it's incredible,"" Kerr said. ""Fifty-two points with people draped all over him all game long. The conditioning, the skill, the audacity, the belief, it's incredible to watch Steph at work. ""I can't believe he's still doing this at this age. But he's put the work in and he's still got it."" Grizzlies interim coach Tuomas Iisalo, who took over the team last week following the shock dismissal of Taylor Jenkins, was similarly effusive of Curry's performance. ""It's a sight to behold how he operates,"" Iisalo said, revealing that the team had been helpless to stop a first-quarter onslaught from Curry that included 19 points. ""In the first quarter we had a specific strategy that we do not want him to get three-point shots – and he found a way to get going anyway. It's very hard to stop a player of that caliber,"" he added. ""Once he gets into that zone, it's very difficult to get him,"" he continued. ""I mean, we're talking about the best movement shooter of all time."" Memphis, who trailed by as many as 17 points in the first quarter, were left ruing their inability to sustain a second-half rally which saw them open up a four-point lead with just under four minutes remaining. Ja Morant led the Grizzlies' scoring with 36 points while Jaren Jackson Jr. added 22. ""Everybody's hurting in that locker room right now,"" Iisalo said. ""It really hurts when you put everything on the line and you come up a little short. But that's life, that's sports."" Elsewhere, Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 37 points as the Milwaukee Bucks snapped a four-game losing streak with a 133-123 victory over the Phoenix Suns. Devin Booker scored 39 points for Phoenix but it was not enough to prevent the Suns from falling to a fourth consecutive defeat – a late-season mini-slump that has imperiled their playoff hopes.

Xabi Alonso's side were heavily favoured to reach their second successive final but were outclassed from start to finish by their underdog opponents. Jonathan Tah's 17th-minute goal was cancelled out by a Marius Woerl strike for the hosts three minutes later. Maximilian Grosser's goal in first-half stoppage time would prove the difference for Bielefeld, who have now beaten four top-division opponents on their way to the final. Bielefeld, who have never made a German Cup final, became just the fourth third-division team to reach the showpiece event.

Leverkusen coach Alonso came into the game having never lost in 10 matches in the competition and needed just one more victory to beat Louis van Gaal's all-time record set as Bayern Munich manager. Everything seemed to go according to plan when Leverkusen took the lead after 17 minutes, Tah tapping in unmarked at the far post. The hosts hit back almost immediately however, Woerl taking advantage of a sloppy clearance attempt by Piero Hincapie to curl the ball home. As the half wore on, Leverkusen were unable to make their possession count, with Bielefeld fast and threatening on the counter. The hosts once again caught Leverkusen napping to take the lead moments before halftime, Grosser hammering in a Louis Oppie free kick from close range. Bielefeld continued to out-energise their opponents, fighting in the duels and giving Leverkusen few chances to drag themselves back into the game. Patrick Schick, so often Leverkusen's late hero over the past two seasons, had a chance to level the scores while unmarked after 81 minutes but hit a header against the post. This year's German Cup is one of the more open in recent memory, with recent champions Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Eintracht Frankfurt all suffering early eliminations from the competition.

On the losing end of Wall Street was Johnson & Johnson, which dropped 7.6 percent after a US bankruptcy court judge denied the company’s settlement plan related to baby powder containing talc. It’s the third time the company’s attempt to resolve the baby powder settlement through bankruptcy has been rejected by courts. Lululemon Athletica led the market lower with a drop of 14.2 percent, even though the seller of athletic apparel reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Oxford Industries, the company behind the Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands, likewise reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected but still saw its stock fall 5.7 percent.

RTHK,sport,Real Madrid hold Real Sociedad in eight-goal thriller,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798540-20250402.htm,"Real Madrid edged into the Copa del Rey final with a thrilling 4-4 draw against Real Sociedad after extra-time, securing a 5-4 aggregate semi-final victory. Antonio Rudiger decided the pulsating tie with a header in the 115th minute, with Madrid to face Barcelona or Atletico Madrid in the final. Real Sociedad, trailing 1-0 from the first leg, took the lead through Ander Barrenetxea, but Endrick's fine chip pulled the 20-time winners level. A David Alaba own goal and Mikel Oyarzabal's deflected effort helped La Real open up a lead on the Spanish champions but Madrid battled back with goals from Jude Bellingham and Aurelien Tchouameni. Oyarzabal grabbed his second in stoppage time to force extra-time but his side could not hold off Madrid until penalties, with Rudiger's header the final word. ""I'm very happy because it was a really hard game with many comebacks and in the end my goal,"" Rudiger said. ""For me (the goal) was easy, (I made a) good movement, the corner was very good and because of that we're in the final,"" he added. ""It's a hard season but we're in another final and we will win it."" Ancelotti brought Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo Goes back into his starting lineup, leaving Kylian Mbappé on the bench to rest, with Endrick taking his place in an all-Brazilian attack. The 18-year-old wonderkid striker who netted the only goal in the first leg, was active in the opening phases, sending a dangerous overhead kick narrowly wide of Álex Remiro's far post. Bellingham also threatened for the hosts but it was Real Sociedad who took the lead. Barrenetxea broke in behind Lucas Vázquez to reach Pablo Marin's flick-on and drilled a low finish home to put the Basques level in the tie. Real Madrid soon found their equaliser. Vinicius played a sensational through ball down the left flank with the outside of his foot, sending Endrick in on goal. The youngster, top scorer in the Copa del Rey, produced a gorgeous lobbed finish over Romero for his fifth in the competition. Real Sociedad appealed for a penalty before the break when Takefusa Kubo went down in the box after being held by Vinicius, but the referee did not concur. Ancelotti brought on Mbappé for Endrick, looking for a goal to shut the tie down for good. However, it was the visitors who were creating the better chances. Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin made a superb save to deny Martin Zubimendi and Oyarzabal wastefully fired the rebound wide. Real Sociedad moved ahead on the night when Alaba deflected Marin's cross through Lunin's legs and into his own net after 72 minutes. The Austrian defender, who returned from a long-term injury in January, was also involved in Real Sociedad's third, deflecting Oyarzabal's shot past Lunin. It sparked Madrid in to action, with Vinicius turning his marker brilliantly, driving forward and crossing for Bellingham to strike in the 82nd minute. Four minutes later and Los Blancos pulled level on the night with Tchouameni's header badly fumbled by Remiro into his own net. Just when it seemed Real Sociedad were out they managed to force extra-time, with Oyarzabal heading home Sergio Gómez's free-kick in the 93rd minute. Remiro saved well from Bellingham before the end of the regulation 90 minutes, with the pace slower, inevitably, as the game restarted. Real Sociedad's Jon Olagasti was booked for hacking down Vinicius as he threatened to escape on the left, with the visitors working hard to hold off the European champions. With five minutes remaining Rudiger sent Madrid through to the final with a fine header from Arda Guler's corner past the helpless Remiro. On Wednesday Atletico Madrid host Barcelona in the second leg of the other semi-final, with the teams level at 4-4 on aggregate.

RTHK,greater_china,Xiaomi hands over data in fatal SU7 crash in Anhui,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798464-20250401.htm,"Xiaomi said on Tuesday that it was actively cooperating with police after a fatal accident involving a SU7 electric vehicle on Saturday and that it had handed over driving and system data. The incident marks the first major accident involving the SU7 sedan, which Xiaomi launched last March and since December has outsold Tesla's Model 3 on a monthly basis. Xiaomi's shares, which had risen by 34.8 percent year to date, closed down 5.5 percent on Tuesday, underperforming a 0.2 percent gain in the Hang Seng Tech index. Xiaomi did not disclose the number of casualties but said initial information showed the car was in the Navigate on Autopilot (NOA) intelligent-assisted driving mode before the accident and was moving at 116kmh. A driver inside the car took over and tried to slow it down but then collided with a cement pole at a speed of 97kmh, Xiaomi said. The accident in Tongling in eastern Anhui province killed the driver and two passengers, Chinese financial publication Caixin reported on Tuesday citing friends of the victims. In a rundown of the data submitted to local police posted on a Weibo account of the company, Xiaomi said NOA issued a risk warning of obstacles ahead and its subsequent immediate takeover only happened seconds before the collision. Local media reported that the car caught fire after the collision. Xiaomi did not mention the fire in the statement. Xiaomi began manufacturing EVs last year with the launch of the SU7 sedan after selling smartphones, household appliances and smart gadgets for most of its 15-year history. The company has two versions of smart driving systems on its SU7 EVs. The higher-end LiDAR-mounted version, as opposed to the pure vision version, enables urban navigation features such as collision avoidance and special vehicle recognition. Xiaomi said the car involved in the accident was a standard version of the SU7, which has the less-advanced smart driving technology without LiDAR.
