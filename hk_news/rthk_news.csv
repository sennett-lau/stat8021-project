RTHK,local,HK manufacturers to wait-and-see amid Trump tariffs,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798915-20250404.htm,"The president of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong has voiced its strong opposition towards US President Donald Trump's latest round of levies. They were part of sweeping tariffs by the Republican leader directed at countries around the world on Thursday, including 34 percent tariff on goods from China. That's on top of the existing tax of 20 percent. Speaking on an RTHK radio programme on Friday, association chairman Wingco Lo pointed out that the move has affected the stability of global supply chains, and has damaged the international trade order. ""There are a lot of variables and uncertainties, so manufacturers do not dare to move when it comes to planning, he said. ""We will wait and see what the US is going to do. Because its policies often keep changing."" Lo noted that US firms and importers are also adopting a wait-and-see approach, and they might suspend placing an order, or doing it later than usual. In the short-run, there might be a shock effect on trade activities, he said. World leaders and businesses have expressed shock and concern by Trump's tariff barrage, with many markets taking a similar stance of not making any major moves. But Lo believes the imposition of tariffs are Trump's bargaining chip and will not last long. This is because Washington itself will also suffer from the move, especially its importers, ports, as well as retailers, according to Lo, and the measure would step up inflation and reduce consumer purchasing power. He added that Hong Kong manufacturers are encouraged to open up new markets, and set up production lines in places with low, or even no tariffs. Terence Chong, executive director of Chinese University's Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, told the same programme that while he anticipates the SAR's trade industry to suffer losses due to the levies, he expects the impact to be temporary.

RTHK,greater_china,Chinese rescuers fill vacuum US cuts leave in Myanmar,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798770-20250403.htm,"After a 7.7 magnitude earthquake shook Myanmar on Friday, killing more than 2,800 people, international rescuers rushed into the devastated Southeast Asian country. The most ubiquitous among them have been Chinese relief workers, whose blue and orange uniforms appear across videos circulating on social media. The posts are often accompanied with expressions of gratitude toward Beijing, whose first responders – as well as their Indian and Russian colleagues – have pulled dazed survivors and bodies out from the rubble of hotels, schools, and monasteries. America's chief geopolitical rival has so far pledged to deliver 100 million yuan worth of supplies. The first batch of aid, including tents, blankets and first aid kits arrived in Yangon on Monday, Beijing has said. The United States, which was until recently the world's top humanitarian donor, has offered a relatively modest US$2 million. Washington also said it would send a three-member assessment team, though their arrival has been delayed by problems obtaining visas from the military regime. In past years, when tsunamis, earthquakes and other disasters struck around the world, the United States had regularly and rapidly deployed skilled rescue workers to save lives. The American absence shows how President Donald Trump's moves to slash the size of the US government has hobbled its ability to act during disasters, three current and former US officials said. With Trump's blessings, billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has enacted huge funding cuts and contractor terminations across the federal bureaucracy in the name of targeting wasteful spending.

A functional USAID would have activated urban search-and-rescue teams that were capable of being deployed to Myanmar in 48 hours, said Marcia Wong, formerly a top humanitarian official at USAID. But most of the people who would have coordinated the response have been let go, while third-party partners have lost contracts, she said.

(Reuters)","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 12:04:25 +0800","After a 7.7 magnitude earthquake shook Myanmar on Friday, killing more than 2,800 people, international rescuers rushed into the devastated Southeast Asian country. The most ubiquitous among them have been Chinese relief workers, whose blue and orange uniforms appear across videos circulating on social media. The posts are often accompanied with expressions of gratitude toward Beijing, whose first responders – as well as their Indian and Russian colleagues – have pulled dazed survivors and bodies out from the rubble of hotels, schools, and monasteries. America's chief geopolitical rival has so far pledged to deliver 100 million yuan worth of supplies. The first batch of aid, including tents, blankets and first aid kits arrived in Yangon on Monday, Beijing has said. The United States, which was until recently the world's top humanitarian donor, has offered a relatively modest US$2 million. Washington also said it would send a three-member assessment team, though their arrival has been delayed by problems obtaining visas from the military regime. In past years, when tsunamis, earthquakes and other disasters struck around the world, the United States had regularly and rapidly deployed skilled rescue workers to save lives.

The majority of the 30 projects in cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou are vehicle-to-grid or V2G, according to the announcement by the NDRC and energy regulator. Cars would act as batteries, storing power and sending it back into the grid.

The drills serve as a stern warning and forceful deterrent against ""Taiwan independence"" separatist forces, and are a legitimate and necessary action to safeguard China's sovereignty and national unity, Shi said. Meanwhile, Taiwan Affairs Office spokeswoman Zhu Fenglian said the military exercises serve as a resolute punishment for Lai Ching-te authorities' blatant ""Taiwan independence"" provocations. ""'Taiwan independence' means war, and pursuing 'Taiwan independence' means pushing the people of Taiwan into a perilous situation,"" Zhu said. She also said the mainland's countermeasures specifically target separatist activities advocating ""Taiwan independence"" and are not directed at the broader population of Taiwan.

The March 28 quake flattened buildings and destroyed infrastructure across the country, resulting in 3,354 deaths and 4,508 people injured, with 220 others missing, according to new figures published by state media. More than one week after the disaster, many people in the country are still without shelter, either forced to sleep outdoors because their homes were destroyed or wary of further collapses. A United Nations estimate suggests that more than three million people may have been affected by the 7.7-magnitude quake, compounding previous challenges caused by four years of civil war. The UN's top aid official on Saturday met with victims in the central Myanmar city of Mandalay – situated close to the epicentre and now grappling with severe damage across the city. ""The destruction is staggering,"" Tom Fletcher wrote in a post on X. ""The world must rally behind the people of Myanmar.""

RTHK,international,"Tariffs to raise inflation, cool growth: Fed Chair",https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798991-20250405.htm,"US President Donald Trump's tariffs risk higher unemployment and will likely cause inflation to rise and growth to slow, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday. Trump's dramatic trade measures announced earlier this week have tightened scrutiny of Powell and how the Fed will react to free falling financial markets and concerns that a prolonged trade war would ramp up consumer prices and joblessness rates. ""The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,"" Powell told an event in Virginia., adding that it was ""too soon"" to consider changes to US monetary policy. Powell spoke just minutes after Trump posted on social media, urging him to cut interest rates immediately and accusing him of playing politics in his role running the independent US central bank. The larger-than-expected tariffs unveiled on Wednesday stack on top of earlier country-specific levies, meaning that China, for example, will now face a new levy totalling 54 percent. Other top trading partners will also see higher rates, with the European Union now facing a 20 percent tariff from April 9, and India looking at a 26 percent levy. The Trump administration has also targeted specific sectors of the economy, recently slapping a 25 percent tariff on automobiles not made in the United States. Powell said Friday that he expected the current uncertainty to decline in the coming months. Powell's comments suggest the Fed is in no rush to cut its benchmark lending rate from its current elevated level of between 4.25 and 4.50 percent, as it continues its struggle to bring inflation down to its long-term two percent target. In recent months, the Fed's progress in bringing inflation down to target has stalled, while growth has remained solid and the unemployment rate has hugged close to historic lows. Faced with this data, the Fed voted last month to extend its pause in rate cuts and signalled that it wanted to see how the new administration's policies would feed through to the economy before taking any action. Fed policymakers - now including Powell - have warned that tariffs could cause prices to rise, with the extent of the price increase likely determined by the rollout of the levies and how consumers and businesses respond. Ahead of Powell's speech on Friday, Donald Trump took to his Truth Social account to insist that his tariff policy would not change despite the market reaction and called on Powell to act. ""CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!"" wrote Trump, who first nominated Powell to run the Fed, before turning against him during his first term. Speaking Friday, Powell insisted he had no plans to step down as Fed chair before his term ends next year. ""I fully intend to serve all of my term,"" he said during the Virginia event.

RTHK,international,Trump extends TikTok deadline to find buyer,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798987-20250405.htm,"US President Donald Trump on Friday extended the deadline for TikTok to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a ban in the United States, allowing 75 more days to find a solution. ""My administration has been working very hard on a deal to save TikTok, and we have made tremendous progress,"" Trump said on Truth Social, just hours before the deadline was to expire. ""A transaction requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days."" The hugely popular video-sharing app, which has well over 170 million American users, is under threat from a US law that passed overwhelmingly last year and orders TikTok to split from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, or get shut down in the United States. Trump has insisted his administration is near a deal to find a buyer for TikTok and keep it from shutting down that would involve multiple investors but has given few details. Motivated by national security fears and belief in Washington that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese government, the ban took effect on January 19, one day before Trump's inauguration. In the hours before that deadline, TikTok was temporarily shut down in the United States and disappeared from app stores, to the dismay of millions of users. But the Republican president quickly announced an initial 75-day delay, and TikTok subsequently restored service to users, returning to the Apple and Google app stores in February. The new 75-day delay pushes the deadline to June 19. The president added on Friday that he would ""continue working in good faith with China."" The president suggested TikTok could even be part of a broader deal with China to ease the stinging tariffs he imposed on Beijing as part of a worldwide blitz of levies. According to reports, the solution in the works would see existing US investors in ByteDance roll over their stakes into a new independent global TikTok company. Additional US investors, including Oracle and Blackstone, the private equity firm, would be brought on to reduce ByteDance's share. ABC News reported on Friday that Walmart was also in the mix. Uncertainty remains, particularly over what would happen to TikTok's valuable algorithm. ""TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand – it's simply not as powerful,"" said Forrester Principal Analyst Kelsey Chickering. Amazon has also reportedly made a last-minute bid to buy TikTok. Other proposals include an initiative called ""The People's Bid for TikTok"", launched by real estate and sports tycoon Frank McCourt's Project Liberty initiative. Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity recently expressed interest in buying TikTok, as did a joint venture involving YouTube mega-celebrity MrBeast and another bid from adult content platform OnlyFans.

""A transaction requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days."" The hugely popular video-sharing app, which has well over 170 million American users, is under threat from a US law that passed overwhelmingly last year and orders TikTok to split from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, or get shut down in the United States. Trump has insisted his administration is near a deal to find a buyer for TikTok and keep it from shutting down that would involve multiple investors but has given few details. Motivated by national security fears and belief in Washington that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese government, the ban took effect on January 19, one day before Trump's inauguration. In the hours before that deadline, TikTok was temporarily shut down in the United States and disappeared from app stores, to the dismay of millions of users. But the Republican president quickly announced an initial 75-day delay, and TikTok subsequently restored service to users, returning to the Apple and Google app stores in February. The new 75-day delay pushes the deadline to June 19. The president added on Friday that he would ""continue working in good faith with China."" The president suggested TikTok could even be part of a broader deal with China to ease the stinging tariffs he imposed on Beijing as part of a worldwide blitz of levies. According to reports, the solution in the works would see existing US investors in ByteDance roll over their stakes into a new independent global TikTok company. Additional US investors, including Oracle and Blackstone, the private equity firm, would be brought on to reduce ByteDance's share. ABC News reported on Friday that Walmart was also in the mix. Uncertainty remains, particularly over what would happen to TikTok's valuable algorithm. ""TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand – it's simply not as powerful,"" said Forrester Principal Analyst Kelsey Chickering. Amazon has also reportedly made a last-minute bid to buy TikTok. Other proposals include an initiative called ""The People's Bid for TikTok"", launched by real estate and sports tycoon Frank McCourt's Project Liberty initiative. Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity recently expressed interest in buying TikTok, as did a joint venture involving YouTube mega-celebrity MrBeast and another bid from adult content platform OnlyFans.

RTHK,international,Trump wants 'direct talks' with Iran on nukes deal,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798967-20250404.htm,"US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he wanted ""direct talks"" with Tehran on a nuclear deal, after he threatened to bomb Iran if it develops nuclear weapons. Trump has given Iran's leaders a two-month deadline to reach an agreement on the country's nuclear programme, which has strained relations with Western nations for decades. Western countries, including the United States, have long accused Iran of pursuing a nuclear weapon, which Tehran has denied, insisting its enrichment activities were solely for peaceful purposes. ""I think it's better if we have direct talks,"" he told reporters onboard the presidential plane Air Force One. ""I think it goes faster and you understand the other side a lot better than if you go through intermediaries."" Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said last week that Tehran would not engage in direct talks with Washington ""until there is a change in the other side's approach towards the Islamic Republic."" Trump in his first term ripped up a 2015 nuclear deal negotiated by predecessor Barack Obama and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran. The deal, sealed between Tehran and world powers, had required Iran to limit its nuclear ambitions in exchange for sanctions relief. ""They wanted to use intermediaries, I don't think that's necessarily true anymore,"" Trump said. ""I think they're concerned, I think they feel vulnerable. I don't want them to feel that way,"" he added. ""I think they want to meet."" Trump said last month he had written to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to call for nuclear negotiations and warn of possible military action if Tehran refused. Khamenei responded by saying that US threats ""will get them nowhere"" and warned of reciprocal measures ""if they do anything malign"" against Iran. Trump last week said ""there will be bombing"" of Iran if it does not drop its efforts to develop nuclear weapons. Trump's outreach comes at a weak point for the Islamic Republic after Israel decimated two of its allies – Hamas, the Palestinian militants who attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, and Lebanon's Hezbollah.

In a statement, the Ministry of Finance said the countermeasure will be effective from April 10.

RTHK,international,Israel kills Hamas 'commander' in Lebanon strike,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798944-20250404.htm,"Israel said it killed a commander of the Palestinian militant group Hamas on Friday in a strike in the Lebanese port city of Sidon that also killed his adult son and daughter. Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam condemned the strike as a ""flagrant attack on Lebanese sovereignty"" and a breach of the November 27 ceasefire with Israel. ""Overnight, the (army and the domestic security agency Shin Bet) conducted a targeted strike in the Sidon area, eliminating the terrorist Hassan Farhat, commander of Hamas's western arena in Lebanon,"" the Israeli military said in a statement. It alleged that Farhat had orchestrated multiple attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians during the hostilities that followed the outbreak of war in Gaza in October 2023. They included rocket fire on the Israeli town of Safed on February 14, 2024, that killed an Israeli soldier, the military added. The strike on a flat in a residential area of Sidon killed the official and his adult son and daughter, said a Palestinian official. A witness saw the fourth-floor flat still on fire after the strike, which caused heavy damage to the apartment block and neighbouring buildings and sparked panic in the densely populated neighbourhood. Lebanese state media had reported the 3:45 am (0045 GMT) strike on Sidon, saying at least three people were killed. ""A hostile drone raided a residential apartment... causing two successive explosions that led to a fire and extensive damage,"" the state-run National News Agency reported. Emergency workers rushed to the scene where they recovered ""the bodies of three martyrs,"" NNA said. The Lebanese prime minister called for ""maximum pressure on Israel to force it to halt these continual attacks which target various districts, many of them residential areas."" Israel struck south Beirut earlier this week, killing a Hezbollah Palestinian liaison officer in only the second raid on the capital since a November ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militant group. The Lebanese health ministry reported four dead in that strike, including a woman. Lebanese leaders condemned the attack, but Israel said it was in response to recent unclaimed rocket fire that Hezbollah insists it had no hand in. Hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah spiralled into all-out conflict last September, and the group remains a target of Israeli air strikes despite the November 27 ceasefire. Under the truce, Hezbollah is supposed to redeploy its forces north of the Litani River, about 30 kilometres from the Israeli border, and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure in the south.

RTHK,international,S Korea seizes two tons of cocaine in record bust,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798939-20250404.htm,"South Korea discovered and seized two tons of cocaine hidden aboard a Norwegian-flagged vessel, authorities said on Friday, marking the country's largest drug bust to date. The Korea Coast Guard said they had found ""two tons"" of what they suspect to be pure cocaine on a Norwegian-flagged vessel which had departed from Mexico and made stops in Ecuador, Panama, and China. The operation was launched after South Korean authorities received intelligence from US agencies – the FBI and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) – that the vessel was carrying hidden narcotics. The Korea Coast Guard and Korea Customs Service coordinated a large-scale search operation ""consisting of a joint search team of 90 officers... along with two drug-sniffing dog units,"" the Korea Coast Guard said. After the vessel docked at an east coast port in South Korea, the team immediately boarded the vessel and ""discovered a hidden compartment behind the ship's engine room."" The drugs were packed in 56 sacks, each holding some 30 to 40 kilogrammes of the drug, authorities said, bringing the total haul to around two tons. ""Preliminary field tests confirmed the substances as suspected cocaine,"" the Korea Coast Guard official said. ""The seizure is the largest in history, about five times bigger than the previous record, which was 404 kilogrammes of methamphetamine,"" said a Korea Customs Service official. The estimated street value is one trillion won (US$697 million), he added. Authorities have launched a joint investigation team to question the vessel's captain and crew about the origin and intended destination of the drugs, and the route used to transport them. Investigators also said they are looking into potential ties to international drug trafficking syndicates and will expand cooperation with the FBI and HSI. South Korea has long ranked among the countries with low drug use globally, thanks to its strict laws and strong social stigma.

RTHK,international,South Korea court upholds President Yoon's impeachment,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798910-20250404.htm,"South Korea's Constitutional Court on Friday decided to oust President Yoon Suk Yeol, upholding parliament's impeachment motion over his short-lived imposition of martial law last year that sparked the country's worst political crisis in decades. With Yoon's ouster, a presidential election is required to take place within 60 days, according to the country's constitution. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will continue to serve as acting president until the new president is inaugurated. The ruling caps months of political turmoil that have overshadowed efforts to deal with the new administration of U.S. President Donald Trump at a time of slowing growth. Separately, 64-year-old Yoon faces a criminal trial on insurrection charges. The embattled leader became the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested on January 15 but was released in March after a court cancelled his arrest warrant. The crisis was triggered by Yoon's December 3 declaration of martial law, which he has said was needed to root out ""anti-state"" elements and the opposition Democratic Party's alleged abuse of its parliamentary majority that he said was destroying the country. Yoon lifted the decree six hours later after lawmakers defied efforts by the security forces to seal off parliament and voted to reject it. Yoon has said he never intended to fully impose emergency military rule and tried to downplay the fallout, saying nobody was hurt. Months of protests have followed, and it remained unclear if the political chaos sparked by Yoon's martial law declaration will now be eased by the court ruling.

RTHK,international,Hungary to withdraw from ICC as Israeli leader visits,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798838-20250403.htm,"Hungary's government has decided to withdraw from the International Criminal Court, it said on Thursday, shortly after Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, sought under an ICC arrest warrant, arrived in the country for a state visit. Right-wing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban invited his Israeli counterpart to Budapest in November, a day after the ICC issued its arrest warrant over allegations of war crimes in Gaza, where Israel launched its offensive following an attack by Hamas-led fighters on southern Israel. Israel has rejected the accusations, which it says are politically motivated and fuelled by antisemitism. It says the ICC has lost all legitimacy by issuing the warrants against a democratically elected leader of a country exercising the right of self defence. As a founding member of the ICC, Hungary is theoretically obliged to arrest and hand over anyone subject to a warrant from the court but Orban made clear that Hungary would not respect the ruling, which he called ""brazen, cynical and completely unacceptable."" Hungary signed the ICC's founding document in 1999 and ratified it in 2001, but the law has not been promulgated. Gergely Gulyas, Orban's chief of staff, said in November that although Hungary ratified the Rome Statute of the ICC, it ""was never made part of Hungarian law,"" meaning that no measure of the court can be carried out within Hungary. On Thursday, Gulyas told state news agency MTI that the government would launch the withdrawal process later in the day. Orban had raised the prospect of Hungary's exit from the ICC after US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the court's prosecutor Karim Khan in February. ""It's time for Hungary to review what we're doing in an international organisation that is under US sanctions,"" Orban said on X in February. The bill on starting the year-long process of withdrawing from the ICC is likely to be approved by Hungary's parliament, which is dominated by Orban's Fidesz party. The Netherlands, which hosts the ICC, said that until withdrawal is complete, Hungary must still meet its duties. ""The full process to withdraw from the ICC takes about a year, during that time Hungary will have to fulfil all its obligations to the court,"" Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp told reporters on the sidelines of a Nato meeting in Brussels. Netanyahu has enjoyed strong support over the years from Hungary's Orban, an important ally who has been ready to block EU statements or actions critical of Israel in the past. ICC judges said when they issued the warrant that there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and his former defence chief were criminally responsible for acts including murder, persecution and starvation as a weapon of war as part of a ""widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza."" The Israeli campaign has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health authorities, and devastated the Gaza Strip. The Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, killed 1,200 people and saw more than 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. The ICC also issued an arrest warrant against a Hamas leader in November. His death was confirmed after the warrant was issued.

RTHK,international,Chinese rescuers fill vacuum US cuts leave in Myanmar,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798770-20250403.htm,"After a 7.7 magnitude earthquake shook Myanmar on Friday, killing more than 2,800 people, international rescuers rushed into the devastated Southeast Asian country. The most ubiquitous among them have been Chinese relief workers, whose blue and orange uniforms appear across videos circulating on social media.

America's chief geopolitical rival has so far pledged to deliver 100 million yuan worth of supplies. The first batch of aid, including tents, blankets and first aid kits arrived in Yangon on Monday, Beijing has said. The United States, which was until recently the world's top humanitarian donor, has offered a relatively modest US$2 million. Washington also said it would send a three-member assessment team, though their arrival has been delayed by problems obtaining visas from the military regime. In past years, when tsunamis, earthquakes and other disasters struck around the world, the United States had regularly and rapidly deployed skilled rescue workers to save lives. The American absence shows how President Donald Trump's moves to slash the size of the US government has hobbled its ability to act during disasters, three current and former US officials said. With Trump's blessings, billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has enacted huge funding cuts and contractor terminations across the federal bureaucracy in the name of targeting wasteful spending. Trump has also moved to fire nearly all US Agency for International Development staff, who oversee Washington's disaster response efforts overseas.

Trump's dramatic trade measures announced earlier this week have tightened scrutiny of Powell and how the Fed will react to free falling financial markets and concerns that a prolonged trade war would ramp up consumer prices and joblessness rates. ""The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,"" Powell told an event in Virginia., adding that it was ""too soon"" to consider changes to US monetary policy. Powell spoke just minutes after Trump posted on social media, urging him to cut interest rates immediately and accusing him of playing politics in his role running the independent US central bank. The larger-than-expected tariffs unveiled on Wednesday stack on top of earlier country-specific levies, meaning that China, for example, will now face a new levy totalling 54 percent. Other top trading partners will also see higher rates, with the European Union now facing a 20 percent tariff from April 9, and India looking at a 26 percent levy. The Trump administration has also targeted specific sectors of the economy, recently slapping a 25 percent tariff on automobiles not made in the United States. Powell said Friday that he expected the current uncertainty to decline in the coming months. Powell's comments suggest the Fed is in no rush to cut its benchmark lending rate from its current elevated level of between 4.25 and 4.50 percent, as it continues its struggle to bring inflation down to its long-term two percent target. In recent months, the Fed's progress in bringing inflation down to target has stalled, while growth has remained solid and the unemployment rate has hugged close to historic lows. Faced with this data, the Fed voted last month to extend its pause in rate cuts and signalled that it wanted to see how the new administration's policies would feed through to the economy before taking any action. Fed policymakers - now including Powell - have warned that tariffs could cause prices to rise, with the extent of the price increase likely determined by the rollout of the levies and how consumers and businesses respond. Ahead of Powell's speech on Friday, Donald Trump took to his Truth Social account to insist that his tariff policy would not change despite the market reaction and called on Powell to act. ""CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!"" wrote Trump, who first nominated Powell to run the Fed, before turning against him during his first term. Speaking Friday, Powell insisted he had no plans to step down as Fed chair before his term ends next year. ""I fully intend to serve all of my term,"" he said during the Virginia event.

Faced with this data, the Fed voted last month to extend its pause in rate cuts and signalled that it wanted to see how the new administration's policies would feed through to the economy before taking any action. Fed policymakers - now including Powell - have warned that tariffs could cause prices to rise, with the extent of the price increase likely determined by the rollout of the levies and how consumers and businesses respond. Ahead of Powell's speech on Friday, Donald Trump took to his Truth Social account to insist that his tariff policy would not change despite the market reaction and called on Powell to act. ""CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!"" wrote Trump, who first nominated Powell to run the Fed, before turning against him during his first term. Speaking Friday, Powell insisted he had no plans to step down as Fed chair before his term ends next year. ""I fully intend to serve all of my term,"" he said during the Virginia event.

RTHK,finance,Major Wall Street indices fall by over 5 percent,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798992-20250405.htm,"Wall Street stocks suffered another bruising sell-off on Friday as major indices slumped more than five percent following President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies. US equities spent the entire session in the red, shrugging off solid employment figures and fixating on China's quick retaliation against the US levies. The broad-based S&P 500 led the major indices lower, ending at 5,074.08, down 6.0 percent for the day and more than nine percent for the week. The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slumped 5.8 percent to 15,587.79, placing it in a bear market, defined as a 20 percent fall from a recent high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 5.5 percent to 38,314.86, its first close under 40,000 points since August. The losses increased somewhat following remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who warned of the risk of higher unemployment and higher inflation due to tariff increases he characterized as ""significantly larger than expected."" Earlier, government data showed the US economy added 228,000 jobs last month, much more than analysts anticipated. But markets focused on China's announcement that it was imposing 34 percent tariffs on US imports while also enacting export controls on seven rare earth elements. ""We've essentially got an escalating trade war,"" said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital. ""We're at the beginning of a global slowdown if these tariffs remain in place."" All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 fell while the Dow index was overwhelmingly a sea of red, with Apple falling 7.3 percent, Chevron 8.2 percent and Boeing 9.5 percent. But there were a few equities that rebounded. Nike and Lululemon Athletica rose three percent or more after Trump spoke optimistically about trade talks with Vietnam, from which both companies import apparel. Clothing importers had been among the most hard-hit sectors on Thursday. Homebuilders were another bright spot in light of falling mortgage rates as markets bet on easing monetary policy. Lennar rose 2.4 percent, while KB Home tacked on 3.5 percent.

RTHK,finance,Trump extends TikTok deadline to find buyer,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798987-20250405.htm,"US President Donald Trump on Friday extended the deadline for TikTok to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a ban in the United States, allowing 75 more days to find a solution. ""My administration has been working very hard on a deal to save TikTok, and we have made tremendous progress,"" Trump said on Truth Social, just hours before the deadline was to expire. ""A transaction requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days."" The hugely popular video-sharing app, which has well over 170 million American users, is under threat from a US law that passed overwhelmingly last year and orders TikTok to split from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, or get shut down in the United States. Trump has insisted his administration is near a deal to find a buyer for TikTok and keep it from shutting down that would involve multiple investors but has given few details. Motivated by national security fears and belief in Washington that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese government, the ban took effect on January 19, one day before Trump's inauguration. In the hours before that deadline, TikTok was temporarily shut down in the United States and disappeared from app stores, to the dismay of millions of users. But the Republican president quickly announced an initial 75-day delay, and TikTok subsequently restored service to users, returning to the Apple and Google app stores in February. The new 75-day delay pushes the deadline to June 19. The president added on Friday that he would ""continue working in good faith with China."" The president suggested TikTok could even be part of a broader deal with China to ease the stinging tariffs he imposed on Beijing as part of a worldwide blitz of levies. According to reports, the solution in the works would see existing US investors in ByteDance roll over their stakes into a new independent global TikTok company. Additional US investors, including Oracle and Blackstone, the private equity firm, would be brought on to reduce ByteDance's share. ABC News reported on Friday that Walmart was also in the mix. Uncertainty remains, particularly over what would happen to TikTok's valuable algorithm. ""TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand – it's simply not as powerful,"" said Forrester Principal Analyst Kelsey Chickering. Amazon has also reportedly made a last-minute bid to buy TikTok. Other proposals include an initiative called ""The People's Bid for TikTok"", launched by real estate and sports tycoon Frank McCourt's Project Liberty initiative. Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity recently expressed interest in buying TikTok, as did a joint venture involving YouTube mega-celebrity MrBeast and another bid from adult content platform OnlyFans.

RTHK,finance,Tariffs will rebound on US: economists,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798796-20250403.htm,"The latest tariffs imposed by the United States will add to the country's own economic pains, complicate already heightened global trade and geopolitical tensions, and result in a backlash from many nations, according to economists. They were responding to US President Donald Trump's imposition of steep tariffs on imports from many countries, including 34 percent on China, 20 percent on the European Union, 46 percent on Vietnam and a baseline tariff of 10 percent for a wide range of other nations. ""Generally speaking, I do think that the tariffs imposed on all countries are definitely more than people expected, especially in some regions, even in the European Union,"" Dickie Wong, executive director of research at Kingston Securities, said in an interview with RTHK. He said the higher levies could complicate the already heightened trade tensions between the United States and almost ""every single country"" in the world, while having a negative effect on global financial markets, which plunged significantly following Trump's announcements. Wong also noted that the across-the-board tariff spikes will add to the pressures on the US Federal Reserve as it tries to reduce interest rates in the short to long term, especially now that the personal consumption expenditures price index – the Fed's preferred inflation gauge – has already shown signs of edging up. For his part, Ben Emons, chief market strategist at Strategic Fortune Wealth, said that ""what we're seeing to be playing out is that the US gross domestic product will contract even further from here [on]. ""The markets have already been very efficient to drag down the benchmark S&P 500 index by 10 percent from the peak."" He added that such declines are only the tip of the iceberg of a broader impact as the tariffs are gradually implemented and, in turn, reflected in hard data in the coming months. Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said that ""we have already revised down our growth forecast for the US currently to 1.4 percent for this year, and it's likely going to be revised down further. ""This is quite incredible because heading into Donald Trump's presidency, the US economy was in a very strong state, but within the time span of just a couple of months, he's managed to potentially undo all of that. ""That story of a strong American growth is dissipating and that will carry consequences for the rest of the world given that it's not just China but the entire Asian region that really relies on US demand as a driver of their own economic growth."" The latest tariffs are going to sting China as the 34 percent comes on top of an existing 20 percent that, when it comes into effect on April 9, will be closer to Trump’s campaign pledge of a 60 percent rate. Also among Trump's moves was an order to end duty exemptions on low-value shipments from China under the ""de minimis"" rule starting on May 2, which analysts said brings the trade war ""closer to home"", as many middle-income American households rely on the exemptions as part of daily e-commerce purchases. Noting that China was always bearing the brunt of America's trade policies, Marro said that Beijing this time must act more pro-actively in its response to such trade shocks, such as by boosting domestic consumption to offset the trade impact. ""Chinese officials need to act pro-actively respond to these shocks, not just in terms of cushioning exporters and producers, but also over what this means for reviving domestic consumption, ensuring that they can reflate the economy in ways that are sustained,"" he said. ""Domestic demand is really going to be one of the only ways for China to offset this external demand shock,"" he added. Singapore-based investment veteran Olivier d'Assier noted that Trump's tariffs will draw a backlash from many nations, as the level of increase far exceeds expectations and may not serve as the negotiation tool that the American president may have been hoping for. ""[So] if you say 10 percent or 15 percent, it gets people's attention,"" said d'Assier. ""They [the nations] come to the table, they negotiate some kind of deals. ""But if you say 30 percent, 40 percent, 54 percent, this would be unacceptable to most of these trading partners, and they will retaliate. ""And they have means to retaliate. ""I don't think Trump realizes this, but there are options for people [nations] to stay and wait. ""And I think that's the reaction he's going to get on these trade tariffs from China, from the EU, from Canada, and others."" D'Assier added that [the nations] will say, 'well, since your economy is the one that's going to take the pain initially, we'll just wait and see how long you can take it'"".","Thu, 03 Apr 2025 16:25:18 +0800","The latest tariffs imposed by the United States will add to the country's own economic pains, complicate already heightened global trade and geopolitical tensions, and result in a backlash from many nations, according to economists.

Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said that ""we have already revised down our growth forecast for the US currently to 1.4 percent for this year, and it's likely going to be revised down further. ""This is quite incredible because heading into Donald Trump's presidency, the US economy was in a very strong state, but within the time span of just a couple of months, he's managed to potentially undo all of that. ""That story of a strong American growth is dissipating and that will carry consequences for the rest of the world given that it's not just China but the entire Asian region that really relies on US demand as a driver of their own economic growth."" The latest tariffs are going to sting China as the 34 percent comes on top of an existing 20 percent that, when it comes into effect on April 9, will be closer to Trump’s campaign pledge of a 60 percent rate. Also among Trump's moves was an order to end duty exemptions on low-value shipments from China under the ""de minimis"" rule starting on May 2, which analysts said brings the trade war ""closer to home"", as many middle-income American households rely on the exemptions as part of daily e-commerce purchases. Noting that China was always bearing the brunt of America's trade policies, Marro said that Beijing this time must act more pro-actively in its response to such trade shocks, such as by boosting domestic consumption to offset the trade impact. ""Chinese officials need to act pro-actively respond to these shocks, not just in terms of cushioning exporters and producers, but also over what this means for reviving domestic consumption, ensuring that they can reflate the economy in ways that are sustained,"" he said. ""Domestic demand is really going to be one of the only ways for China to offset this external demand shock,"" he added. Singapore-based investment veteran Olivier d'Assier noted that Trump's tariffs will draw a backlash from many nations, as the level of increase far exceeds expectations and may not serve as the negotiation tool that the American president may have been hoping for. ""[So] if you say 10 percent or 15 percent, it gets people's attention,"" said d'Assier. ""They [the nations] come to the table, they negotiate some kind of deals. ""But if you say 30 percent, 40 percent, 54 percent, this would be unacceptable to most of these trading partners, and they will retaliate. ""And they have means to retaliate. ""I don't think Trump realizes this, but there are options for people [nations] to stay and wait. ""And I think that's the reaction he's going to get on these trade tariffs from China, from the EU, from Canada, and others."" D'Assier added that [the nations] will say, 'well, since your economy is the one that's going to take the pain initially, we'll just wait and see how long you can take it'"".",2025-04-03 16:25:18

RTHK,finance,Tariffs target packages under US$800 from HK,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798734-20250403.htm,"US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that closes a trade exemption known as ""de minimis"" that has allowed low-value packages from mainland China and Hong Kong to enter the United States, free of duties. Trump signed the order, which takes effect on May 2, in the Rose Garden of the White House after announcing sweeping new tariffs on global trading partners. The White House said the move came after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick certified ""adequate systems are in place to collect tariff revenue"" on the shipments. It said imported goods from mainland China and Hong Kong sent outside the international postal network and valued at or under US$800 would now be subject to all applicable duties. Imported goods sent through the postal network and valued at or under US$800 would now be subject to a duty rate of either 30 percent of their value or US$25 per item, with that rate increasing to US$50 per item after June 1. Trump had signed an initial order on February 1 ending duty-free entry for the cheap Chinese goods, but later paused the order because of logistical issues complicating the inspection of millions of the low-value shipments. The number of shipments entering the US through the duty-free route has exploded in recent years, reaching nearly 1.4 billion packages last year. More than 90 percent of all packages coming into the US now enter via de minimis, and of those, about 60 percent come from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein. Trump's order affecting de minimis parcels was paused on February 7 because there had not been sufficient time to prepare, with packages stacking up at ports of entry. The White House said carriers transporting the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong postal items must ""report shipment details to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), maintain an international carrier bond to ensure duty payment, and remit duties to CBP on a set schedule."" It said CBP may require formal entry for any postal package instead of the specified duties. The White House said the commerce secretary would submit a report within 90 days assessing the order’s impact and considering whether to extend these rules to packages from Macau.

With just two wins in their last six league matches, Arsenal have tamely surrendered in the title race and are destined to go another year without their first English crown since 2004. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta had said the best preparation for his side's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Real Madrid would be to win at Goodison Park. But the Spaniard showed he had one eye on the visit of the European champions with his team selection. Bukayo Saka was forced to wait for his first start since December as the England international was left on the bench alongside Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Martinelli, Jurrien Timber and Thomas Partey. ""This is a very tough place to come, a team who is very physical and direct. If you don't deal with it, it's hard to get momentum. The start of the second half was very poor,"" Arteta said. Arsenal's weakened line-up struck first in the 34th minute when Raheem Sterling picked out Trossard and his low shot took Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford by surprise as it squirmed into the net. Everton were unable to stop Liverpool's march to the title in midweek when they lost 1-0 in the Merseyside derby at Anfield. David Moyes' men did their arch rivals another favour as they drew level in the 49th minute. Myles Lewis-Skelly fouled Jack Harrison and Ndiaye stroked home from the penalty spot four minutes into the second period to put Liverpool within touching distance of the title. At Villa Park, Unai Emery's side climbed into sixth as early goals from Morgan Rogers and Donyell Malen saw off third-placed Forest, who got one back through Jota Silva. Villa's seventh consecutive victory in all competitions was the ideal preparation for Wednesday's trip to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League quarter-final first leg. A top-five Premier League finish will almost certainly be enough for Villa to qualify for next season's Champions League. Villa sit below fifth-placed Manchester City on goal difference and within one point of Chelsea in fourth. Wolves effectively sealed their survival and left Ipswich on the brink of relegation with a 2-1 win at Portman Road. Vitor Pereira's side trailed to Liam Delap's 16th-minute goal as the striker swept in Dara O'Shea's knockdown. But Pablo Sarabia drilled into the bottom corner to haul Wolves level in the 72nd minute, before Jorgen Strand Larsen prodded home on 84 minutes for his fourth goal in his last three games. Fourth-bottom Wolves are 12 points clear of third-bottom Ipswich with just seven games left, leaving Kieran McKenna's side almost certain to return to the Championship after just one season. Wolves' victory also means bottom of the table Southampton will be relegated if they lose at Tottenham on Sunday. Crystal Palace beat Brighton 2-1 despite finishing with nine men in a bruising battle featuring three red cards at Selhurst Park. FA Cup semi-finalists Palace went ahead thanks to Jean-Philippe Mateta's third minute curler, before Danny Welbeck's close-range effort in the 31st minute dragged Brighton level. Daniel Munoz blasted Palace's winner in the 55th minute, but the Eagles had to dig deep for the win. Palace striker Eddie Nketiah was sent off for two bookings in the space of nine minutes, then team-mate Marc Guehi was dismissed for picking up a second yellow card in the 90th minute.

Verstappen clocked a blistering lap of 1min 26.983sec in his Red Bull, 0.012sec ahead of championship leader Norris, with McLaren's Oscar Piastri third. Verstappen set a new Suzuka track record with his final lap in Saturday's qualifying, pipping Norris right at the death. ""Each session we kept making little improvements, then the last lap was flat out,"" said Verstappen, who has won the Japanese GP for the last three years. ""In a Formula One car around here is insane. This is a proper highlight for us to be back on pole here."" It was Verstappen's first pole position of the season. The Dutchman is still looking for his first grand prix win of the new campaign. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was fourth ahead of Mercedes' George Russell, with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli sixth and RB's Isack Hadjar seventh. Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton was eighth, followed by Williams's Alex Albon and Haas's Oliver Bearman. Norris is looking for his second grand prix win of the season, after triumphing in the season opener in Australia. He finished second behind Piastri in China a fortnight ago in a dominant start to the campaign for McLaren. ""I'm happy, congrats to Max, he did a good job,"" said Norris. ""You have to credit something when it is a lap that good that he must have done. I got everything out of the car today, the gaps are tiny. ""Good but not enough."" Tsunoda was eliminated in Q2 in a disappointing first qualifying drive for Red Bull after being promoted in place of Liam Lawson last week. The Japanese driver finished one place behind Lawson, who returned to RB after just two races for Red Bull in a ruthless driver swap. Verstappen has not looked comfortable this week and he again complained to his team over the radio in Q1. ""I still have the same problem, the tyres are not gripping on the front,"" the Dutchman said. Alpine's Pierre Gasly, Williams's Carlos Sainz and Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso were eliminated in Q2 along with Lawson and Tsunoda. Sauber pair Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto, Haas's Esteban Ocon, Alpine's Jack Doohan and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll were all eliminated in Q1. Doohan's practice on Friday ended when he crashed heavily into a barrier and mechanics had to work through the night to repair his badly damaged car.

With Gretzky in attendance, the 39-year-old Russian delivered No. 894 6:32 into the third quarter to give his Washington Capitals a 4-3 lead over the Chicago Blackhawks in a game they would go on to win 5-3. Ovechkin tied Gretzky's monumental mark with a power-play goal, dropping to one knee and lifting his arms in celebration as the crowd at Capital One Arena roared. ""I'm sure everybody enjoyed this moment because it's something special,"" Ovechkin said in an in-arena interview immediately after the game. ""(To) do it at home, in front of our fans, family, friends, and obviously win here as well ... It's a huge honor."" Ovechkin also skated over and high-fived his son Sergei, with teammates coming onto the ice to congratulate him. ""It means a lot,"" Ovechkin said. ""Right now it's so emotional. You never thought, like, you can reach that milestone. ""Without all my teammates, all my partners, you guys,"" he said with a nod to fans, ""my family, my mom, my wife, you know? They support, they do everything what I need."" Needing three goals to break Gretzky's monumental mark coming into the contest, he had grabbed number 893 just 3:52 into the game. Set up at the bottom of the right faceoff circle, Ovechkin one-timed a pass from Dylan Strome past Blackhawks goaltender Spencer Knight. ""It was a good flat pass (from Strome) and I got lucky,"" Ovechkin said in a brief television interview during the first intermission. ""It hit the post and went in."" The goal gave Ovechkin his 14th 40-goal season, extending his own record. Gretzky was in attendance, and Ovechkin said after the first period that the presence of the Canadian great added to an electric atmosphere at Washington's Capital One Arena. ""Everybody's buzzing right now,"" he said. ""Wayne's here, so it's a special moment."" Fans were chanting for Ovechkin before the game started, and every time he was on the ice. A groan went up in the first period when a pass intended for Ovechkin was intercepted by a Chicago defender. Gretzky, sitting in a suite with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, also drew cheers from the crowd. The Blackhawks, trailing 4-3, pulled their goaltender, but after Ryan Leonard scored into the empty net to put the Caps up 5-3 Knight returned to his goal -- and took Ovechkin on. He stopped two attempts from the Russian for a record-breaking goal as the clock wound down, drawing boos from spectators for his trouble.

RTHK,sport,Van der Poel and Pogacar face off in Tour of Flanders,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1799008-20250405.htm,"Come rain or shine 750,000 fans are expected to turn out on Sunday for cycling's most revered one-day race, the Tour of Flanders, for a Tadej Pogacar and Mathieu van der Poel showdown. The all-rounder Pogacar won the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and world championships in 2024, while Van der Poel, who is 10 kilos heavier than the Slovenian, is the most powerful one-day racer, and has multiple mountain bike and cyclocross titles. Pogacar has also confirmed he will ride the Paris-Roubaix with its 54km of cobbles and no hills in next Sunday's big one. Van der Poel won both last season. Each has seven wins in the Monuments and last time the two went head-to-head Van der Poel came out on top at Milan - San Remo in March. ""Mathieu is one of the best sprinters in the peloton,"" said the effervescent Pogacar. ""Flanders is a very different race. But if there's a sprint, I'll do my best."" While Pogacar won here in 2023, Van der Poel is one of seven men to have won it three times and could become the first to win a fourth. In this epic 270km struggle through lush Flemish plains, Van der Poel's weight might be an advantage for the distance and the 18 cobbled sections. For the slighter Pogacar, there are 17 short, punchy hills where he can exercise his devastating kick. Belgian hopes would normally rest on Wout van Aert. He has struggled to find any form since a win at the Vuelta last year but Pogacar is not ruling him out. ""Wout seems pretty good to me. He's on the pace,"" Pogacar said. ""He'll be in there on Sunday."" Denmark's Mads Pedersen and Filippo Ganna of Ineos are two other on-form riders to watch out for. First staged in 1913 the Tour of Flanders was designed to reflect the stoicism of the Flemish. The winner is often a tough, tactically-minded rider ready to give every last drop for victory. Van der Poel won the 2020, 2022 and 2024 Flanders and has twice been runner-up, but after winning the Milan - San Remo in March he picked out Pogacar as favourite for this one. ""There are many more hills here for him to attack on. It'll be hard, but then it always is,"" said the 30-year-old Dutch phenomenon. After the 114km mark, there is a cobbled hill every 8km or so, constantly whittling down the field which will start with 25 teams of seven. Each hillside in the latter part of the race is turned into a giant makeshift party pub, with beer tents and food caravans before an after-party that goes on late into the night. Pogacar said of his 2023 win he could retire happy after soloing home thanks to a series of devastating attacks. He opted not to defend his title in 2024 to target an elusive Giro-Tour double last achieved by the late Marco Pantini in 1998. There are five ultra-long one-day bike races known as the Monuments, and the Tour of Flanders is considered the greatest because of the constant steep, narrow climbs coupled with crowds that even a 100 years ago began to tip over half a million. The other four Monuments are Milan-San Remo, which calls for patience, the mudfest of Paris-Roubaix with its perilous rough-hewn cobbles, Liege-Bastogne-Liege through the winding forested lanes of the Ardennes, and the Tour of Lombardy which is a climbers' classic. Shuttle buses and extra trains have been laid on throughout Flanders for what is regarded by many as an unofficial world championship.

RTHK,sport,Fernandez header powers Chelsea into fourth,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798934-20250404.htm,"Chelsea climbed to fourth place in the Premier League as Enzo Fernandez sealed a 1-0 win that piled pressure on beleaguered Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou on Thursday. Fernandez's thumping header early in the second half settled a bruising London derby at Stamford Bridge. Manchester City and Newcastle had both won on Wednesday to knock Chelsea from fourth down to sixth in the race to qualify for next season's Champions League. But Chelsea's response lifted them one point clear of fifth-placed City and two ahead of sixth-placed Newcastle. The top four are guaranteed to reach the Champions League, with fifth also likely to secure a place depending on the results of the English clubs left in European competitions this season. Chelsea, who have now lost just one of their past 13 league games against Tottenham, had been far from convincing recently, with boss Enzo Maresca criticised for his cautious tactics. Beaten 1-0 at Arsenal in their last game before the international break, Chelsea's players had a planned day off cancelled by Maresca due to a poor effort shown during an informal match against one of the club's youth sides. The Blues were more dynamic against Tottenham, but still lacked a cutting edge despite holding on for a fifth win in their last six games in all competitions. For Postecoglou, it was another dispiriting loss in a wretched season that could end with his sacking. Tottenham are without a victory in their last four league matches and have won only one of their last six games in all competitions. The north Londoners are languishing in 14th place after a 16th defeat from 30 league games. The last time they finished as low as 14th was in 2003-04, while their worst final position in the Premier League era was 15th in 1993-94. Tottenham fans have grown increasingly frustrated with their side's decline, staging a series of protests against chairman Daniel Levy. They turned on Postecoglou as well during the second half, chanting ""you don't know what you're doing"" at the Australian. Tottenham's last chance of ending their 17-year trophy drought and fulfilling Postecoglou's boast that he always wins a major prize in his second season lies in the Europa League, where they face Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-finals. Chelsea almost made the perfect start inside the first minute when Trevoh Chalobah's pass reached Nicolas Jackson, whose shot was saved by Guglielmo Vicario and hit Van de Ven before bouncing off the post. The Blues were on top in the opening minutes, and Malo Gusto's blast flashed just wide from the edge of the area. Vicario had to smother the ball on the goal-line after Fernandez tried to bundle home from Cole Palmer's deflected cross. Maresca had urged Jadon Sancho to provide more cutting edge amid mounting criticism of the winger's spluttering form during his loan from Manchester United. Sancho nearly rose to Maresca's challenge with a curling effort that Vicario brilliantly tipped over. Tottenham defender Cristian Romero pushed Levi Colwill to the ground in a clash that sparked a mass confrontation on the stroke of half-time. The row seemed to fire up Chelsea, and they finally made the breakthrough in the 50th minute. Palmer's cross picked out Fernandez, and the Argentine powered his header past Vicario from five yards. When Postecoglou sent on Brennan Johnson and Pape Sarr for Wilson Odobert and Lucas Bergvall, Tottenham fans taunted the Australian with derisive chants. For a few moments, it seemed Sarr had silenced Postecoglou's critics as he drilled home from long range in the 69th minute. But the goal was disallowed by VAR for Sarr's foul on Moises Caicedo, leaving Postecoglou shaking his head in frustration. Son Heung-min was inches away from rescuing Postecoglou in the 89th minute, only for Robert Sanchez to make a superb save from the forward's close-range shot.

Sinner received a three-month ban agreed with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in February after ""admitting ""partial responsibility"" for team mistakes. Ferrara, in his first public remarks on the scandal, laid the blame squarely at the door of Sinner's former physiotherapist Giacomo Naldi. Both of them have been laid off by the 23-year-old since the affair came to light. WADA came to an agreement with Sinner after accepting he was inadvertently contaminated with the banned substance clostebol by Naldi. Ferrara told Gazzetta dello Sport that he had used the spray himself for years after it was prescribed by a doctor for an illness. ""I was perfectly aware that it was banned so I always kept it safely stashed away in my wash bag,"" he said. ""I suggested Naldi use it for a cut which had not healed and was affecting his work. ""I was absolutely clear when I spoke to him about the nature of the product and it was imperative it never came into contact with Jannik. ""In effect I told him to use it only in my bathroom. ""Naldi did not deny he had been told, but he said he could not recall."" Ferrara said he did not know Naldi had been gloveless and also not washed his hands after using the spray when he treated Sinner, especially after ""the warnings he had given him"". ""With hindsight, it is easy to say I would not do things the same way,"" he said. ""Of course I am not proud of the behaviour of others."" ""I have suffered during this affair owing to the bad faith of some,"" added Ferrara, who has since joined the entourage of 2021 Wimbledon finalist Matteo Berrettini. Sinner's suspension ends on May 4, allowing him to return in time for the French Open, the second Grand Slam event of the year.

Tyler Herro scored 25 points to lead seven players to score in double figures for the Heat, who fought off a late Celtics surge to notch a sixth straight victory. Boston connected on just 37.2 percent of their shots in the first half in the face of stout Miami defense and Miami pushed their lead to 22 points early in the third quarter. The Celtics, led by 24 points from Jaylen Brown, cut the deficit to three, but Miami had pushed it back to 10 entering the fourth quarter. After the Celtics pulled within four early in the final frame the Heat relentlessly pulled away again. The victory solidified Miami's position in the Eastern Conference play-in while the Celtics fell five games behind the Cavaliers atop the conference with six games left in the regular-season. Donovan Mitchell scored 27 points and Jarrett Allen added 21 on impressive 10-of-11 shooting for the Cavs, who rallied from an early 15-point deficit to beat the Knicks 124-105 in Cleveland. The Knicks, third in the East, were again without top scoring threat Jalen Brunson, who missed his 14th game with a sprained ankle. Even without him the Knicks were on a three-game winning streak, but after leading by as many as 15 points on the way to a 60-53 halftime lead New York ran out of gas. New York's OG Anunoby made five of six from three-point range on the way to 19 first-half points, but scored just four in the second half.

""We can't relax, we have to keep believing and working, with humility and I'm sure good things will come,"" Torres said. ""If a final is already a huge motivation, imagine playing against your most direct rival."" Flick brought winger Raphinha back into Barcelona's starting line-up and the hosts tried to shut him down through fair means or foul. César Azpilicueta was booked for one tackle, surviving a VAR review for a potential red card, while Rodrigo de Paul was also cautioned for going in hard on the Brazilian. Teenage winger Lamine Yamal ran the show on the other flank for Barcelona, firing wide and teeing up Jules Kounde, who bypassed Robin Le Normand with some neat juggling before lashing over. The 17-year-old played in Torres for Barcelona's opener with a well-weighted pass, finished clinically by the former Manchester City forward, who has earned more minutes with his recent performances. Yamal mishit a shot himself from a good position in the box, while Atlético goalkeeper Juan Musso denied Raphinha at his near post. Simeone brought on Alexander Sorloth among three changes at the break, after he scored three goals in the three previous meetings between these sides this season. Perhaps convinced he would make it four in four, Sorloth fired narrowly wide early in the second half with Antoine Griezmann open and ready for a simple finish. At the other end, Raphinha forced another save from Musso but was himself guilty of not squaring for Fermín López. Sorloth rattled home what he thought for a few seconds was an equaliser, but he had strayed offside. With Atlético ascendant, Flick brought on top goalscorer Robert Lewandowski for Torres, but the Polish veteran struggled to get involved. With four minutes of stoppage time added on Atlético turned the screw, with Musso coming up for a late De Paul free-kick, but Barcelona held off the hosts to progress.

Teenage winger Lamine Yamal ran the show on the other flank for Barcelona, firing wide and teeing up Jules Kounde, who bypassed Robin Le Normand with some neat juggling before lashing over. The 17-year-old played in Torres for Barcelona's opener with a well-weighted pass, finished clinically by the former Manchester City forward, who has earned more minutes with his recent performances. Yamal mishit a shot himself from a good position in the box, while Atlético goalkeeper Juan Musso denied Raphinha at his near post. Simeone brought on Alexander Sorloth among three changes at the break, after he scored three goals in the three previous meetings between these sides this season. Perhaps convinced he would make it four in four, Sorloth fired narrowly wide early in the second half with Antoine Griezmann open and ready for a simple finish. At the other end, Raphinha forced another save from Musso but was himself guilty of not squaring for Fermín López. Sorloth rattled home what he thought for a few seconds was an equaliser, but he had strayed offside. With Atlético ascendant, Flick brought on top goalscorer Robert Lewandowski for Torres, but the Polish veteran struggled to get involved. With four minutes of stoppage time added on Atlético turned the screw, with Musso coming up for a late De Paul free-kick, but Barcelona held off the hosts to progress. (AFP)",2025-04-03 06:12:33
RTHK,sport,Stuttgart beat Leipzig to reach German Cup final,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798718-20250403.htm,"Stuttgart set up a German Cup final clash with third-division Arminia Bielefeld after a 3-1 win over RB Leipzig. Under the watchful eyes of Jurgen Klopp, the new head of global soccer for Leipzig's owners Red Bull, the visitors were outclassed by a strong Stuttgart side. Goals from Angelo Stiller, Nick Woltemade and Jamie Leweling took Stuttgart to victory, putting them on track for a first German Cup triumph since 1997. The victory continues Stuttgart's rise since former Leipzig youth-team coach Sebastian Hoeness took over in April 2023. ""We're going to Berlin,"" Hoeness said. ""Unbelievable. The lads are unbelievable, it's incredible. It's a dream to travel to Berlin."" ""We rewarded ourselves with goals at the right moment and when we needed to we defended with passion,"" he added. The coach ended his post-match interview early before sprinting across the field to have his picture taken with the rest of the squad in front of the club's ecstatic home fans. Hoeness has become one of the most sought-after coaches in Europe, having led Stuttgart from relegation candidates to runners-up last season, and now the German Cup final. The five-time German champions and three-time cup winners will be heavy favourites in Berlin in May, against a Bielefeld side who stunned holders Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday. Leipzig, winners of two of the past three German Cups, had a chaotic lead-up to the match. On Sunday, the Saxons fired coach Marco Rose, who led them to the trophy two seasons ago, replacing him with interim boss Zsolt Low. Klopp, a close friend of Rose who brought him to the club while coaching Mainz in 2002 but who signed off on Sunday's decision, was spotted watching on from the stands on Wednesday. Stiller put the hosts on track five minutes in, smacking home an unstoppable volley from outside the box to give Stuttgart the lead. Leipzig were stunned but took control soon after. Visiting striker Lois Openda was kept at bay despite three clear chances between the 15 and 35-minute marks. Woltemade doubled Stuttgart's lead 12 minutes into the second half, sliding the ball under the goalkeeper after a clever one-two with Ermedin Demirovic. Leipzig hit back almost immediately when Sesko hammered in with 62 minutes gone after beating the offside trap. The visitors were in the ascendancy and an equaliser looked likely until Woltemade headed goalwards from a Stiller cross, with the ball bouncing to Leweling who tapped in from two yards out. Three-time winners Stuttgart have not qualified for the final since 2013, when they lost to a treble-bound Bayern, and last won in 1997. Founded in 2009 and promoted to the top flight for the first time in 2016, Leipzig had previously won four from four German Cup semi-finals.

RTHK,sport,Liverpool beat Everton as title looms; City cruise,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798717-20250403.htm,"Liverpool moved closer to the Premier League title with a 1-0 win in the Merseyside derby against Everton, while Manchester City beat Leicester 2-0 to bolster their bid to reach the Champions League. With just eight games left, Liverpool sit 12 points clear of second-placed Arsenal, who beat Fulham 2-1 on Tuesday. Arne Slot's side had lost their previous two games in the League Cup final against Newcastle and the Champions League last 16 against Paris Saint-Germain. But they got back on track in their march towards a record-equalling 20th English title and first since 2020 in Slot's maiden season in charge. Having gone over two months without a goal, Diogo Jota was Liverpool's hero as he ended his drought in the 57th minute, slotting home from Luis Díaz's flick. It was an especially sweet win for Liverpool after their stormy 2-2 draw at Everton in February, which featured a last-gasp equaliser for David Moyes' team. At the Etihad Stadium, City coped just fine without Norway striker Erling Haaland, who will be sidelined for up to seven weeks after suffering an ankle injury in Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final win at Bournemouth. Pep Guardiola's men took just two minutes to go in front against second-bottom Leicester, who have lost seven successive league games. Jeremy Doku and Savinho combined to carve open the Leicester defence before Jack Grealish slotted home from close range for his first league goal since December 2023. Grealish's long-awaited goal was missed by hundreds of City fans, who stayed outside the stadium for the first nine minutes in protest at the club's deal with a third-party ticket resale company. The protestors did get to see City double their advantage in the 29th minute as Egypt forward Omar Marmoush lashed home after Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen made a hash of dealing with Ruben Dias's pass. City are up to fourth place, one point ahead of fifth-placed Newcastle and two in front of sixth-placed Chelsea, who face Tottenham in their game in hand on Thursday. The top four qualify for the Champions League automatically, while fifth place is likely to also provide a berth in Europe's elite club competition. Newcastle beat Brentford 2-1 to maintain the party mood after the prolonged celebrations of their first major trophy for 56 years. Eddie Howe's side were back in action for the first time since beating Liverpool in the League Cup final. Alexander Isak met Jacob Murphy's cross with a typically predatory strike in first-half stoppage time at St James' Park. Brentford levelled through Bryan Mbeumo's 66th-minute penalty after Newcastle keeper Nick Pope tripped Yoane Wissa. But Sandro Tonali lashed home from Harvey Barnes' assist in the 74th minute. Aston Villa also remain in the hunt for a Champions League place after winning 3-0 at Brighton. Marcus Rashford struck in the 51st minute, accelerating onto Morgan Rogers' pass for his third goal in his last two games. Marco Asensio killed off Brighton in the 78th minute and Donyell Malen netted in added time to lift Villa into seventh place, two points behind Newcastle.

RTHK,sport,Curry drops 52 points in Warriors win over Grizzlies,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798584-20250402.htm,"Stephen Curry scored 52 points and Draymond Green added a triple-double as the Golden State Warriors clinched a crucial 134-125 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies. Curry, the NBA's all-time leader in three-point shooting, once again demonstrated his long-range prowess, draining 12-of-20 attempts from outside the arc at Memphis's FedExForum. The 37-year-old's dazzling shooting performance helped the Warriors vault over the Grizzlies into fifth place in the Western Conference standings, edging them closer to an automatic playoff berth. The Warriors improved to 44-31 while the Grizzlies dropped to sixth place with a 44-32 record. The top six finishers in the West qualify automatically for the postseason. Curry's masterpiece – his second 50-point game of the season and the 15th of his career – was backed by a triple from defensive linchpin Green and 27 points from Jimmy Butler. Green finished with 13 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists. Warriors coach Steve Kerr lavished praise on Curry's virtuoso display that has left Golden State firmly on course for the playoffs. ""The guy's 37 years old, it's incredible,"" Kerr said. ""Fifty-two points with people draped all over him all game long. The conditioning, the skill, the audacity, the belief, it's incredible to watch Steph at work. ""I can't believe he's still doing this at this age. But he's put the work in and he's still got it."" Grizzlies interim coach Tuomas Iisalo, who took over the team last week following the shock dismissal of Taylor Jenkins, was similarly effusive of Curry's performance. ""It's a sight to behold how he operates,"" Iisalo said, revealing that the team had been helpless to stop a first-quarter onslaught from Curry that included 19 points. ""In the first quarter we had a specific strategy that we do not want him to get three-point shots – and he found a way to get going anyway. It's very hard to stop a player of that caliber,"" he added. ""Once he gets into that zone, it's very difficult to get him,"" he continued. ""I mean, we're talking about the best movement shooter of all time."" Memphis, who trailed by as many as 17 points in the first quarter, were left ruing their inability to sustain a second-half rally which saw them open up a four-point lead with just under four minutes remaining. Ja Morant led the Grizzlies' scoring with 36 points while Jaren Jackson Jr. added 22. ""Everybody's hurting in that locker room right now,"" Iisalo said. ""It really hurts when you put everything on the line and you come up a little short. But that's life, that's sports."" Elsewhere, Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 37 points as the Milwaukee Bucks snapped a four-game losing streak with a 133-123 victory over the Phoenix Suns. Devin Booker scored 39 points for Phoenix but it was not enough to prevent the Suns from falling to a fourth consecutive defeat – a late-season mini-slump that has imperiled their playoff hopes. The Suns are now in 11th place in the West with a 35-41 record, trailing the 10th-placed Sacramento Kings (36-39). Teams ranked 7th to 10th in the conference standings advance to a four-team play-in tournament that determines the final two playoff tickets. Meanwhile, the Indiana Pacers became the latest team to clinch their playoff place after the Atlanta Hawks slumped to a 127-113 home defeat to the Portland Trail Blazers. The result ensured that the Pacers, fourth in the Eastern Conference with a 44-31 record, are guaranteed a top-six finish.

Xabi Alonso's side were heavily favoured to reach their second successive final but were outclassed from start to finish by their underdog opponents. Jonathan Tah's 17th-minute goal was cancelled out by a Marius Woerl strike for the hosts three minutes later. Maximilian Grosser's goal in first-half stoppage time would prove the difference for Bielefeld, who have now beaten four top-division opponents on their way to the final. Bielefeld, who have never made a German Cup final, became just the fourth third-division team to reach the showpiece event. Should Bielefeld win in Berlin in May – they will face either RB Leipzig or Stuttgart – the club will be rewarded with a Europa League spot next season. ""We didn't need luck at all because we were on the front foot the whole time,"" home coach Michel Kniat said. Kniat said he ""normally wouldn't have a drink with the players, but tonight I'll make an exception"", adding that ""nobody will go to sleep in this city tonight"". Leverkusen's Robert Andrich said it was ""by far our worst game of the season"" and added that ""Bielefeld deserved the win tonight, which means we did plenty of things wrong"". Leverkusen coach Alonso came into the game having never lost in 10 matches in the competition and needed just one more victory to beat Louis van Gaal's all-time record set as Bayern Munich manager. Everything seemed to go according to plan when Leverkusen took the lead after 17 minutes, Tah tapping in unmarked at the far post. The hosts hit back almost immediately however, Woerl taking advantage of a sloppy clearance attempt by Piero Hincapie to curl the ball home. As the half wore on, Leverkusen were unable to make their possession count, with Bielefeld fast and threatening on the counter. The hosts once again caught Leverkusen napping to take the lead moments before halftime, Grosser hammering in a Louis Oppie free kick from close range. Bielefeld continued to out-energise their opponents, fighting in the duels and giving Leverkusen few chances to drag themselves back into the game. Patrick Schick, so often Leverkusen's late hero over the past two seasons, had a chance to level the scores while unmarked after 81 minutes but hit a header against the post. This year's German Cup is one of the more open in recent memory, with recent champions Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Eintracht Frankfurt all suffering early eliminations from the competition.

RTHK,sport,Real Madrid hold Real Sociedad in eight-goal thriller,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1798540-20250402.htm,"Real Madrid edged into the Copa del Rey final with a thrilling 4-4 draw against Real Sociedad after extra-time, securing a 5-4 aggregate semi-final victory. Antonio Rudiger decided the pulsating tie with a header in the 115th minute, with Madrid to face Barcelona or Atletico Madrid in the final. Real Sociedad, trailing 1-0 from the first leg, took the lead through Ander Barrenetxea, but Endrick's fine chip pulled the 20-time winners level. A David Alaba own goal and Mikel Oyarzabal's deflected effort helped La Real open up a lead on the Spanish champions but Madrid battled back with goals from Jude Bellingham and Aurelien Tchouameni. Oyarzabal grabbed his second in stoppage time to force extra-time but his side could not hold off Madrid until penalties, with Rudiger's header the final word. ""I'm very happy because it was a really hard game with many comebacks and in the end my goal,"" Rudiger said. ""For me (the goal) was easy, (I made a) good movement, the corner was very good and because of that we're in the final,"" he added. ""It's a hard season but we're in another final and we will win it."" Ancelotti brought Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo Goes back into his starting lineup, leaving Kylian Mbappé on the bench to rest, with Endrick taking his place in an all-Brazilian attack. The 18-year-old wonderkid striker who netted the only goal in the first leg, was active in the opening phases, sending a dangerous overhead kick narrowly wide of Álex Remiro's far post. Bellingham also threatened for the hosts but it was Real Sociedad who took the lead. Barrenetxea broke in behind Lucas Vázquez to reach Pablo Marin's flick-on and drilled a low finish home to put the Basques level in the tie. Real Madrid soon found their equaliser. Vinicius played a sensational through ball down the left flank with the outside of his foot, sending Endrick in on goal. The youngster, top scorer in the Copa del Rey, produced a gorgeous lobbed finish over Romero for his fifth in the competition. Real Sociedad appealed for a penalty before the break when Takefusa Kubo went down in the box after being held by Vinicius, but the referee did not concur. Ancelotti brought on Mbappé for Endrick, looking for a goal to shut the tie down for good. However, it was the visitors who were creating the better chances. Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin made a superb save to deny Martin Zubimendi and Oyarzabal wastefully fired the rebound wide. Real Sociedad moved ahead on the night when Alaba deflected Marin's cross through Lunin's legs and into his own net after 72 minutes. The Austrian defender, who returned from a long-term injury in January, was also involved in Real Sociedad's third, deflecting Oyarzabal's shot past Lunin. It sparked Madrid in to action, with Vinicius turning his marker brilliantly, driving forward and crossing for Bellingham to strike in the 82nd minute. Four minutes later and Los Blancos pulled level on the night with Tchouameni's header badly fumbled by Remiro into his own net. Just when it seemed Real Sociedad were out they managed to force extra-time, with Oyarzabal heading home Sergio Gómez's free-kick in the 93rd minute. Remiro saved well from Bellingham before the end of the regulation 90 minutes, with the pace slower, inevitably, as the game restarted. Real Sociedad's Jon Olagasti was booked for hacking down Vinicius as he threatened to escape on the left, with the visitors working hard to hold off the European champions. With five minutes remaining Rudiger sent Madrid through to the final with a fine header from Arda Guler's corner past the helpless Remiro. On Wednesday Atletico Madrid host Barcelona in the second leg of the other semi-final, with the teams level at 4-4 on aggregate.

Real Sociedad appealed for a penalty before the break when Takefusa Kubo went down in the box after being held by Vinicius, but the referee did not concur. Ancelotti brought on Mbappé for Endrick, looking for a goal to shut the tie down for good. However, it was the visitors who were creating the better chances. Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin made a superb save to deny Martin Zubimendi and Oyarzabal wastefully fired the rebound wide. Real Sociedad moved ahead on the night when Alaba deflected Marin's cross through Lunin's legs and into his own net after 72 minutes. The Austrian defender, who returned from a long-term injury in January, was also involved in Real Sociedad's third, deflecting Oyarzabal's shot past Lunin. It sparked Madrid in to action, with Vinicius turning his marker brilliantly, driving forward and crossing for Bellingham to strike in the 82nd minute. Four minutes later and Los Blancos pulled level on the night with Tchouameni's header badly fumbled by Remiro into his own net. Just when it seemed Real Sociedad were out they managed to force extra-time, with Oyarzabal heading home Sergio Gómez's free-kick in the 93rd minute. Remiro saved well from Bellingham before the end of the regulation 90 minutes, with the pace slower, inevitably, as the game restarted. Real Sociedad's Jon Olagasti was booked for hacking down Vinicius as he threatened to escape on the left, with the visitors working hard to hold off the European champions. With five minutes remaining Rudiger sent Madrid through to the final with a fine header from Arda Guler's corner past the helpless Remiro. On Wednesday Atletico Madrid host Barcelona in the second leg of the other semi-final, with the teams level at 4-4 on aggregate. (AFP)",2025-04-02 06:27:41
