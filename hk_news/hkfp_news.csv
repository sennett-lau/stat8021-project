HKFP,509561,"Explainer: CK Hutchison’s Panama ports deal, Beijing’s reaction and the impact on geopolitics",https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/05/explainer-ck-hutchisons-panama-ports-deal-beijings-reaction-and-the-impact-on-geopolitics/,2025-04-05T09:30:00,,"Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings has made headlines in recent weeks since it announced in early March that it would sell over 40 of its ports to an American-led consortium. Two of the ports are located at the Panama Canal, a strategic waterway key to international trade that US President Donald Trump claims is controlled by China and which America should “take back.” Beijing then criticised CK Hutchison, claiming it had “betrayed” China. As the firm’s shares plummeted, the Chinese market regulator said that it would review the deal. Media reports then said that the conglomerate would not be going ahead with the transaction. The deal was expected to be signed on Wednesday, but the date came and went without any updates. Here’s what to know about the controversial ports deal, how China has reacted, and the geopolitical implications amid a deepening US-China trade war. CK Hutchison, partly owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, said on March 4 that it had entered into a US$22.8 billion deal to sell 45 ports to a consortium comprising US-based asset management firm BlackRock and global port operator Terminal Investment Limited, headquartered in Geneva. According to the latest company brochure, Hutchison Ports – a division of CK Hutchison – operates 53 ports across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Americas. In the announcement, CK Hutchison said the deal did not include the sale of its operations in mainland China and Hong Kong, where it has a total of 10 ports. See also: What are Hong Kong’s links to the Panama Canal, and does China really control the waterway as Trump claims? The company said that the transaction was “purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports.” Media reports have highlighted the sale of CK Hutchison’s two ports at the Panama Canal – the Balboa and Cristobal ports, on either side of the Central American country’s waterway. The Panama Canal ports are not among the world’s 15 busiest ports. Ports in mainland China dominate the top spots, while Hong Kong is ranked 11th. However, the 82-kilometre Panama Canal is a primary route for trade as it is the main connection between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Over 40 per cent of US container traffic is said to travel through the canal every year. The Panama Canal was constructed and operated in the early 1900s by the United States, which had – and still has – considerable influence in Panama. It was given to Panama in 1999 and has been under the control of the Panama government since. CK Hutchison’s deal announcement comes amid a deepening trade war between the US and China. The Panama Canal has been a major talking point in US President Donald Trump’s foreign policy rhetoric, mentioned in his inauguration speech in January. At the time, he said: “China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” Trump also refused to rule out a military invasion of Panama to regain control, prompting the Central American nation to lodge a complaint with the United Nations. The Panama government has denied Trump’s accusation that China exercises control of the waterway. But Chinese companies do have a presence there, and Beijing has also made investments in the canal and the country’s infrastructure. Panama was also the first Latin American country to join China’s Belt and Road Initiative, although it withdrew in February amid Trump’s assertions of China’s control of the nation. Beijing has criticised CK Hutchison’s deal, suggesting that the Hong Kong conglomerate was caving in to the US at the expense of China. China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said on Chinese social media platform Weibo on March 28 that it would review the deal to “protect fair market competition and public interest.” Days later, on Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said: “Let me stress again that China firmly opposes using economic coercion and bullying to harm other countries’ legitimate rights and interests.” It was the Chinese state-backed newspaper Ta Kung Pao that fired the opening salvo of the attacks. Since CK Hutchison’s sale announcement, the Hong Kong-based paper has published at least seven scathing commentaries about the deal. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the Hong Kong Liaison Office, both top Chinese bodies in the city, reposted some of the op-eds – including one on March 13, which called the sale an act of “spineless grovelling” that neglected national interests and “betrayed and sold out all Chinese people.” One of Ta Kung Pao’s latest opinion pieces, published on Tuesday, said CK Hutchison should have “the most basic sense of morality and righteousness to defend [China’s] interests.” Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee also chimed in. He told reporters in mid-March: “We oppose the abusive use of coercion, of bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations.” He added that “any transaction must comply with legal and regulatory requirements.” Last Friday, the same day China announced a probe into the deal, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters that she was aware of China’s comments. “It’s also no surprise that the CCP is upset at this acquisition, which will reduce their control over the Panama Canal area,” Bruce said. “We are also glad to see US investors acquire a controlling stake in the Panama Ports Company, which owns and operates the ports at Balboa and Cristóbal at either end of the Panama Canal.” Provides context or background, definition and detail on a specific topic.

HKFP,509669,In Pictures: Hundreds of trees burned down on Lantau as environmentalists urge increased wildfire awareness,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/04/in-pictures-hundreds-of-trees-burned-down-on-lantau-as-environmentalists-urge-increased-wildfire-awareness/,2025-04-04T09:00:00,,"A wildfire that broke out on Lantau Island’s Mui Wo nearly two weeks ago burned down hundreds of trees, many of them planted by horticulturist Paul Melsom over the past two decades. “It’s painful to walk amongst all the ashes. Trees you’ve been nurturing for a long time just reduced to nothing,” Melsom told HKFP. He had started planting trees in 2002 as part of a reforestation project in Mui Wo, on the eastern part of outlying Lantau Island. The blaze on March 23 destroyed many trees aged 15 to 20 years old in an area that was planted with rich vegetation, he said. Jenny Quinton – also a dedicated tree planter and the founder of Ark Eden, a green education non-profit in Mui Wo – told HKFP that she feared another wildfire could occur during Ching Ming Festival, also known as Tomb-Sweeping Day, on Friday. It is the day when people visit their ancestors’ graves, usually in the countryside, bringing food offerings and burning incense, candles, joss paper, and other paper goods. The fire on March 23 occurred near a cemetery. “Ching Ming is the most dangerous time because it goes on [for] a long time,” Quinton said, adding that people tend to visit family graves in different parts of Hong Kong for approximately six weeks before and after the day of the ancestral festival. Among the over 30 hill fires reported on Tomb-Sweeping Day last year was a blaze on an islet off Lamma Island, which trapped 27 people, according to local media reports. They were eventually rescued by firefighters. Incidents often occur when a fire danger warning is in force, meaning the weather poses a high risk of fire. But people also play a major role in wildfires, Melsom said. “All fires in Hong Kong are made by humans. No fires are made by nature… by thunder or lightning,” he said. “The majority of people are very good, but it takes just that one person to destroy a large area,” Melsom added. The Mui Wo fire raged through the hillside for at least a couple of hours. The Fire Services Department (FSD) said it received a report of a fire in Mui Wo, at 1.24pm on March 23, and firefighters arrived on the scene at 2pm. A helicopter from the Government Flying Service arrived at 2.24pm and dumped water. The fire was put out at 3.17pm, according to the FSD. At the time, the red fire danger warning was in force, indicating that the risk of a hill fire was extreme. The FSD told HKFP that the fire torched an estimated 300 square metres of land. HKFP visited the site on Monday, eight days after the fire. From afar, a large part of a slope looked brown and charred. Up close, it was barren and covered in ash. Melsom said it was fortunate that the fire was contained on one slope of a mountain, thanks to the efforts of the firefighters and the Government Flying Service. But it still caused more losses than any previous fires in the area, he said, partly because the blaze happened in a large “closed canopy forest,” where tree crowns touched one another and a fire could easily spread. He added that the area was home to 85 species of trees, all native to Hong Kong. “It’s difficult to determine [the losses],” Melsom said, adding that most trees in the affected area would die. While some trees may survive and grow back, they are still severely damaged, he added. “It’s one of my worst losses.” It was unclear what started the fire last month in Mui Wo. However, authorities say that most hill fires in Hong Kong’s countryside are caused by “human negligence.” The Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department (AFCD), which oversees Hong Kong’s country parks, regularly issues statements urging residents who go tomb sweeping to prevent causing a fire accidentally, advising them to burn paper offerings inside a container. It is an offence to burn offerings without taking steps to prevent wildfires in the countryside in Hong Kong. The maximum penalty is a fine of HK$25,000 and one year behind bars. Separately, people using fire outside designated places in country parks could also be fined up to HK$5,000 and jailed for one year. In an emailed reply on Thursday, the AFCD told HKFP that there were 81 prosecutions relating to two offences between 2022 and 2024, among which 79 led to convictions. Five more cases remain under investigation. Quinton called for a stronger presence of police and AFCD officers during the festival, saying it could deter people from using fire recklessly when performing ancestral rites at family graves. The presence of officers “sends a reminder” to people, who will behave more carefully when supervised, Melsom said. The AFCD said authorities will step up patrols in country parks and remind grave sweepers to avoid causing wildfire. Officers will take immediate legal action if an offence is suspected. But the public needs to be constantly reminded about the hazards of a wildfire, Quinton said, as prosecutions are often hampered by difficulties in collecting evidence. She noticed that wildfire awareness had slipped in recent years and hoped people would pay more attention to the issue. While “you respect traditions… you have to still behave carefully,” she said. She pointed to the Pat Sin Leng blaze in 1996, one of the deadliest wildfires in Hong Kong’s history, which killed five and injured 13, many of them student hikers. Authorities believe that the fire was caused by students smoking. “We don’t want something like that again, because you could die being caught in a fire of big trees,” Quinton said.

HKFP,509968,Hong Kong records 365 new HIV cases in 2024 – a decline for 9th consecutive year,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/03/hong-kong-records-365-new-hiv-cases-in-2024-a-decline-for-9th-consecutive-year/,2025-04-03T19:09:38,,"Hong Kong recorded 365 new HIV cases in 2024, with the youngest infected individual aged 14, health authorities have said. The Department of Health announced on Thursday that the city saw a decline in the number of new HIV infections for the ninth consecutive year. In 2024, health authorities received reports of new HIV cases from 297 males and 68 females aged between 14 and 89. A total of 312 people reported they were infected through sexual contact, with 216 cases involving homosexual or bisexual contact and the remaining 96 cases through heterosexual contact. The newly recorded cases last year put the city’s HIV infection toll since 1984 at 12,403, said Bonnie Wong, consultant for the Special Preventive Programme at the Centre for Health Protection’s Public Health Services Branch. “The prevalence of HIV infection among the general public in Hong Kong remained at 0.1 per cent, well below the global average, demonstrating the effectiveness of AIDS control and prevention in Hong Kong,” Wong said. On Thursday, the Department of Health said it recorded 74 new AIDS cases involving 63 males and 11 females. The figure put the cumulative total of confirmed AIDS cases in the city since 1985 at 2,557. The proportion of late diagnoses among the new HIV infections stood at around 40 to 50 per cent, the health department said. It warned that late diagnoses could lead to a greater risk of “opportunistic infections” and malignancies, which could result in a higher mortality rate. Individuals with late diagnoses may also contribute to an increased risk of HIV transmission in the community due to their “unsuppressed viral load,” the department said. A recent public health surveillance survey conducted by the Department of Health found that 55 per cent of female sex workers in Hong Kong had their last HIV test in the preceding year. The figure marked an increase from 37 per cent reported in a similar survey conducted in 2022. Ninety-nine per cent of the female sex workers surveyed said that they used condoms when having sex with non-regular clients. But the use of condoms with regular customers was “less consistent” among some respondents. The findings showed a need to step up efforts on promoting condom use, Wong said.

HKFP,510044,"US soybeans, energy: Who is hit by China’s tariff retaliation?",https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/05/us-soybeans-energy-who-is-hit-by-chinas-tariff-retaliation/,2025-04-05T16:07:21,,"US agricultural exports, fuels and manufactured goods are set to take a hit from China’s blanket retaliation against President Donald Trump’s sharp tariffs, with both sets of measures due to take effect next week. After Trump announced a 34-percent new tariff on imports of Chinese goods — taking the added rate imposed this year to 54 percent — Beijing said it would slap an equivalent across-the-board tariff on US goods, among other countermeasures. China used to target specific industries in a “mirror response” to US export restrictions, said Emily Benson of consulting firm Minerva Technology Policy Advisors. But its broader plan unveiled Friday marks a “pretty significant warning shot” to the Trump administration to hold off further measures, she told AFP. What is the state of US-China trade, and what US sectors stand to be impacted? The United States exported $144.6 billion in goods to China in 2024, much less than the $439.7 billion it imported, Commerce Department data shows. Among its exports, key sectors include electrical and electronic equipment and various fuels, alongside oilseed and grains. But China likely has more confidence to retaliate this time compared with Trump’s first presidency, when he engaged in a tit-for-tat tariff war with Beijing. “While the US is still obviously a very important market, fewer firms are now existentially dependent on US suppliers,” said Lynn Song, ING chief economist for Greater China. She added that Beijing has also made efforts towards technological self-sufficiency. “US farmers will bear a heavy burden,” said Asia Society Policy Institute vice president Wendy Cutler. Their agricultural exports to China could “become too expensive to be competitive” with Beijing’s added tariffs, she told AFP. Soybeans, oilseeds and certain grains were a key US export to China, amounting to $13.4 billion last year, US trade data showed. “China bought 52 percent of our (soybean) exports in 2024,” said American Soybean Association chief economist Scott Gerlt. Given the size of its purchases, China cannot easily be replaced, he told AFP. Soybean prices plunged on Friday’s news. China also imported $14.7 billion of various fuels and oils from the United States last year. Tariffs could impact the oil and gas industry in states like Texas, which alongside Louisiana saw such exports to China surge in 2023, said a US-China Business Council report. And the US exported some $15.3 billion in electrical machinery to China last year, official trade data showed. But semiconductor shipments have faltered on expanding US export controls on advanced tech. Besides tariffs, China has restricted exports of rare earth elements and taken action against US firms — including drone companies and those in the defense and aerospace sectors. “China controls about 69 percent of rare earth element mining. They also control about 90 percent of refining,” said Benson of Minerva Technology Policy Advisors. “That’s going to probably be a chokepoint moving forward,” she added. This could affect semiconductor manufacturing, magnets, optics and lasers. “Some of these are targeted, of course, at chips,” she said. With Washington and Beijing turning to a growing range of tools in their conflict, Benson warned that the US “is relatively exposed to these Chinese controls” without an industrial policy response providing “a major cash infusion to scale up domestic production.” Washington, United States Produced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic standards.

In a report on Friday, the news wire said that the ban was put into effect by departing US ambassador Nicholas Burns in January before he left China. Family members and contractors with security clearance are included in the ban. “Non-fraternisation” policies were common during the Cold War, with a limited version – affecting relationships with Chinese guards and support staff – put into place last summer in China. The policy was broadened days ahead of US President Donald Trump’s inauguration. The policy affects the US embassy in Beijing and its consulates in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenyang, according to the AP. It was not publicly announced, though it was communicated to personnel across China in January. Those with pre-existing relationships with Chinese citizens may reportedly apply for exemptions, though – if denied – they must leave their position or end the relationship. Violators must leave China immediately. The State Department told the AP that it does not comment on internal matters.

HKFP,509878,"Social worker Jackie Chen a kind person who helps others in need, lawyer says ahead of rioting jail term",https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/03/social-worker-jackie-chen-a-kind-person-who-helps-others-in-need-lawyer-says-ahead-of-rioting-jail-term/,2025-04-03T15:33:23,,"Hong Kong social worker Jackie Chen is a kind person who is happy to help others in need, her lawyer has said as a judge prepares to hand down a jail term for her riot conviction linked to a protest in 2019. Chen, 48, appeared at the District Court on Thursday morning. She was found guilty last month of rioting during a protest in 2019, after the judge sided with the prosecution and said she “stood on the same side as the protesters.” The social worker’s conviction came more than five years after the protest on August 31, 2019. Chen was initially cleared of rioting midway through her trial in September 2020, but the government successfully appealed the acquittal. Representing Chen, barrister Hector Pun pleaded to the court for a lighter sentence for his client. He said during mitigation that Chen was a person of good character who, besides helping people during her day job as a social worker, also did volunteering work in her free time. See also: Hong Kong social worker Jackie Chen did not obstruct police actions during 2019 protest, defence argues in retrial She had volunteered not just in Hong Kong, but also in Qinghai and Sichuan in mainland China, as well as in Nepal and Southeast Asia, Pun said. If not for her court case, Chen would probably be in Myanmar or Thailand now, the barrister added, a reference to the recent earthquake in Myanmar that killed over 3,000 and also caused damage in neighbouring Thailand. Rioting is punishable by up to 10 years in jail, but Chen faces up to a seven-year term, the maximum sentence that can be handed down at the District Court. Deputy District Judge May Chung adjourned the case to April 9 for sentencing. Chen, who did not testify in the trial or call witnesses, pleaded not guilty last December to rioting during the 2019 demonstration. That day, protesters set up roadblocks in Wan Chai and Admiralty, clashing with police officers who deployed tear gas and water cannon to disperse them. The social worker, who was arrested near the intersection of Hennessy Road and Marsh Road at around 8.20pm on suspicion of taking part in an illegal assembly, was speaking through a loudspeaker to police and asking them to act with restraint. The judge, however, said in her verdict that Chen’s words incorrectly implied that the police’s operations were “overly quick or violent.” On Thursday, Pun said Chen did not take on a leadership role in the protests, often standing at the back. There was also no evidence that she encouraged others to engage in violent or radical behaviour. Chen’s overall participation in the riot was low, Pun said, adding that she played a “passive” role. According to Pun, Chen also did not “give up on herself” or on others after her arrest. She studied a psychology masters in special education needs and graduated in 2021, her barrister said. Still, the long judicial process took a toll on her and Chen fell ill. She takes medication to control the illness, he said, without elaborating on what she was diagnosed with. When Chen faces sentencing next week, three other defendants in the same rioting case – Lai Pui-ki, Chung Ka-nang, and Jason Gung – will also see their jail terms delivered. The three were also cleared of rioting, but the government appealed their acquittals. They changed their pleas to guilty last September, and have been remanded since. Protests erupted in June 2019 over a since-axed extradition bill. They escalated into sometimes violent displays of dissent against police behaviour, amid calls for democracy and anger over Beijing’s encroachment. Demonstrators demanded an independent probe into police conduct, amnesty for those arrested and a halt to the characterisation of protests as “riots.” Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | Apps Help safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team HKFP has an impartial stance, transparent funding, and balanced coverage guided by an Ethics Code and Corrections Policy.

The government is set to submit a bill that will strengthen its crackdown on e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products as early as the end of this month, local media reported on Wednesday citing sources. The ban on the possession of e-cigarettes would have two phases, starting in public from 2026 before extending to private places later, according to the reports. The extension would be implemented after the first phase-ban is evaluated, though there is no timetable yet. The bill would include “10 measures to curb smoking” that will also see the sale of alternative smoking items prohibited, such as non-menthol flavoured cigarettes and fruit-flavoured shisha, over the next two years, the reports said. Last year, Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau vowed that Hong Kong “will fully ban all alternative smoking products,” saying there was consensus in society towards lowering the smoking prevalence rate and mitigate the impact of e-cigarettes on the health of young people. The government said it hoped to reduce the smoking prevalence rate to 7.8 percent this year, compared to 9.1 percent in 2023. Some smoking curbs could be enacted this year, such as those targeting the smuggling, buying and selling of illicit cigarettes. The maximum penalty for possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes could be increased from HK$1 million and two years in jail to HK$2 million and seven years behind bars. See also: Hong Kong announces plan to ban use of e-cigarettes, even in private Travellers who are found to have brought into Hong Kong more duty-free tobacco products than allowed would be fined HK$5,000 – up from HK$2,000. They would also have to pay five times the required duties. Currently, visitors can bring 19 duty-free cigarettes into Hong Kong for their own use. No-smoking areas would also extend to cover three metres outside designated places such as the entrances of hospitals and schools. Smoking while queueing in outdoor public areas and sharing cigarettes with minors would also be banned. Hong Kong banned the import, manufacture, and sale of e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products in 2022.

HKFP,509893,Hong Kong man convicted in retrial over 2019 Yuen Long mob attack,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/03/hong-kong-man-convicted-in-retrial-over-2019-yuen-long-mob-attack/,2025-04-03T13:36:20,,"A Hong Kong man has been found guilty in a retrial over his involvement in the Yuen Long mob attack in 2019, after his acquittal was overturned last year. District Court Judge Eddie Yip convicted Wong Chi-wing of one count each of rioting and wounding with intent on Thursday after an appeal court in August sent back the case to Yip’s court. Yip previously acquitted Wong in 2021. On Thursday, however, the judge determined that Wong had participated in the mob attack on July 21, 2019, during which over a hundred white-clad, rod-wielding men stormed Yuen Long MTR station, leaving 45 people injured, including journalists, protesters, commuters, and pro-democracy lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting. The mob attack marked a watershed during the months-long anti-extradition bill protests and unrest in 2019 and prompted widespread criticism of police inaction and misconduct after some officers were seen leaving the scene or interacting with the white-clad men. Wong was among eight people facing rioting and wounding charges over the July 2019 attacks. He was the only one found not guilty, while the other seven were convicted. In August, the Court of Appeal ruled that the trial judge, Yip, had overlooked evidence presented in the case and, therefore, erred in determining that Wong was not among the attackers. The appeal judges then overturned Wong’s non-guilty verdict and sent his case back to be reconsidered by Yip. See also: Ex-lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting files bid to appeal against rioting conviction and jail term linked to 2019 Yuen Long attack Re-examining the evidence on Thursday, Yip decided that a pair of brown trousers and blue sneakers found at Wong’s residence, as well as his unmasked appearance, matched the appearance of a man photographed on the scene, according to local media. To date, 21 people have been convicted of rioting over the Yuen Long attack – 13 of them belonged to the “white-clad” group, including Wong. The rest were other people at the scene. Seven of them were found guilty in December and sentenced last month, including ex-lawmaker Lam. All seven men have lodged appeals against their convictions and prison terms. An eighth man, who was tried separately, was convicted of rioting last April and sentenced to two years and nine months in jail.

On a sunny Wednesday at a scenic park in Pingtan — just 130 kilometres (80 miles) from Taiwan — a steady stream of tourists wearing sunglasses and brandishing mobile phones hiked to the edge of a cliff for views of the self-ruled island. Ye Shenjian, snapping a photo of his wife and young son, told AFP he had seen news of the drills on TV and was hopeful that one day Taiwan would “return to China”. “I hope that one day we can ride the train directly to Taiwan,” he said. Another, Gao Feng, toured the park with his wife, using a looking glass to peer at nearby rock formations and the water. “I’d always heard of this beautiful place. I’ve wanted to come and see a bluer sea, which is pretty rare in China,” the 55-year-old doctor from eastern Anhui province said. “It’s pretty close to Taiwan. Makes me a bit sentimental.” For Gao and others in his generation, the idea of Taiwan under Chinese control has been much-discussed since his youth. “The liberation of Taiwan was something written in our primary school textbooks,” he said. “I’ve always believed we are one family, and a family should be together sooner or later.” Visiting with her friend from southwestern Yunnan, Wang Juedan also said she had Taiwan on her mind since her youth — the island produced some of her favourite television shows. “Seeing it feels pretty shocking,” she said. “We’ve only seen Taiwan on television in dramas or the news.” The 28-year-old said she hopes unification would come soon: “Travelling there will be more convenient.” Communist China has never ruled Taiwan, where indigenous tribes have lived for thousands of years. The island was partly or totally ruled at various times by the Dutch, Spanish, China’s Qing dynasty and Japan. While Beijing has threatened to use force to bring Taiwan under its control, and its annexation by China would likely see the eradication of the island’s vibrant democratic system and a crackdown on any opposition to Chinese rule. That did not phase retiree Wang Quanqiu, who said he had driven almost 2,000 kilometres from Beijing to Pingtan with his wife. He said he dreams of going back to Taiwan one day, which he visited twice before Taipei restricted Chinese residents from travelling there. “Once our precious island Taiwan returns, I want to drive my own car all the way to Taiwan,” the 71-year-old said. He and his wife stay up to date with the news about Taiwan as avid watchers of a regular state media programme on cross-strait activities, Wang said. “It won’t take that long for my dream to come true,” Wang said. AFP journalists saw a jet flying from the sea over the scenic area, which lies next to a Chinese military base — a stark reminder of the military drills taking place in the waters around Taiwan. Resident Liu Lili, visiting her son who studied nearby, also told AFP she was “looking forward to the day when China could get them back.” Liu, in her 50s, expressed disdain for some Taiwanese politicians — in particular former President Tsai Ing-wen. They were “eating China’s food”, she said. Pingtan locals were a little more circumspect. One resident, wearing a bright orange vest and tall rubber boots as she gathered waste from the ocean, said she did not expect Chinese leadership to use force. The woman, who did not want to share her name, said she and other locals kept their distance from anything related to China’s military — gesturing towards a set of an army compound atop a nearby mountain. “Locals definitely want peace.” Pingtan, China Produced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic standards.

HKFP,510019,"Deal to find buyer for TikTok ‘very close,’ says US Pres. Donald Trump",https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/04/deal-to-find-buyer-for-tiktok-very-close-says-us-pres-donald-trump/,2025-04-04T09:17:16,,"President Donald Trump said his administration was “very close” to a deal to find a buyer for TikTok, which faces a US ban if not sold by its Chinese owner by the weekend. “We’re very close to a deal with a very good group of people,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding that it involved “multiple” investors but giving no further details. The hugely popular video-sharing app, which has over 170 million American users, is under threat from a US law that passed overwhelmingly last year and orders TikTok to split from its Chinese owner ByteDance or face a ban in the United States. Motivated by national security fears and widespread belief in Washington that TikTok is ultimately controlled by the Chinese government, the law took effect on January 19, one day before Trump’s inauguration. But the Republican president quickly announced a delay that has allowed it to continue to operate; that delay is set to expire on April 5. Trump has downplayed risks that TikTok is in danger of being banned in the United States, saying he remains confident of finding a buyer for the app’s US business. The US president also suggested TikTok could even be part of a broader deal with China to ease the stinging tariffs he imposed on Beijing as part of a worldwide blitz of levies. Asked Thursday if he was willing to make deals with countries on tariffs, he said: “As long as they are giving us something that is good. For instance with TikTok.” He added: “We have a situation with TikTok where China will probably say we’ll approve a deal but will you do something on the tariffs. The tariffs give us great power to negotiate.” According to reports, the most likely solution would see existing US investors in ByteDance roll over their stakes into a new independent global TikTok company. Additional US investors, including Oracle and Blackstone, the private equity firm, would be brought on to reduce the proportion of Chinese investors. Much of TikTok’s US activity is already housed on Oracle servers, and the company’s chairman, Larry Ellison, is a longtime Trump ally. But uncertainty remains, particularly over what would happen to TikTok’s valuable algorithm. The New York Times suggested the new company could licence it from ByteDance. Amazon has also reportedly made a last-minute bid to buy TikTok. Produced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic standards.

HKFP,509956,How Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs will impact China,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/04/how-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs-will-impact-china/,2025-04-04T08:30:00,,"By Luna Lin and Oliver Hotham US President Donald Trump has slapped punishing new tariffs on imports of Chinese goods, deepening a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Beijing has vowed countermeasures in response and warned the new tariffs will cripple global supply chains — and Washington’s own interests. AFP looks at how so-called “liberation day” tariffs — which bring levies on Chinese goods to 54 percent — will hit China: China’s export-driven economy is particularly sensitive to vicissitudes in international trade. Trade between it and the United States, the world’s two largest economies, is vast. See also: Hong Kong businesses forced to weigh options as Trump’s tariffs squeeze access to US market According to Beijing’s customs data, sales of Chinese goods to the United States last year totalled more than $500 billion — 16.4 percent of the country’s exports. US duties also threaten to harm China’s fragile economic recovery as it struggles with a long-running debt crisis in the property sector and persistently low consumption — a downturn Beijing had sought to slow with broad fiscal stimulus last year. But an intensified trade war will likely mean China cannot peg its hopes for strong economic growth this year on its exports, which reached record highs in 2024. “The US tariffs on Chinese imports announced so far this year could fully negate the lift from the fiscal stimulus measures announced so far,” Frederic Neumann, Chief Asia Economist at HSBC, told AFP. And while he said the impact on export competition may be slightly mitigated by the fact that all countries are hit by the levies, he stressed “the drag on Chinese growth is nevertheless significant”. The new tariffs slap 10 percent levies on imports from around the world. But China — whose yawning trade deficit with the United States of $270.4 billion has long drawn Trump’s ire — faces much higher levies. The latest salvo adds 34 percent to a 20 percent rate imposed last month, bringing the total additional tariffs on imports from the Asian economic powerhouse imposed by the Trump administration to 54 percent. The tariffs come into effect in stages — a ten percentage point bump on Thursday, followed by the full levy on April 9. China is also under sector-specific tariffs on steel, aluminium and car imports. Analysts expect the new levies to take a significant chunk out of the country’s GDP, which Beijing’s leadership hope will grow five percent this year. Julian Evans-Pritchard, Head of China Economics at Capital Economics, said in a note he said he expected the economic hit to range from 0.5 percent to one percent of GDP. Likely to be hit hardest are China’s top exports to the United States — the country is the dominant supplier of goods from electronics and electrical machinery to textiles and clothing, according to the Peterson Institute of International Economics. But analysts also warn that because of the crucial role Chinese goods play in supplying US firms, the tariffs may also have major knock-on effects. “US imports from China are dominated by capital goods and industrial materials instead of consumer goods,” Gene Ma, Head of China Research at the Institute of International Finance, told AFP. “The tariff will hurt US manufacturers as well as consumers.” “This trade war not only has a destructive impact on China but also on the global trade system,” Chen Wenling, Chief Economist at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges in Beijing, said. Beijing has yet to specify what exactly its “countermeasures” will involve. But the retaliation could see Beijing hike pre-existing tariffs imposed in response to previous measures. “China’s countermeasures should be reasonable, beneficial and measured,” Mei Xinyu, an economist at the state-affiliated Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing, told AFP. “They need to be strong and precise, while also avoiding turning the countermeasures into a decoupling of China and the United States,” Mei added. China last month slapped tariffs of 15 percent in imports of coal and liquefied natural gas from the United States. Crude oil, agricultural machinery, big-engined vehicles and pickup trucks also face 10 percent duties. Analysts say those moves are designed to hit Trump’s support base — those in America’s rural heartlands that voted him into office last year. Beijing has called for dialogue to resolve the dispute, but any deal will take time. “There are still chances for the two parties to resume talks in the following months,” Betty Wang at Oxford Economics told AFP. “But historical experience suggests that tariffs are typically quick to rise and slow to fall.” Beijing, China Produced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic standards.

HKFP,509970,China vows ‘countermeasures’ to sweeping new US tariffs,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/03/china-vows-countermeasures-to-sweeping-new-us-tariffs/,2025-04-03T17:19:45,,"China on Thursday said it “firmly opposes” sweeping new US tariffs on its exports, vowing “countermeasures” to protect its rights and interests. US President Donald Trump has ignited a potentially ruinous global trade war after imposing 10 percent levies on imports from around the world and harsh extra duties on key trading partners. Trump unveiled particularly stinging tariffs of 34 percent on China, one of its largest trading partners. The commerce ministry in Beijing said in a statement that those tariffs “do not comply with international trade rules and seriously harm the legitimate rights and interests of the relevant parties”. It urged Washington to “immediately cancel” them, warning they “endanger global economic development”, hurting US interests and international supply chains. It also accused the United States of a “typical unilateral bullying practice”. The tariffs come on top of a 20 percent rate imposed last month. At a weekly briefing Thursday, the commerce ministry slammed Washington’s “protectionism and bullying”. But it also said that the two sides were “maintaining communication” over sources of contention in trade and economic issues. Beijing’s foreign ministry also warned the United States that protectionism has no “exit ramp” and noted the broad international opposition to the measures. China previously responded to US tariffs with levies of up to 15 percent on a range of US agricultural goods including soybeans, pork and chicken. Chen Wenling, chief economist at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges in Beijing, told AFP that Beijing could potentially impose export controls of critical and rare minerals to the United States in response. “The United States has become a high-tariff nation, and its status as the flagbearer of free trade has diminished,” Chen said. US duties have threatened to harm China’s fragile economic recovery as it struggles with a long-running debt crisis in the property sector and persistently low consumption. An intensified trade war will likely mean China cannot peg its hopes for strong economic growth this year on its exports, which reached record highs in 2024. Trump labelled Wednesday’s measures “reciprocal” but many experts say his administration’s estimates for levies placed on US imports by other countries are wildly exaggerated. “The US claims to have suffered losses in international trade, using so-called ‘reciprocity’ as an excuse to raise tariffs on all trade partners,” Beijing said. “This approach disregards the balance of interests achieved through years of multilateral trade negotiations and ignores the fact that the US has long profited significantly from international trade,” it added. It instead called for “dialogue” to resolve the dispute. “There is no winner in a trade war, and there is no way out for protectionism,” it said, adding that “history has proven that raising tariffs does not solve the US’s own problems”. The US has also imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel and aluminium imports. China is the world’s leading steel manufacturer, though not a major exporter of the product to the United States.

HKFP,509832,"Political artist Badiucao says billboards with his ‘hidden’ political message removed, as gallery launches attack",https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/03/political-artist-badiucao-says-billboards-with-his-hidden-political-message-removed-as-gallery-launches-attack/,2025-04-03T10:43:59,,"Chinese artist Badiucao has said that two Mong Kok billboards showing a clip he made with a hidden political message have been removed. Organisers would not confirm the removal but have denied the work is political, calling the Australian-based artist’s move “disrespectful.” Four-second black-and-white clips featuring Badiucao had been intermittently displayed on two LED billboards in Kowloon for Art Week. In the videos, the artist is seen silently mouthing a quote from Chairman Mao Zedong: “You must take part in revolution.” It is a quote from an essay featured in the Chinese Communist Party leader’s 1937 philosophical work On Practice. It is also the title of Badiucao’s graphic novel. The Mong Kok billboards were part of Art Innovation Gallery’s “Luminance” outdoor exhibition, which was launched last Friday, bringing together artists, designers, and brands. On Wednesday, Badicauo said in an X post that he understood the clip had been removed, representing the completion of his work. “The whole campaign captures the moment of repression [of] free expression in Hong Kong, whether it is coming from the authorities or inner fear within society,” he wrote. “But it also demonstrates the possibility of using creativity to infiltrate authoritarian systems.” Badiucao, who had used the pseudonym “Andy Chou” for the billboard project, said on Monday that he wanted to test the law whilst the flagship Art Basel fair was taking place. “There is no true creativity without freedom. Anything less is subpar, consumerist, and for the purchase of vapid billionaires and oligarchs. It is thus an indictment of Art Basel when it continues to stage its event in Hong Kong at a time when freedom of expression is under assault in the territory,” he said on Monday. Italy-based Art Innovation told HKFP on Wednesday that the artist gave “false information in order to be admitted to the exhibition,” describing the stunt as “really low.” In an emailed response, they said that they “are not political campaigners and we respect all forms and governmental rules, we have no interest in disseminating political views… it was the artist himself who added political descriptions and messages on his social media that are NOT in the exhibition, he only posted them later on social media.” They did not respond as to whether they knew of the artist’s true identity from the beginning, nor would they say if the artwork had been removed. They accused Badiucao of seeking media acclaim or trying to perform an act of dissent. “We are very embittered by this behaviour of the artist (more than political messages) who provided false information, making fun of the seriousness of professionals who have been working on the project for months and months with sacrifice and sweat and we believe it is really disrespectful to all the other artists who have respected the rules and the contract.” Calling Baiducao “a small person who defrauds the people he works with,” they included the artists’ original statement, which said the clip “explores the essence of presence – how we experience time, sensation, and awareness in fleeting moments.” Badiucao, born in Shanghai, China, is an award-winning political cartoonist, artist, and rights activist who has held exhibitions in the US, Europe, and Australia. He remained anonymous for years, but showed his face publicly in 2019, saying that the Chinese authorities had already identified him. The “Luminance” outdoor exhibition involved video art shown on LED screens on Sai Yeung Choi Street South and Argyle Street in Kowloon’s busy shopping thoroughfare of Mong Kok. It was originally set to end on Friday. “By combining art, technology, and urban visibility, Art Innovation redefines the traditional exhibition concept, transforming LED billboards into true digital canvases,” their press release last Friday said. Other artists featured on the Mong Kok LED boards this year included JungGyu Park, Sinisa K., Philip Giannattasio, Billy Ryan, Mat Voyce, Pacôme Pertant, Marcel van Luit, Elastique., Medina Kasimova & .ART Registry, Bonsai Mirai, Alan Bee, Josh Jen and Ariadna Canaan studio. During Art Week in 2023, the same gallery showcased a digital artist on a SOGO mall video billboard in Causeway Bay. However, artist Patrick Amadon was found to have hidden the names, ages, and jail terms of convicted Hong Kong protesters in the clip. It was removed shortly after he went public.

HKFP,509866,"Trump orders end to duty-free relief for small parcels from China, in blow to Shein, Temu",https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/03/trump-orders-end-to-duty-free-relief-for-small-parcels-from-china-in-blow-to-shein-temu/,2025-04-03T08:05:02,,"US President Donald Trump signed an order Wednesday to close a duty-free exemption for small parcels from China, in a move likely to severely disrupt the import of popular low-cost products. The rule has faced heavy scrutiny as US officials pointed to the growth of Chinese-founded online retailers Shein and Temu as a factor behind a surge of shipments using the exemption. The “de minimis” exemption allows goods valued at US$800 or below to enter the United States without paying duties or certain taxes. It has faced scrutiny due to a surge in parcels in recent years, with the White House saying that US Customs processes over 4 million exempted shipments into the US every day. In a fact sheet, the White House said that products imported under the exception from China would now be subject to a duty rate of either 30 percent of their value or US$25 per item, increasing to US$50 per item after June 1. Losing the exemption also means e-commerce firms potentially face more frequent inspections and must meet regulations on food safety and national security. According to analysts, some items currently imported through platforms like Temu or Shein might no longer be allowed into the US due to the extra burdens. Boasting an enormous selection of ultra-cheap items at a time when inflation has shrunk household spending power almost everywhere, Shein and Temu have become global phenomenons. The companies send out tens of billions of dollars worth of clothes, gadgets and other items from their vast network of factories in China annually. Official US figures show that exemption shipments rose to over 1.4 billion packages in fiscal year 2024, 60 percent of them from China. Other retailers such as Amazon might also be impacted by the “de minimis” removal. In February, Trump already scrapped the customs exemption but reversed his decision after the move caused major logistical disruptions. Beijing at the time responded with fury to the move, accusing the US of “politicizing trade and economic issues and using them as tools.” Washington, United States Produced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic standards.

HKFP,509037,,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/03/30/serious-loss-in-chinese-language-media-landscape-us-cuts-force-radio-free-asia-subsidiary-whynot-to-go-dark/,,,"Veteran Hong Kong journalist Justin is a freelance editor at Whynot, a Chinese-language online media outlet and a subsidiary of the US government-funded Radio Free Asia (RFA). Since US President Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January, Justin – not his real name – began to fret about the future of his media organisation. It turned out his fear was not unfounded. His contract has been suspended following an executive order Trump signed on March 14 to defund RFA’s parent agency, the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM). Around two dozen employees at Whynot and hundreds at RFA have been put on leave. Trump’s move against the USAGM – which oversees the Voice of America (VOA) and gives federal grants to RFA, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) and other news outlets – forced VOA to place more than 1,300 of its staff on leave and axed funding for RFA and RFE/RL. The cuts were part of the US president’s sweeping effort that he claimed would reduce federal spending and remake the US government. Critics warned that shutting down the news outlets would benefit US adversaries like China and Russia. RFA is “still providing limited news updates” following the grant cuts, according to a notice on its website. As of Saturday, it was still publishing stories from across the region. But Whynot has halted operations. “As RFA appeals against the grant termination, the future of Whynot is uncertain,” the online outlet said in a statement dated March 21, the last day the website was updated. Whynot occupies a unique position in the Chinese-language media landscape, employees and experts alike told HKFP, as there are few alternative platforms dedicated to telling human interest stories and covering topics that appeal to China’s younger population. Losing Whynot also means losing an important platform for a group of liberal-minded Chinese journalists to get editorial support and publish their stories, they said. “We have produced analyses and feature stories that are not commonly available in Chinese media,” Justin said in Cantonese, speaking under a pseudonym due to safety concerns. “Now this is simply lost.” Whynot was launched in September 2020, targeting young, educated Chinese as its audience. The online outlet said its mission was to encourage “genuine, diverse, and secure” conversations about significant topics in China. “If you always ask: ‘Why not?’ Then you must be one of us,” it said on its website. Since March 21, all of Whynot’s two dozen staff members – as well as its contractors – have been placed on leave, according to a Canada-based employee at the outlet, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to safety concerns. RFA spokesperson Rohit Mahajan told HKFP that the broadcaster had to rely on its own savings following the grant termination and that it had been forced to retain only around 70 of its 350 US-based full-time staff, placing the rest on furlough. About 500 contracts with stringers and freelancers worldwide were suspended, including those working for Whynot, he added. RFA is prioritising keeping foreign staff whose visas depend on employment and who will face persecution in their home countries, the spokesperson said. Some RFA journalists say they fear deportation if they lose their work visas. “We’re trying our best to keep all those folks not just on staff, but also receiving payments so they can continue” staying in the US, Mahajan said. RFA was established in 1996 to provide reporting to China, North Korea and other countries in Asia with limited press freedom. “RFA has been a vital source of information… on what is happening at the grassroots level in China and especially in regions like Xinjiang and Tibet, which are mostly off-limits to foreign correspondents,” said Sarah Cook, an independent researcher on China’s media landscape. “RFA’s Uyghur and Tibetan journalists have extensive contacts in the regions and among the diaspora, and are adept at collecting and verifying information on what is happening,” she said. While RFA focuses on straight news stories, Whynot is specialised in long-form journalism, offering in-depth analyses and feature stories on topics like China’s feminist movement and young Chinese who emigrated overseas. It also reported extensively on the “white paper” protests against Covid-19 lockdowns in 2022, even after they had ended. One year after the protests – the largest display of dissent in mainland China since the 1989 pro-democracy movement – Whynot published a series of reports on the whereabouts of those who were arrested during rallies, as well as the overseas civil society organisations that emerged following the demonstrations. Despite its relatively young age, Whynot has won multiple prizes, including a Society of Publishers in Asia (SOPA) Award, two Human Rights Press Awards, and an Online Journalism Award from the Online News Association (ONA). Both Whynot and RFA cannot be accessed from mainland China, where the “Great Firewall” blocks politically sensitive content, including from scores of other Western news media. Whynot’s link to RFA, as well as to the US government, is not overtly visible. It can be considered a “strategic decision” to keep Whynot away from China’s criticism of RFA, said Fang Kecheng, assistant professor in journalism at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “Will it benefit [Whynot] to say it is an RFA subsidiary when it comes to appealing to younger Chinese? It clearly won’t,” Fang told HKFP in Mandarin. Despite that, Fang said, Whynot’s coverage did not shy away from politics and its editorial stance had been “obviously” liberal. Its reportage also had a clear emphasis on telling human interest stories in China, he added. “To put it this way, [Whynot] is down to earth. It understands what is actually happening in China,” Fang said. “Its coverage tends to tell the stories of individual people and their fates. “These stories will be lost.” The Canada-based Whynot employee similarly mourned the loss of Whynot and its human-interest focus. “There are ample media outlets in the Chinese-language landscape that like to address China from a macro perspective,” he said in Mandarin. “Stories that concern people’s actual lives, in particular young people’s lives and their interests – they are not so common.” “We want to fill this gap,” he said, “and now this leaves a hole.” The suspension of Whynot may have a tremendous impact on a network of Chinese journalists who are likely to lose not only their jobs but also a channel for their creative output. Justin said they had put on hold planned stories about China-Japan relations and the fifth anniversary of the Beijing-imposed national security law in Hong Kong. “I have no idea about where I should go from now on, nor do the journalists I have worked with [at Whynot],” he said. He said that few other media organisations would have an interest in the type of stories Whynot had been publishing. Whynot “would run stories where other media wouldn’t,” he said. “This is a serious loss for the Chinese-language media landscape.” A possible option for Whynot journalists is to become freelance reporters and publish their stories through social media platforms such as YouTube and Instagram, Fang said. Some citizen journalists in mainland China have adopted this strategy. But that cannot be compared to news reports produced in a professional newsroom that has its own set of journalism standards, the scholar said. Moreover, more ambitious reportage that requires fieldwork and long-term investment will not be possible without financial support from a media outlet. Fang took as an example a Whynot documentary that was published in December 2024. It reported a surge of Chinese migrants entering the US illegally through dangerous treks in Colombia and Mexico, sometimes risking death. The crossing is known in Chinese as zouxian – “walking the line.” “Without a proper media institution that sponsors the reporting, an individual reporter can hardly accomplish such a task,” he said. After Whynot announced its suspension on March 21, some readers went to its Instagram page and left “thank you” comments. “We shall meet in a place where there is no darkness,” one netizen wrote. There is a possibility that Trump’s executive order will be reversed. RFE/RL said on Tuesday that it successfully challenged the decision in court and announced the following day that the USAGM had rescinded its letter terminating the grant for the broadcaster. Following its sister company’s court victory, RFA filed a similar lawsuit on Thursday. It said on Friday that it would “fully shut down by the end of April” if the court did not intervene. In a separate court case, a federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from dismantling VOA and prohibited the termination of RFA’s and RFE/RL’s grants. The Canada-based Whynot employee said he was “cautiously optimistic” about the prospect of RFA successfully challenging Trump’s decision, citing some bipartisan support for the broadcaster in Washington. But Fang argued that the grant termination had already underscored that US funding to the media outlets was not “guaranteed forever,” and that it could be subject to political uncertainty or even the whim of a president. “Any money has its own agenda,” he said. “This money, in particular, has a very clear agenda, and it is easily susceptible to the changes in Congress and the presidency. “The real question is whether there is a way to guarantee relatively stable financial support” to the media, the scholar said. “I think this is what society as a whole and people who genuinely care about these public issues should think about.” Fang said media outlets should diversify their funding, so that losing one stream of income would not lead to immediate closure. “Frankly speaking, it doesn’t sound quite right or healthy that high-quality journalism concerning the interests of young Chinese people is funded solely by the US government.” Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | Apps Help safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team Original reporting on HKFP is backed by our monthly contributors.

HKFP,508886,,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/03/29/explainer-hong-kongs-national-security-crackdown-month-57/,,,"In the third month of 2025, Hong Kong’s apex court handed down landmark rulings: quashing the convictions of three Tiananmen vigil activists and upholding jailed activist Tam Tak-chi’s conviction and prison term. Jailed media mogul Jimmy Lai ended his testimony; his trial has been adjourned until August, when the court will hear closing arguments from the defence and prosecution. Hong Kong’s security minister penned letters to hit out at a local and an international newspaper that published articles that were critical of rulings by the city’s courts. The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) ruled in favour of three Tiananmen vigil activists on March 6, quashing their convictions over failing to comply with a national security police data demand. The landmark victory was handed to Chow Hang-tung, Tang Ngok-kwan, and Tsui Hon-kwong, all from the now-disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organised three decades of vigils commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown before the event was banned. The trio were convicted and sentenced to four and a half months in jail in 2023 for failing to comply with a police demand for data under the Beijing-imposed national security law, after authorities alleged that the alliance was a “foreign agent.” They denied the allegation. Tang told reporters after the ruling that the decision could clear the alliance of the allegation and that “justice is in the hearts of the people.” During the trial and appeals at lower courts, heavily redacted information was presented as evidence, alleging that the Alliance had acted as a foreign agent. The trio rejected the categorisation and argued that the withholding of such information had denied them a fair trial, as they could not even see the unredacted evidence. The CFA sided with the trio in its judgement, saying that the redactions were “self-defeating” and produced “pages often completely covered in black ink.” Following the top court’s ruling, the Hong Kong government said it would study how to “improve” national security legislation in order to be “more effective in preventing, suppressing and punishing acts endangering national security.” The CFA on March 6 upheld the conviction and sentence of jailed activist Tam Tak-chi in a landmark challenge of a since-repealed sedition law. The former radio host was jailed for 40 months by the District Court in 2022 for 11 charges, including uttering seditious words. Tam was said to have chanted the controversial slogan “liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times,” a phrase ruled as capable of inciting others to commit secession in the city’s first national security trial. He was also accused of insulting the police by describing them as “damned black cops.” The five-judge panel led by Chief Justice Andrew Cheung ruled that the transfer of Tam’s case to the District Court was valid, and the prosecution was not required to prove the intention to incite as an element of the sedition offence. Tam’s appeal has far-reaching implications for sedition cases brought to the court under Article 23. Several ongoing cases had adjourned awaiting the appeal result, with lawyers saying that it could affect how the defendants may plead. The national security trial of jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai is set to hear closing arguments on August 14, with proceedings now adjourned for both parties to prepare for their submissions. On March 11, the 146th day of the high-profile trial, three hand-picked national security judges estimated that it would take eight days for the prosecution and defence to finish making their concluding remarks. The court initially scheduled the closing arguments to be heard in late July, but the date was changed to avoid clashing with another case. Lai, 77, has pleaded not guilty to two counts of conspiring to collude with foreign forces under the Beijing-imposed national security law, and a third count of conspiring to publish seditious materials under colonial-era legislation. He faces life behind bars if convicted. Lai wrapped up his testimony on March 6 after taking the witness stand for 52 days. His testimony began in November with his lawyer questioning him, followed by the prosecution’s cross-examination in January. After the prosecution finished their questioning earlier this week, his lawyer Steven Kwan began his re-examination. The tycoon has been behind bars for over 1,500 days and is currently serving a five-year-and-nine-month prison term over a separate fraud case. Secretary for Security Chris Tang lashed out at British newspaper The Guardian on March 23 over an article citing experts criticising a top court ruling on media mogul Jimmy Lai’s appeal as “another cut on the city’s once revered legal system.” The Guardian article contained “smearing remarks” against the city’s handling of national security cases, Tang said in a letter published on the Security Bureau’s website on Sunday, adding he wished to “set the record straight.” On March 17, the CFA denied Lai’s application to appeal against a lower court ruling that effectively barred him from hiring British lawyer Tim Owen for his national security trial. The Guardian called the top court’s ruling an “obscure legal development.” The newspaper cited British Judge Jonathan Sumption, who stepped down from Hong Kong’s top court last year. Sumption was quoted as saying that the ruling “tells us quite a lot about the view of the rule of law taken by the executive.” The security minister defended the verdict, saying there was “nothing obscure” about it. Lai’s “application for leave to appeal was dismissed through a summary procedure because it was wholly devoid of merits,” Tang wrote. Tang wrote a letter to local newspaper Ming Pao to condemn Johannes Chan, the former dean of the University of Hong Kong’s law faculty, after the latter penned an opinion piece criticising a court ruling. In his letter, published on March 5, the security chief said Chan had “undermined the rule of law,” “misled” the public, and “shaken the public’s confidence in the court system,” after the legal scholar criticised a judgment that sent seven men, including an ex-lawmaker, to jail for “rioting” in the Yuen Long attack in 2019. In his Ming Pao op-ed, Chan said the court had downplayed the actions of the armed, white-clad attackers in Yuen Long. On July 21, 2019, over 100 rod-wielding men dressed in white stormed the Yuen Long MTR station and attacked commuters and protesters coming home from a pro-democracy demonstration. Dozens – including Lam Cheuk-ting, then a Democratic Party lawmaker – were beaten and injured during the assault. Lam was sentenced to 37 months behind bars by District Judge Stanley Chan last month. He and his six co-defendants have filed an appeal against their convictions and sentences. Former Meta executive Sarah Wynn-Williams accused the social media giant of developing a censorship tool to monitor viral content in Hong Kong and Taiwan when Facebook attempted to gain access to the Chinese market. In an interview with National Public Radio (NPR) that aired on March 14, Wynn-Williams discussed her criticism of the company which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta has neither confirmed nor denied the allegation to HKFP. The former director of public policy claimed that the data of Hong Kong users “appeared to be one of the possible negotiating chips that Meta thought it was holding” when it tried to operate in China. A censorship tool was developed, which included monitoring viral content in Hong Kong and Taiwan by installing “virality counters,” the former executive said. “Any content that got more than 10,000 views would automatically be sent to the censorship editorial body that would review that content,” she said. The NPR interview was recorded before Meta obtained a court order barring the former employee from promoting her memoir, Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism, which alleged misconduct and harassment at the tech giant. Local media reported on March 18 that the stepfather of fugitive activist Tony Chung was taken in by Hong Kong national security police for questioning. He was reportedly “taken away” to “assist in the investigation” of Chung’s suspected offences of inciting secession and colluding with external forces to endanger national security. In response to HKFP’s enquiries, the police confirmed that the national security police brought in a person to assist with their investigation. Chung, the ex-convener of the pro-independence group Studentlocalism, was arrested in late July 2020, shortly after the national security law was enacted. He was jailed for three years and seven months in 2021 for inciting secession and money laundering, completing his term in June 2023. He fled Hong Kong in December 2023 to seek political asylum in the UK after the Correctional Services Department (CSD) allowed him to travel to Japan for Christmas. The top court is set to start livestreaming appeal hearings from April 1, but national security and high-profile political cases will not be included in the two-year pilot programme. Some hearings will be excluded from the scheme, however, such as “proceedings related to national security, high-profile public order cases, or highly politically charged cases,” the Judiciary said on March 11. In addition, the Judiciary will not broadcast hearings that concern the protection of interests of children or adults with learning disabilities, as well as those that involve trade secrets or commercial confidentiality. As of March 1, a total of 320 people had been arrested for “cases involving suspected acts or activities that endanger national security” since Beijing’s national security law came into effect, according to the Security Bureau. The number includes those arrested under Article 23, known officially as the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance. Of the 186 people and five companies that have so far been charged, 161 people and one company have been convicted or are awaiting sentencing. Among them, 91 people and four companies have been charged under the national security law, with 76 convicted. Five people have been charged under Article 23, three of whom have been convicted. The Security Bureau refused to provide a breakdown of the arrests, saying that specific arrest figures and relevant information about the government’s work on safeguarding national security could not be disclosed.

HKFP,508118,,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/03/23/four-trails-documentary/,,,"Hong Kong-born filmmaker Robin Lee never expected that Four Trails, his first feature-length production, would become a box-office success. Four Trails – a documentary about runners who competed in the Hong Kong Four Trails Ultra Challenge, the city’s gruelling ultramarathon race – was originally supposed to have only a limited release. It was expected to only make between HK$100,000 to HK$300,000 at the box office. “Because it’s a documentary of a fairly niche sport, everyone was just thinking, It’s just going to be a small screening,” Lee told HKFP at his Stanley walk-up flat, sitting at a dining table, also used as an editing station. However, after the documentary was released last December, tickets for the first five screenings sold out. Film distributor Edko doubled the number of screenings, and tickets were also gone. Again and again. “Because everything just sold out for an entire month, Edko [was] like, ‘OK, I think, enough people know about this film now,’” the film director recalled. The movie later enjoyed a wide theatrical release in January. It was shown in Broadway cinemas citywide, with 75 screenings a day. As of early March, it had raked in more than HK$9 million in box office sales. There was an early sign of Four Trails’ success. It won the Audience Choice Award at the Hong Kong Asian Film Festival in 2023. But Lee said its success at the box office still took everyone by surprise. “If you go by the numbers, by the books, Edko wouldn’t underestimate anything, because a traditional documentary doesn’t do more than what it does,” he said. Four Trails was shot during the 2021 edition of the annual ultramarathon. The trail running challenge was founded by Hong Kong-based German expat Andre Blumberg in 2012, and covers Hong Kong’s four major hiking routes – MacLehose, Wilson, Hong Kong, and Lantau – spanning a total distance of 298km. Among the runners featured in the documentary are: Stone Tsang and Salomon Wettstein, the golden boys of the Four Trails ultramarathon gunning for below 50-hour finishing time; Sarah Pemberton, the youngest of the participants and the only one to be taking on the challenge for the fourth time; dark horse Jacky Leung; and Law Kai-pong, who suffered a major injury just weeks before the race. In the film, they become more than just runners, each telling their own story of approach and ambition in participating in the ultramarathon. Wettstein, a tech consultant, times his race down to the second with surgical precision, while Pemberton challenges herself to claim the coveted title of “finisher” by completing the race under the 60-hour mark. Leung and Law, meanwhile, participate for the last time before leaving Hong Kong with their families. Lee had more than 10 years of filmmaking experience under his belt when he made Four Trails. However, faced with 200 hours of raw footage at one point, as well as the self-doubt and unfamiliar terrain that came with working on one’s debut feature, he eventually came to see the film as something of a commentary on his own marathon filmmaking process. He recalled the emotional roller coaster after editing the scenes of Wettstein deciding to drop out of the race. “I remember the first time I edited that, I was like, OK, I really like this. But after the 50th time of watching it, I [did not] get goosebumps anymore. I’d think, ‘Is it not good?'” he said. “That happens for every single segment… and you’ve just got to remind yourself of your initial feeling – that’s what hopefully the audience is going to feel when they watch it.” Making the film “was my personal Four Trails,” said Lee, who spent most of his childhood and early adolescence in Hong Kong. “You have the same lows that the runners do, but then maybe you edit one segment together, and then all of a sudden, it’s amazing.” The self-funded passion project was the culmination of a decade of working as a freelance videographer abroad. An avid skier in his youth – “fairly decent but nowhere near [professional],” he quipped – Lee began filming himself on the slopes after realising going pro wasn’t an option. He first tried with a GoPro camera before eventually upgrading to a Canon 7D, a gift from his father. Following brief stints at CNN and Ogilvy fresh out of university, Lee worked for a Colorado-based production company focusing on ski films, shooting in Japan, Iceland, Russia, India, and across the US and Europe. Five years into the job, he got bored, and while resting back home in Hong Kong, he realised: “I wanted to take the stuff that I did overseas and bring it back to Hong Kong.” In 2017, Lee directed another documentary, Breaking 60, named after the much-coveted 60-hour time limit to finish the ultramarathon. The earlier film was shorter and rougher around the edges. Though Lee didn’t know it at the time, the 45-minute vignette would pave the way for his debut feature. “It goes back to Breaking 60 and supporting friends who have done the four trails,” he said. That was how he learned to deploy his dozen-strong team at key checkpoints, based on the runners’ GPS-tracked locations, some stationary, some mobile. He learned that Shek O was a key turning point, infamous for being where runners start dropping out of the race, and the Twins, along the Wilson trail, was considered one of the hardest hikes in the city. “Climbing up to the Buddha, that section is just horrible, so let’s make sure we get a camera here,” he recalled. Before the actual February 2021 race, Lee filmed the participants on their training runs, including Tsang who did the MacLehose and Wilson trails in a single session. More than capturing some footage, it also allowed him to get to know each of the runners and to scout for key filming spots along the trails. “You’re kind of building this database of areas that you would like to film for purely aesthetic reasons, then other locations where you know that you can interact with [the runners] so they can talk to you, give their feelings, so you can build out their stories.” But despite the meticulous planning that went into capturing every turn of each runner’s race, Four Trails was nothing short of a surprise. All eyes were on Tsang and Wettstein, the duo with an ambition to “break 50,” but no one expected Leung to finish the four trails in 49 hours and 21 minutes. “It was just like the film, just a complete shock that something like this is happening,” Lee said. Leung, then 37 years old, doesn’t even make his first appearance until the final third of the film, though not quite as a result of a conscious creative decision by the team. Because of the staggered start times, which had Leung kick off second to last, no one realised that he was actually close to leading the pack. And because he had joined late, filling a slot after internationals pulled out in the lead-up to the event, there was no interview footage of him on his training runs. At one point in the film, it is almost as if you realise before he does: Leung is on his way to break 50. Then the tape rewinds, bringing the audience back to the starting line, showing Leung, seemingly unremarkable, at the beginning of his 49-hour swan song. “No one knew about Jacky [Leung] until the Lantau Trail. The film portrays it exactly how we were feeling,” Lee said. “So I came up with the rewind, don’t really show Jacky in the first half because no one was really paying attention to him, and edit the film how it played out.” In a way, the process of filming Four Trails mirrored the unpredictability of the ultramarathon. No amount of planning could prepare the runners for what would come on the trail, or the film crew for Leung’s finish. Call it a lapse in judgement, a logistical constraint, or a lack of preparation, but Lee was just happy it turned out well. “I’m incredibly grateful that that happened,” he said. “In the trail running community, we always knew that it would be popular, but I always wanted to make it a film [that] people outside the community could enjoy. So that was a big goal when I was editing it and putting it together and filming it.” Throughout his interview, Leung makes offhanded mentions of the 2021 race being his “last,” without mentioning explicitly his plan to leave the city in a matter of months. Fast forward to the release of Four Trails in December, he was in his third year in Edinburgh. Lee, meanwhile, is in conversations with a distributor to bring the documentary overseas. It would be small, intimate screenings, with the simple aim of bringing the film to Hong Kong communities overseas. “But we really want to get it out there,” the director said. “People… have watched it in Hong Kong and asked us when’s the film going to go on platforms, not for them to watch it again but because they want to show people overseas that this is what Hong Kong has.” Leung would also mention how uplifting and motivational Four Trails turned out. It was a fitting counterpoint to the emotional catharsis of a recent wave of Hong Kong cinema. As the Hong Kong Film Critics Society put it, “local structures of feeling,” the natural scenery, and each runner’s personal narrative all made Four Trails a “timely boost of morale to a low-spirited Hong Kong.” The film even inspired a group of primary school students to hike the final stretch of the Lantau trail and make a pilgrimage to the green mailbox in Mui Wo, the finish line of the ultramarathon race. While hoping he would also get something out of that boost, the director said he was in no rush to take on another film project. “Four Trails took three years and it’s probably going to be even more out of my life, which I’m grateful for and I’m happy to do it, but it’s such a big commitment that I don’t want to jump into another project without having that same motivation,” Lee said. Making the documentary “was my own four trails,” he said again, adding, “and maybe there’s a lot of Hongkongers who’ve got their own four trails, whatever it may be.” Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | Apps Help safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team Original reporting on HKFP is backed by our monthly contributors.

HKFP,509824,"Merging Hong Kong’s public broadcaster and gov’t PR wing ‘counterproductive,’ commerce chief tells lawmaker",https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/02/merging-hong-kongs-public-broadcaster-and-govt-pr-wing-counterproductive-commerce-chief-tells-lawmaker/,2025-04-02T19:59:36,,"Hong Kong’s commerce chief has turned down an idea floated by a lawmaker to merge the city’s public broadcaster and the government’s public relations department, saying such a move would be “counterproductive” to official communication work. Speaking during a Legislative Council (LegCo) meeting on Wednesday, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said the government-funded Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) and the Information Services Department (ISD), which publishes news for the authorities, were two departments with “no overlapping” functions. “Although RTHK and the ISD are both government departments and both carry the responsibility of disseminating government information, RTHK, as the public service broadcaster, and the ISD, being responsible for the government’s public relations, perform different duties,” he said in Cantonese. He added that merging them “may confuse the public… which may be counterproductive to the government’s overall public relations work.” His remarks were a response to lawmaker Junius Ho, who asked about ways to enhance “compatibility” of the two departments and even a possible merger as the city recorded large fiscal deficits for three consecutive years. Yau said that RTHK and the ISD were home to 762 and 451 job posts respectively in the current fiscal year, and that the staff in each department required different skills and experience. RTHK has to “cater for the needs of the mass audience,” including minority groups in Hong Kong, with programmes ranging from public affairs and national education to sports and lifestyle, he said. Meanwhile, the ISD is responsible for the government’s publicity and news dissemination, he said. The two departments have “distinctly different” missions, services, and operations, the commerce chief added. But lawmaker Regina Ip – also the convenor of the Executive Council, Hong Kong’s top advisory body – appeared unconvinced, saying that the two entities lacked “fundamental reform.” She also claimed RTHK was full of “redundant staff,” citing her experience being interviewed by the broadcaster, which she said brought more crew members to the interview than other media outlets. “While other broadcasters have one person on the mic and another in charge of the lighting, RTHK may easily show up with four people or even eight,” Ip said in Cantonese. “Sometimes [RTHK] does not air an interview long after it has been recorded. Those interviews risk being outdated,” she added. In response, Yau said that RTHK had already explored cost-cutting measures, such as using artificial intelligence in programming, and that the broadcaster would continue to do so. He added that authorities would “seriously consider” the lawmakers’ comments. During the same LegCo meeting, Clarence Leung, undersecretary of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, which oversees the ISD, also said that the department had been keen to adopt the latest technologies in promoting the government’s work. HKFP reported last year that RTHK began using AI-generated voices in place of some human presenters. An RTHK spokesperson told HKFP at that time that the technologies could help “relieve the staff shortage pressures.” The public broadcaster was caught in the crosshairs of pro-Beijing supporters, who accused it of being sympathetic to the city’s pro-democracy protesters during the protests and unrest in 2019. Since then, RTHK underwent a major restructuring that included scrapping its long-standing satirical show Headliner and adopting new editorial guidelines.

HKFP,509785,Hong Kong gov’t launches 1-month public consultation on legalising basketball betting,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/02/hong-kong-govt-launches-1-month-public-consultation-on-legalising-basketball-betting/,2025-04-02T18:58:33,,"The Hong Kong government has invited members of the public to submit their views on its proposal to legalise basketball betting in the city. The government announced on Wednesday the launch of a one-month consultation on a regulatory regime for basketball betting under the Betting Duty Ordinance. A 16-page consultation document was released for the public to give feedback until May 2. The government proposed amending the ordinance to grant the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs the power to issue a basketball betting license to the Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC). The regulatory regime will mirror the existing one for football betting, the government said. According to the proposal, the licensing period will be fixed, and the government has the power to limit the number of bet types and classes of competitions. The licensed betting operator shall not accept bets from underage individuals or credit bets. Basketball matches involving Hong Kong teams or those that take place in the city are barred from bets to “promote a betting-free and healthy environment for the sport in Hong Kong,” the government said. The licensed operator should also display notices reminding the public of the seriousness of gambling addiction and provide information about services for gambling disorders, the government said. “As a matter of policy, the government does not encourage gambling,” a spokesperson for the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau said. “There is, however, undeniably an actual and persistent demand for gambling in Hong Kong which, if left unregulated, would likely give rise to illegal gambling activities and associated social problems and other criminal activities,” the spokesperson added. Financial Secretary Paul Chan unveiled the government’s intention to regulate basketball betting during his 2025 Budget speech in February. He said the legalisation could tackle illegal gambling and raise tax revenue, given the city’s estimated deficit of HK$87.2 billion. The finance chief projected that regulating basketball betting could generate HK$1.5 billion to HK$2 billion in tax revenue. According to estimates from the HKJC, the turnover for illegal basketball betting reached between HK$70 billion and HK$90 billion last year. In Wednesday’s consultation paper, the HKJC said that illegal betting in Hong Kong “has grown at an alarming rate.” The licensed operator for football betting and horse racing estimated that around 100,000 to 150,000 Hongkongers had bet illegally on basketball in 2023, and said that the number tripled last year to 430,000. Police efforts to combat illegal gambling are “significantly complicated” by the rapid digitalisation of illegal betting and technological advancements, the government said. The use of cryptocurrencies, stored-value tools, and micro-transactions has made illegal betting activities more covert, it said. “Against such [a] backdrop, a timely policy intervention to regulate basketball betting is considered necessary,” the consultation document read. In February, the Hong Kong Committee on Children’s Rights criticised the government’s plan to regulate basketball betting, saying that giving a green light for basketball betting was a “disastrous move.” The group went on to say that popularising sports betting could “lure” young people to bet with their limited financial resources that were otherwise budgeted for other needs. Gambling loss may also result in psychological pressure and guilt, which may deter individuals from seeking help, it said, warning that gamblers could enter a “vicious cycle” where they turn to lending agencies or engage in criminal activities.

HKFP,509780,"China military practises hitting key ports, energy sites in Taiwan drills",https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/02/china-military-practises-hitting-key-ports-energy-sites-in-taiwan-drills/,2025-04-02T17:47:23,,"China’s military said it practised hitting key ports and energy sites during “live-fire” drills Wednesday as part of exercises aimed at Taiwan, the democratic island it claims as its own. The surprise manoeuvres were criticised by Washington as “intimidation tactics” and come after Taiwan President Lai Ching-te called China a “foreign hostile force”. Named “Strait Thunder-2025A”, the drills were in the middle and southern parts of the Taiwan Strait as well as the East China Sea, the military said. The strait is a vital artery for global shipping. The military said it held “long-range live-fire drills” and practised hitting “simulated targets of key ports and energy facilities” during the exercises. Wednesday’s exercises aim to “test the troops’ capabilities” in areas such as “blockade and control, and precision strikes on key targets”, said Senior Colonel Shi Yi, spokesman of the Chinese military’s Eastern Theater Command. China’s Shandong aircraft carrier was also carrying out drills testing the ability to “blockade” Taiwan, the Eastern Theater Command said. Taipei has condemned the Chinese exercises. The island of 23 million people is a potential flashpoint between China and the United States, which is Taiwan’s most important security partner. #ROCArmedForces have deployed mission aircraft, vessels, and shore-based missile systems to closely monitor and maintain situational awareness of #PLA aircraft and ships entering our response zone. pic.twitter.com/BVX7VurPCT The US State Department said Beijing’s “aggressive” military activities and rhetoric towards Taiwan “only serve to exacerbate tensions and put the region’s security and the world’s prosperity at risk”. Chinese leaders vigorously oppose Washington’s support for Taiwan and detest Lai, who they call a “separatist”. Drills in the strait come a day after China sent its army, navy, air and rocket forces to surround Taiwan for exercises Beijing said were aimed at practising for “precision strikes” and a blockade of the island. That prompted Taipei to dispatch its own air and maritime forces as part of a “Rapid Response Exercise”. Taiwan’s defence ministry said Tuesday China had deployed 21 warships around the island, including the Shandong carrier group, along with 71 aircraft and four coast guard vessels. That was the highest number of warships detected during a single day in nearly a year, and the most aircraft since October 2024. China’s Eastern Theater Command kept up its propaganda on Wednesday, posting a “Paralysing Strikes” poster on its Weibo account, showing Chinese forces surrounding Taiwan and firing missiles at the island. Meng Xiangqing, a professor at the PLA National Defence University, warned Taiwan was vulnerable to supply disruptions due to its lack of energy and other resources. “In the end, it will be the regular people of the island who suffer,” Meng said in a video carried by state broadcaster CCTV. Beijing has ramped up military pressure on Taiwan in recent years and held multiple large-scale exercises around the island that are often described as rehearsals for a blockade and seizure of the territory. Tensions have escalated since Lai took office in May 2024 and adopted tougher rhetoric than his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen in defending the island’s sovereignty. While Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign country, only 11 mostly Pacific and Caribbean countries and the Vatican recognise its claim to statehood. Last month, Lai called China a “foreign hostile force” and proposed 17 measures to combat growing Chinese espionage and infiltration. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth vowed “robust, ready and credible deterrence” in the strait during a visit to the region last week. Taipei analyst Wen-Ti Sung said China was using “stress test after stress test” to gauge the strength of US President Donald Trump’s support for Taiwan and other allies in the region. “China is creating occasion after occasion for the Trump administration to publicly show how its support… is weaker or more conditional than in years past,” Sung told AFP. Beijing was also trying to paint Lai as “the provocateur” to get what it wants on Taiwan from Washington, including reduced US support, Eurasia Group’s Amanda Hsiao said. The United States is legally bound to provide arms to Taiwan, but Washington has long maintained “strategic ambiguity” when it comes to whether it would deploy its military to defend the island from a Chinese attack. There have been concerns over Trump’s willingness to protect Taiwan, especially after he upended US support for Ukraine. Communist China claims Taiwan has been part of its territory since “ancient times”, but it has never governed the island. The island was partly or totally ruled at various times by the Dutch, Spanish, China’s Qing dynasty and Japan, and has been inhabited by indigenous tribes for thousands of years.

HKFP,509759,"US report says human rights further curtailed in Hong Kong, as city slams ‘slanders and smears’",https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/02/us-report-says-human-rights-further-curtailed-in-hong-kong-as-city-slams-slanders-and-smears/,2025-04-02T15:13:52,,"Hong Kong has slammed “untruthful remarks, slanders and smears” in a US report accusing Beijing and local authorities of taking further steps to curtail human rights in the city through national security legislation. In its 2025 Hong Kong Policy Act Report issued Monday, the US Department of State said that Beijing and Hong Kong last year “took actions that eroded Hong Kong’s judicial independence and rule of law” and there was “no expectation” of a fair trial for national security cases. It cited the Hong Kong national security committee’s instruction to block overseas witnesses from testifying in jailed Tiananmen crackdown vigil organiser Chow Hang-tung’s national security trial. The report also noted the sentencing of 45 pro-democracy advocates in a landmark national security trial over their unofficial primary election, “despite this being peaceful political activity protected by the Basic Law and recognized in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.” The Hong Kong government hit back with a statement on Tuesday evening, saying it “strongly condemns and rejects the wanton slander about and political attacks” in the US report. It also accused Washington of “blatantly interfering in Hong Kong affairs which are entirely China’s internal affairs.” The 3,300-word English-language statement also pointed to a fresh round of sanctions on Hong Kong officials, saying it “clearly exposed the US’s barbarity under its hegemony, which is exactly the same as its recent tactics in bullying and coercing various countries and regions.” Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Guo Jiakun separately said on Tuesday that the US report was “composed of falsehoods and disinformation” and constituted “grave interference” in China’s and Hong Kong’s affairs. The Hong Kong Policy Act Report, which is compiled and submitted to Congress each year, provides an overview of the state of Hong Kong’s basic rights and freedoms. The latest US report also said that Hong Kong’s homegrown national security legislation, also known as Article 23, which was passed in March last year, had expanded the government’s powers. It said that “there were credible reports that government security services monitored pro-democracy and human rights activists, their families and acquaintances, and journalists in Hong Kong.” It also noted “transnational repression” against Hong Kong democracy advocates living overseas who had arrest warrants and bounties issued against them under Hong Kong’s national security laws. Separate from the 2020 Beijing-enacted security law, the homegrown Safeguarding National Security Ordinance targets treason, insurrection, sabotage, external interference, sedition, theft of state secrets, and espionage. The Safeguarding National Security Ordinance includes “clear definitions of the elements that constitute an offence, only making necessary and reasonable restrictions on basic human rights and freedoms,” the Hong Kong government said on Tuesday. The statement also defended the government’s extraterritorial application of the national security laws, saying it was necessary to pursue those who “blatantly engage in activities endangering national security” against Hong Kong and Beijing.

HKFP,509751,US lawmakers seek to rename street for jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/02/us-lawmakers-seek-to-rename-street-for-jailed-hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai/,2025-04-02T14:00:00,,"US lawmakers moved Tuesday to rename the street next to Hong Kong’s Washington office after Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy media owner jailed as China clamps down in the financial hub. A bill introduced in the House of Representatives would erect the street sign “Jimmy Lai Way” on a stretch alongside the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Washington’s bustling Dupont Circle area. “We want to remind every HKETO employee of their part in dismantling the freedoms that once made Hong Kong the most vibrant and prosperous city in Asia,” said Representative Chris Smith, the Republican co-chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which examines rights in the country. While Congress has less jurisdiction outside of Washington, the bill would also direct the US Postal Service to deliver mail to Hong Kong’s offices in New York and San Francisco if they are addressed to “1 Jimmy Lai Way” in either city. There was no immediate timetable to act upon the proposal. The bill had co-sponsors from the Democratic Party but met opposition from the capital’s non-voting delegate to Congress, Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton. “No matter how well-intentioned an initiative is, it is never appropriate for members of Congress not elected by DC residents to legislate on local DC matters, particularly quintessentially local ones like street names,” she said. Lai was the founder of the Apple Daily, a now-shuttered Chinese-language newspaper that championed mass demonstrations in 2019 aimed at safeguarding democratic liberties promised when Beijing took control of the former British colony. China quelled dissent after the protests, some of which involved vandalism, including through a tough security law. Lai, now 77, has been behind bars since December 2020. He testified for more than 50 days, concluding last month, as he fights charges of foreign collusion under the law that could carry a sentence of life in prison. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a recent interview said that Lai’s case was a “priority” for him. Rubio on Monday imposed sanctions on Hong Kong’s police chief, justice secretary and other officials on human rights grounds over the crackdown in the city. The bill on the street name calls on Rubio to look at sanctions on additional officials specifically involved in Lai’s detention and prosecution. Renaming streets has long been a means to embarrass countries on their rights records. Russia’s embassy in Washington lies on Boris Nemtsov Plaza, named for the reformist politician killed near the Kremlin in 2015, and the Saudi embassy is on Jamal Khashoggi Way, named for the dissident writer who was strangled to death and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. Both streets were renamed by votes of the DC City Council. But an effort to name the plaza outside of China’s embassy for Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Prize-winning writer and democracy activist who died in prison, floundered after intense opposition from Beijing. Other governments have sometimes acted similarly with the United States. The street outside the US consulate in Kolkata is named for Vietnamese revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh.

Ernest Lee pleaded guilty at the West Kowloon Magistrates’ Courts to the offences on Tuesday, according to court news outlet The Witness. He stood accused of “destroying” lift doors and banners in multiple locations, including pedestrian bridges in Wan Chai and Causeway Bay, between May and December last year. He wrote slogans in Chinese like “Taiwan independence,” a reference to Chinese President Xi Jinping as Winnie the Pooh, and claims that the Chinese Communist Party had brought “disaster” upon Hong Kong, the prosecution said. Lee, a logistics worker, was charged with one count of committing acts with seditious intention and eight counts of criminal damage. He pleaded guilty to the sedition charge and four of the criminal damage counts, with the other four dropped by the prosecution. According to the case details reported by the Witness, police discovered the slogans written in black marker on the lift doors of pedestrian bridges in Wan Chai in May, June, and October last year. In December, a technician inspecting a lift in a bridge connecting Harbour Road and Tonnochy Road in Wan Chai found graffiti written in a black marker, which read: “Chinese Communist Party bandits brought disaster on Hong Kong. They and their families must die.” The technician alerted the police, after which officers reviewed CCTV footage and identified Lee, then 53 years old. Under police caution, Lee admitted to writing the slogans. He told police he was unhappy with the verdicts in the 47 prominent democrats’ national security case and the Yuen Long mob attack case. The latter refers to suspected triad members attacking MTR passengers during the 2019 protests and unrest, which led to protesters and bystanders, including a former opposition lawmaker, being charged and found guilty of rioting. During mitigation, barrister Steven Kwan – representing Lee – said his client was a man of few words and also had autism that runs in his family. Kwan added that Lee did not commit the acts out of revenge or to bring danger to anybody. Judge Victor So, a designated national security judge, said the court could not ignore the defendant’s aim of expressing dissatisfaction with the government and venting his inner hatred. The slogans he wrote also involved cursing the central government and using insulting names to refer to the “motherland,” So said. Separate to the 2020 Beijing-enacted security law, the homegrown Safeguarding National Security Ordinance targets treason, insurrection, sabotage, external interference, sedition, theft of state secrets and espionage. It allows for pre-charge detention of up to 16 days, and suspects’ access to lawyers may be restricted, with penalties involving up to life in prison. Article 23 was shelved in 2003 amid mass protests, remaining taboo for years. But, on March 23, 2024, it was enacted having been fast-tracked and unanimously approved at the city’s opposition-free legislature. The law has been criticised by rights NGOs, Western states and the UN as vague, broad and “regressive.” Authorities, however, cited perceived foreign interference and a constitutional duty to “close loopholes” after the 2019 protests and unrest.

It comes after Raymond Siu stepped down as the city’s top cop on Tuesday. He entered pre-retirement leave after serving for 36 years. Chow said during a press conference on Wednesday that safeguarding national security will remain a top priority for the police under his leadership. “It must be most important and instrumental for us to safeguard the national security. At the same time, [we are] hoping to enhance the national security awareness of the whole community,” he told reporters. Asked why the police needed to strengthen awareness in Hong Kong given already extensive efforts, Chow said that threats remained: “Very often some people are still trying to seek… any loopholes that they can use to instigate some actions to threaten national security,” he said. He also warned of “undercurrents” and “soft resistance” in the art, culture and media sectors. Asked about freedom of assembly in Hong Kong, Chow said such rights are provided for in the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution, but that police will review any applications for demonstration on a case by case basis. “We will evaluate and also conduct threat assessments… [depending] on the events and the capability of the organisers,” he said. Director of Crime and Security Keith Yip will take on Chow’s role, pending approval, according to local media citing sources on Monday. Previously Siu’s deputy, Chow, 52, is known for leading a two-week police operation around the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) during the peak of the 2019 protests and unrest. Pro-democracy demonstrators barricaded themselves on campus, with the operation leading to 1,377 arrests. Chow joined the police force in 1995 as an inspector, according to its website, before being promoted to superintendent in 2010. He served as a criminal intelligence officer at Interpol in France between 2012 and 2013 and then joined the Criminal Intelligence Bureau in 2013, eventually commanding the bureau in 2016. In 2017, he was promoted to district commander of Yau Tsim Mong and became deputy regional commander of Kowloon West in 2019. Further promotions saw him take charge of the Operations Wing and the Personnel Wing. By 2023, he had assumed the No 2 position in the force. Chow is scheduled to hold a press conference at 12.30pm on Wednesday. In a Wednesday press release, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee welcomed Chow’s appointment. “Mr Chow has served in the Hong Kong Police Force for almost 30 years and has extensive experience in criminal investigation, intelligence gathering, policy-making as well as personnel management,” Lee said. “He has a distinguished performance and possesses proven leadership skills. I am confident that he will capably lead the Police Force in meeting the challenges ahead.” He also paid tribute to Siu’s “commendable efforts in maintaining Hong Kong as one of the safest cities in the world.” “He has demonstrated unswerving dedication and determination to safeguarding Hong Kong and upholding the rule of law in dealing with the social unrest. During his tenure, he has also been devoted to introducing strong and effective measures to prevent deception cases and combat criminal activities,” he added. Having taken on the top job in 2021, Siu led the police force through the implementation of two national security laws. Siu was among six top officials sanctioned by the US on Monday, drawing a backlash from the local and national authorities. The sanctions included blocking individuals’ assets in the US and banning them from receiving travel visas. In a statement released in the early hours of Tuesday, the Hong Kong government condemned the US. The US State Department announced the new measures for what Washington said were the officials’ roles in “transnational repression” and “implementing the [Beijing-imposed] National Security Law.” It came after the city issued arrest warrants for 19 individuals currently residing overseas over national security allegations, including pro-democracy activist Joey Siu, a US citizen, as well as others who were granted political asylum in the United States. Crime rose on Siu’s watch. The city logged over 90,000 reported crime cases in 2023 – a 28.9 per cent increase from a year earlier – while last year, it recorded more than 94,700 reported crime cases.

HKFP,509688,Hong Kong international school group ESF seeks 4.8% tuition fee hike,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/02/hong-kong-international-school-group-esf-seeks-4-8-tuition-fee-hike/,2025-04-02T09:35:52,,"Hong Kong’s largest international school group is looking to raise tuition fees by an average of 4.8 per cent for primary and secondary school students, subject to approval by the city’s Education Bureau. In a letter to parents on Monday, the English Schools Foundation (ESF) CEO Belinda Greer said that the group’s board had approved proposed fee hikes, ranging between HK$650 and HK$750 per month. Annual tuition fees for primary school students, from Year 1 to Year 6, will increase by 4.9 per cent in the 2025-26 academic year, from HK$132,500 to HK$139,000, according to the statement. Meanwhile, secondary school students in Years 7 to 10 will see their tuition fees rise from HK$173,900 to HK$181,100 – up 4.1 per cent. Fees for upper secondary school students, while still subsidised, will also increase. A 4.73 per cent tuition hike will apply to Year 11 students, from HK$152,200 to HK$159,400. Meanwhile, for students in Years 12 and 13, their fees will rise by 4.68 per cent, from HK$160,100 to HK$167,600. Greer gave assurance in the statement that despite the increase, the ESF’s fee level “remains amongst the lowest of any international school or group in Hong Kong.” A recurrent subsidy scheme for ESF schools is gradually being phased out after the foundation accepted a government proposal in 2013 to stop public funding. The ESF began phasing out government funding in the 2016-17 school year and is set to fully complete the process in the 2028-29 school year. Year 10 will not be subsidised in the upcoming school year. Separately, Discovery College, an ESF-operated private international school that does not receive government subsidies, is seeking larger fee hikes of around 5.9 per cent – a monthly increase of HK$900 to HK$1,190 – for both primary and secondary school students. Renaissance College, another unsubsidised private school run by the ESF, plans to raise tuition fees for students from Year 1 to Year 13 by around 4.8 per cent. The ESF is also seeking fee increases at the five international kindergartens it operates, also without government funding, ranging from HK$600 to HK$1,080 per month – the equivalent of a 6.3 to 10 per cent hike. “I know that the Hong Kong economy, like that of the world more generally, continues to face uncertainties,” Greer said. “I want to assure you that our commitment to a prudent ‘best value’ financial model remains resolute.” Last year, the EDB approved the ESF’s application to raise tuition fees by around 4.8 per cent for the current academic year.

HKFP,509699,Chinese developer under scrutiny over Bangkok tower collapse during Myanmar earthquake,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/01/chinese-developer-under-scrutiny-over-bangkok-tower-collapse-during-myanmar-earthquake/,2025-04-01T21:58:43,,"By Sally Jensen and Chayanit Itthipongmaetee A Chinese construction company is facing questions over the deadly collapse of a Bangkok skyscraper — the only major building in the capital to fall in a catastrophic earthquake that has killed more than 2,000 people in Thailand and neighbouring Myanmar. The 30-storey tower, still under construction, was to house government offices, but the shaking reduced the structure to a pile of rubble in seconds, killing at least 13 people and injuring nine. It was the deadliest single incident in Thailand after Friday’s 7.7-magnitude quake, with the majority of the kingdom’s 20 fatalities thought to be workers on the building site and hopes fading for around 70 still trapped. Sprawling Bangkok bristles with countless high-rise blocks, but none have reported major damage, prompting many to ask why the block under construction gave way. “We have to investigate where the mistake happened,” said Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who has ordered a probe into the materials and safety standards at the construction site. “What happened from the beginning since it was designed? How was this design approved? This was not the first building in the country,” she told reporters on Saturday. The development near Bangkok’s popular Chatuchak market was a joint project involving China Railway No. 10 Engineering Group (Thailand) — an offshoot of China Railway Group (CREC), one of the world’s largest construction and engineering contractors. Testing of steel rebars — struts used to reinforce concrete — from the site has found that some of the metal used was substandard, Thai safety officials said on Monday. Industry Minister Akanat Promphan announced that a committee would be set up to investigate, saying one supplier of the steel had failed safety tests in December and may have its licence withdrawn. He did not name the supplier. Professor of Civil Engineering at King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang Suchatwee Sunaswat said there were questions to be answered. “We have to look at the design. At the beginning, how they calculate, how they design. And in the rescue mission, how they collect evidence at the same time,” he told reporters on Saturday. The local partner in the project, Italian-Thai Development (ITD) offered condolences on Monday to quake victims but said it was “confident” the incident would not impact its other projects. Beijing-owned building conglomerate CREC is one of the world’s largest construction and engineering contractors, with projects in more than 90 countries and regions, according to its website. The Bangkok construction collapse is not the first time CREC and its subsidiaries have come under fire after deadly incidents. A tide of anger was unleashed at authorities in Serbia following the deaths of 14 people when a roof collapsed in November last year at a train station built by CREC subsidiaries — largely focused on reports of alleged shortcuts made with building projects. Roisai Wongsuban of the Migrant Working Group advocacy organisation said there have been a large number of complaints from migrant workers employed by Chinese companies in Thailand about lax safety standards and poor labour rights. “For Chinese companies we can’t see the human rights due diligence, to see if labour standards are being met,” she told AFP. “There is always a power imbalance between employer and employee.” Bangkok’s construction boom is powered by an army of labourers, a large proportion of them migrant workers from Myanmar, toiling on hot building sites for low pay. The Migrant Working Group has called on Thailand’s labour ministry to hold the employers involved in the construction project criminally liable if they have failed to meet health and safety laws. AFP has asked China Rail No. 10 Engineering Thailand and CREC for comment but has not had a response. An announcement celebrating the completion of the main structure at the Chatuchak construction site, posted on China Rail No. 10’s official WeChat channel, was deleted soon after Friday’s quake. AFP archived the post shortly after the tremors hit but before the page was removed. Local media said that four Chinese nationals were apprehended on Saturday for attempting to retrieve documents from the collapse site. But China is the largest source of foreign direct investment in Thailand, injecting $2 billion into the kingdom in 2024, according to Open Development Thailand, and the government typically handles anything linked to Beijing with kid gloves. Paetongtarn said an investigation into the collapse launched on Monday would not be “specific to one country”. “We do not want one particular country to think we are only keeping eyes on (it),” she said on Tuesday. At a small shelter near the site on Monday, 45-year-old Naruemol Thonglek waited for news of her boyfriend, electrician Kyi Than, who was missing under the enormous mound of concrete and twisted metal being lifted by mechanical diggers. “I’m devastated,” she told AFP. “I’ve never seen anything like this in my entire life.” Bangkok, Thailand Produced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic standards.

HKFP,509581,Chinese political artist Badiucao sneaks message onto Mong Kok billboards for Hong Kong’s Art Week,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/01/chinese-political-artist-badiucao-sneaks-message-onto-mong-kok-billboards-for-hong-kongs-art-week/,2025-04-01T20:30:19,,"Chinese artist Badiucao has said he snuck a political message onto two billboards in Mong Kok during last week’s Art Week. Organisers have denied the work is political. Four-second black-and-white clips featuring Badiucao are being intermittently displayed on two LED billboards, where the Australia-based artist is seen silently mouthing a quote from Chairman Mao Zedong. “You must take part in revolution,” is a quote from an essay featured in the 1937 philosophical work On Practice, by Mao, the Chinese Communist Party’s founder. In a Tuesday statement, Badiucao said the quote – which is also the title of his new graphic novel – should “present no problems in the territory, or for anyone in China for that matter.” The Mong Kok billboards are part of Art Innovation Gallery’s “Luminance” outdoor exhibition, which was launched last Friday and brought together artists, designers, and brands. Badiucao, who had used the pseudonym “Andy Chou” for the billboard project, said he wanted to test the law whilst the flagship Art Basel fair was taking place. “Art Basel is a prestige global event — and its value is partly reliant on the ability of artists at the fair and in the greater ecosystem to freely express themselves,” he said. “There is no true creativity without freedom. Anything less is subpar, consumerist, and for the purchase of vapid billionaires and oligarchs. It is thus an indictment of Art Basel when it continues to stage its event in Hong Kong at a time when freedom of expression is under assault in the territory.” It is unclear what Italy-based Art Innovation knew of the stunt. When asked whether they knew of the artist’s true intentions and identity, they did not reply directly. “I am sorry but the work in the exhibition has nothing to do with political messages,” the gallery said in an emailed response, adding there was “no news” surrounding the matter. Without naming them, they included the artists’ original statement, which said the clip “explores the essence of presence – how we experience time, sensation, and awareness in fleeting moments.” Badiucao, born in Shanghai, China, is an award-winning political cartoonist, artist, and rights activist who has held exhibitions in the US, Europe, and Australia. He remained anonymous for years, but showed his face publicly in 2019, saying that the Chinese authorities had already identified him. The “Luminance” outdoor exhibition is set to continue until Friday between 10am and 10pm daily. The clips are being shown on Sai Yeung Choi Street South and Argyle Street in Kowloon’s busy shopping thoroughfare of Mong Kok. “By combining art, technology, and urban visibility, Art Innovation redefines the traditional exhibition concept, transforming LED billboards into true digital canvases,” their press release last Friday said. Other artists featured on the Mong Kok LED boards this year included JungGyu Park, Sinisa K., Philip Giannattasio, Billy Ryan, Mat Voyce, Pacôme Pertant, Marcel van Luit, Elastique., Medina Kasimova & .ART Registry, Bonsai Mirai, Alan Bee, Josh Jen and Ariadna Canaan studio. During Art Week in 2023, the same gallery showcased a digital artist on a SOGO mall video billboard in Causeway Bay. However, he was found to have hidden the names, ages, and jail terms of convicted Hong Kong protesters in the clip. Art Innovation displayed No Rioters, by Patrick Amadon, on a 70 x 20-metre LED screen for several days before it was removed prematurely.

After operating in the Kowloon residential district for almost 16 years, GH Whampoa will host its final screenings on April 9, Golden Harvest said in a Facebook post on Monday night. “With effect from 10 April 2025, GH Whampoa will be closed due to the expiry of tenancy. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused. We hope to see you again at other GH cinemas!” the post read. The four-screen cinema, with more than 1,200 seats, will show four classic Hong Kong films on the evening of April 9: HK$40 for the general public and HK$30 for members. Moviegoers currently can enjoy a 20 per cent discount on snacks purchased at the cinema’s kiosk, while selected snack items will be sold at HK$16 on the cinema’s last day of operation. Holders of tickets from GH Whampoa may also claim a HK$10 discount on snack purchases at other Golden Harvest cinemas from April 10 until the end of the month. GH Whampoa’s ticket sales revenue plunged from around HK$36.7 million in 2019 to HK$6.8 million in 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic began to hit Hong Kong, data from the Hong Kong Film Development Council showed. Between 2020 and 2022, cinemas in Hong Kong had to close intermittently, and capacity limits were imposed due to anti-epidemic regulations. Despite the resumption of normalcy in 2023, cinema revenues remained weak. GH Whampoa, for example, earned around HK$21.3 million that year, still below pre-pandemic levels. Last year, nine local cinemas closed as overall box office receipts in Hong Kong marked the weakest performance since 2011, according to figures compiled by Hong Kong Box Office Limited. Total box office revenue amounted to HK$1.3 billion in 2024 – down 6.2 per cent from 2023, it also said in January.

As of Tuesday, the Hong Kong Theatres Association’s website showed that it had 53 members: 13 on Hong Kong Island, 20 in Kowloon, and 20 in the New Territories. Golden Harvest Whampoa was still listed as a member. Newport Theatre in Mong Kok announced last month that it would shut its doors after 20 years of operation. Sun Digital, a modern cinema that was added to the historic Sunbeam Theatre in 2012, also closed when curtains fell on the cultural landmark in March.

HKFP,509632,China holds large-scale military drills around Taiwan,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/01/china-holds-large-scale-military-drills-around-taiwan/,2025-04-01T16:16:18,,"By Joy Chiang with Mary Yang in Beijing China on Tuesday sent its army, navy, air and rocket forces to surround Taiwan for large-scale drills Beijing said were aimed at practising for “precision strikes” and a blockade of the self-ruled island. Taiwan dispatched its own aircraft and ships, and deployed land-based missile systems, in response to the exercises and accused Beijing of being the world’s “biggest troublemaker”. The drills come after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Sunday in Japan that the United States would ensure “credible deterrence” across the Taiwan Strait. China opposes US support for Taiwan, which Beijing insists is part of its territory and has threatened to use force to bring it under its control. Beijing has increased the deployment of fighter jets and naval vessels around Taiwan in recent years to press its claim of sovereignty, which Taipei rejects. China deployed 21 warships around the island, including the Shandong aircraft carrier group, along with 71 aircraft and four coast guard vessels, Taiwan’s defence ministry said. The number of warships was the highest since May last year when 27 navy vessels were reported, according to an AFP tally of the ministry’s daily figures. That was the most recorded since May last year when 27 navy vessels were reported, according to an AFP tally of the ministry’s daily figures. Tensions across the 180-kilometre (112-mile) Taiwan Strait have escalated since Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te took office in May 2024. That was the most recorded since May last year when 27 navy vessels were reported, according to an AFP tally of the ministry’s daily figures. Tensions across the 180-kilometre (112-mile) Taiwan Strait have escalated since Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te took office in May 2024. Chinese leaders loathe Lai, who has been more outspoken than his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen in defending Taiwan’s sovereignty. Lai last month called China a “foreign hostile force” and proposed measures to combat growing Chinese espionage and infiltration. Tuesday’s exercises were aimed at sending a “stern warning and forceful deterrence” to alleged separatists in Taiwan, Beijing said. They involved “sea-air combat-readiness patrols, joint seizure of comprehensive superiority, assault on maritime and ground targets, and blockade on key areas and sea lanes”, said Senior Colonel Shi Yi, spokesman of the Chinese military’s Eastern Theater Command. Beijing’s armed forces “close in on Taiwan Island from multiple directions”, he said. The drills also involved training for “multi-directional precision strikes” around the island, the Eastern Theater Command said in a statement. The Chinese military’s Eastern Theater Command — which oversees operations along the Taiwan Strait — shared a graphic with the title “closing in”. Another graphic shared by the military depicted Lai as an insect being roasted over an open fire. And a video shared by the military on X-like Weibo showed footage of weapons interspersed with animations of Sun Wukong, the legendary Monkey King from the classic Chinese novel “Journey to the West”. The video climaxes with Chinese forces appearing to use satellites to mark targets across Taiwan, before ending with a flurry of rocket explosions while multiple Monkey Kings attack a giant frog monster. China’s coast guard said it also conducted “law enforcement patrols” around the island. “Pursuing ‘Taiwan independence’ means pushing the people of Taiwan into a dangerous situation of war,” Zhu Fenglian, a spokeswoman for Beijing’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said. Taiwan’s Presidential Office condemned “China’s escalatory behaviour”, and Premier Cho Jung-tai said “resorting to displays of military force is not what modern, progressive societies should pursue”. China has carried out multiple large-scale exercises around the island in recent years, often described as rehearsals for a blockade and seizure of the territory. Analysts have speculated that China was more likely to attempt a blockade of Taiwan than launch an all-out invasion, which was riskier and would require a huge military deployment. Taipei military expert Su Tzu-yun told AFP the drills appeared to be of similar size to the “Joint Sword” exercises in May and October. Holding drills straight after Hegseth’s visit to the region showed China was testing the Trump administration, said Lin Ying-yu of Tamkang University. “China wants to test the US’s bottom line ahead of a Trump-Xi summit through military exercises,” Lin told AFP. Taiwan — a powerhouse in semiconductor chip manufacturing — is a potential flashpoint for conflict between China and the United States, which is the island’s most important security partner. While the United States is legally bound to provide arms to Taiwan, Washington has long maintained “strategic ambiguity” when it comes to whether it would deploy its military to defend the island from a Chinese attack. There have been concerns about US President Donald Trump’s willingness to protect Taiwan. Trump said last month that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be “catastrophic”, as the island’s chipmaking titan TSMC announced a $100 billion investment in the United States. The dispute between China and Taiwan dates back to 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang nationalist forces fled to Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil war with Mao Zedong’s communist fighters. Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign country, but has stopped short of declaring formal independence, which is a red line for Beijing. Only 11 countries and the Vatican recognise Taiwan’s claim to statehood. Taipei, Taiwan Produced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic standards.

HKFP,509164,,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/03/29/ck-hutchisons-panama-ports-deal-between-business-decision-and-national-security/,,,"I generally hesitate to say anything about what appears in the Chinese-language press, because it reaches me only second-hand, and in translation. But recent commentaries in Ta Kung Pao have me puzzled. I do not participate in controversies about China, for or against. Such matters are not very interesting, and in any case, as a marooned Brit, none of my business. But I thought I understood how the game was played. Take the row about Huawei and its exclusion from the business of providing telecom networks in Western countries. What we might call the Trumpeters’ tune is that there is no such thing in China as a private company. Whether or not Huawei wished to tweak its software to facilitate spying, it would have no choice. But this is a smear peddled only by China haters and stirrers-up of trouble who wish to start a new Cold War. Actually, Huawei is free to make its own decisions and would not dream of tricking its customers in this way. A similar division of views hovers over the Belt and Road scheme. Critics say this is a cunning ruse through which China can extend its ownership and control over vital links in the world trade network. Not at all, explain the scheme’s defenders. Belt and Road projects are win-win affairs that benefit everyone concerned: both the trading countries at each end of the road and the country that actually contains the port, railway, canal, or whatever. They are a benevolent donation to the common good by China, and the eventual ownership of the items constructed will normally be vested in the country in which they sit. Then there is the matter of the national security law. When this first appeared, many critics (I rather think I may have been one of them) complained that there was a shortage of precise definitions of the new offences created. Not at all, we were assured. The descriptions of the offences were perfectly adequate, and nobody who had read them carefully would be in any doubt as to what was intended. All three of these comfortable thoughts have been thrown into doubt by the leader writers at Ta Kung Pao, who are generally assumed to be privy to the truth as senior Hong Kong government people see it. The news that stirred all this up was that CK Hutchison – generally regarded as a Hong Kong firm, though most of its business is elsewhere and its registration is in the Cayman Islands – was selling 40 ports to an American consortium led by BlackRock. Among the ports in question are two next to the Panama Canal, about which President Trump has been complaining bitterly. Hutchison’s explanation was that this was a purely business decision, basically to get out of the overseas ports business; the group will still own ports in Hong Kong and mainland China. In view of the danger of tariff wars shredding the international trading network, this is not an ostentatiously surprising decision. It did not, though, go down well with Ta Kung Pao. Hutchison’s move was denounced as a “betrayal of all Chinese people,” an act of “spineless grovelling.” Former chief executive Leung Chun-ying asked, “Do merchants have no motherland?” See also: State-backed paper’s criticism of Hutchison’s Panama port deal shared by Beijing’s office on Hong Kong affairs Well, no doubt the whole thing would have looked more attractive if US President Donald Trump had not so rudely called for changes in the Panama Canal Zone in the first place. On the other hand, if Hong Kong companies (we’ll leave the Cayman Islands out of it) are expected to tailor their activities to Beijing’s foreign policy objectives, how can we be expected to believe that mainland firms do not? As the row rumbled on, the deal was stigmatised as sabotaging the Belt and Road initiative. This is not what we used to be told about the Belt and Road at all. Is Ta Kung Pao now of the view that the purpose of the Belt and Road scheme was to ensure that no container could be unloaded anywhere in the world without China’s approval and participation? And as the writers warmed to their task, we came to the inevitable ingredient in any political storm these days: national security. Was the sale of the ports a national security crime? Well, one rather hopes not. The crimes created by the national security law are secession, subversion, terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security. Clearly, the first three are not relevant, and it is difficult to see how the fourth could be applied to selling a business asset for a realistic price to a foreign buyer. It may be a source of pride and pleasure for Chinese people to know that one of their numbers is a global presence, but it can hardly be a national security necessity for someone with a Chinese name to own a port on the other side of the Pacific. A couple of thoughts might soothe. The first is that ownership of two Panama ports does not confer any power at all over the canal, which remains the property of Panama and under the control of the Panama government. The ports are actually outside the canal proper, and their main function is to deal with Panama’s own imports and exports. President Trump does not seem to know this, among many things. The second is that the new American owners will not be under the same pressure or expectations that local patriots would like to exert on Hutchison. Much has been made of the fact that the chief executive of the buyers, BlackRock, is an old friend of Donald Trump. Well, all these plutocrats go to the same parties, no doubt. But American business is not inhibited by concerns about the national interests of the US, or indeed anywhere else. Ethical standards have gone down the tubes over the last 50 years. Money trumps morals every time. Ports controlled by American companies will be ruled by pure greed, unsullied by politics. Doesn’t that feel better?

HKFP,506953,,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/03/16/commenting-on-or-criticising-court-cases-is-both-legal-and-helpful-in-hong-kong/,,,"It is nice to know that the secretary for security reads Ming Pao. Think of the alternatives. Sadly, however, the secretary, Chris Tang, often does not appear to enjoy his reading. The last item to arouse Mr Tang’s ire was law professor Johannes Chan’s op-ed on the latest legal installment of the Yuen Long incident. “The author, who is a law professor, has once again published a biased article,” Mr Tang complained, “deliberately ignoring the fact that some white-clad people have already been brought to justice, misleading readers with a warped perspective that the court has made an unfair judgment regarding either party, shaking the public’s confidence in the court system, and undermining the rule of law in Hong Kong, which must be condemned.” Mr Tang went on to say that the afterword, commonly added to opinion pieces these days, saying there was no intention to incite hatred of the government, did not discharge the obligation on the editor to ensure that his publication was “fair, objective, and unbiased.” See also: Hong Kong security chief condemns legal scholar for ‘undermining rule of law’ in op-ed on Yuen Long attack court ruling He concluded: “It is hoped that Ming Pao will not continue to be exploited by people with ulterior motives to use this platform to spread confusing remarks, to poison the community, and to create conflicts.” Now I propose ignoring some of this. Opinion pieces are not supposed to be fair, objective, and unbiased. They are expressions of opinion. Moreover, if Mr Tang wishes to campaign with any credibility for unbiased media, he needs to avoid the impression that he has some unique problem with Ming Pao. I shall also pass by the bit about white-clad people being brought to justice, which strictly speaking is entirely irrelevant. Injustice to one defendant cannot be balanced by justice to another. More interesting is Mr Tang’s claim that the offending piece misled readers into the “warped perspective” that the court had made an unfair judgment, and that this had “shaken the public’s confidence in the court system,” thereby undermining the rule of law. This is, alas, nonsense. The rule of law has never required the public to believe that judges are infallible. In 1793, the then chief justice Lord Kenyon said, “In the hurry of business, the most able Judges are liable to err.” More recently, we can consider the view of Lord Denning: ”We do not fear criticism, nor do we resent it. For there is something far more important at stake. It is no less than freedom of speech itself… Those who comment can deal faithfully with all that is done in a court of justice. They can say that we are mistaken, and our decisions erroneous, whether they are subject to appeal or not.” Or there is the rather more literary, oft-quoted, opinion of Lord Atkin (more famous as an innovator in business law), which goes in part: “The path of criticism is a public way. The wrong-headed are permitted to err therein… Justice is not a cloistered virtue; she must be allowed to suffer the scrutiny and respectful, even if outspoken, comments of ordinary men.” I infer that Mr Tang is offering the courts protection, which they have never sought and do not need. If a judge makes a statement about the law, it is open to criticism and comment. Similarly, if the judge is sitting alone and has to make findings of fact, they may also be scrutinised. The rule of law is fortified, not weakened, if the activities of the courts can be discussed and debated. He may also care to consider that freedom of the press is not furthered by threatening words from officials in the law and order industry, and if the government wishes to offer a running commentary on media output, this might be better left to the information specialists. It is unnecessary for Mr Tang to repeatedly insist that appending “this piece is not intended to inspire hatred of the government,” or words to that effect, is not an effective bar to prosecution. We all know that. It’s like starting a novel with the usual stuff about “no resemblance to real persons, living or dead.” This will not keep you out of the libel courts if your lead villain is an erratic politician called Ronald Frump. Mr Tang may be a happier reader if he bears in mind the wise words of the late US judge Robert Jackson: “The price of freedom of religion or of speech or of the press is that we must put up with, and even pay for, a good deal of rubbish.” And if tempted to rush to the defence of some official masterpiece, he might also bear in mind another observation from the same judge. “Who does not prefer good to ill report of his work? And if fame – a good public name – is, as Milton said, the ‘last infirmity of a noble mind,’ it is frequently the first infirmity of a mediocre one.” Advocates for ideas and draws conclusions based on the interpretation of facts and data.

HKFP,508059,,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/03/22/hong-kong-indie-band-an-id-signal-on-new-album-born-out-of-2019-protests-and-covid-19-pandemic-curbs/,2025-03-22T10:20:00,,"Having its roots in Hong Kong’s underground music scene, An Id Signal has never adhered to any mainstream playbook. Since their emergence from the depths of Hong Kong’s industrial spaces in 2006, the four-piece band has maintained a memorable presence by performing in live houses and throwing guerrilla gigs. It has never been a household name, but to the city’s indie community, the 19-year-old band is a long-lived legend. With the release of a new album last month, An Id Signal wants to reach more people in Hong Kong, especially in the lingering aftermath of the 2019 protests and the Covid-19 pandemic – a double whammy that has profoundly changed the underground music scene over the past half-decade. Their long-awaited album, The Path Where Grief and Joy Intersect – released 13 years after their last – is a poignant reflection of Hong Kong’s collective experience while holding fast to the band’s aesthetic style. “We have been making music with a rather personal style,” said Leung Wing-lai, the band’s frontman and lyricist. “But now our focus has changed, and we need to connect to more people.” Despite intentional ambiguity in the lyrics, symbols that reference the pro-democracy protests and unrest in 2019 – and the fallout – can be heard in the eight-track album. Some new songs also appear to be conversational, touching on issues such as farewells and reunions, as opposed to the band’s earlier hits that were more about one’s inner self. “I think it’s what has happened in our time that makes us more outward-looking. Even in the underground scene, you know that it has been changed,” Leung told HKFP in Cantonese. During the pandemic, the city’s underground music venues had to grapple with stringent social-distancing measures. Legendary live house This Town Needs – which survived rent hikes and government crackdowns – shut down in 2020. But new faces emerged – both on and off the stage – whenever policies allowed for live music to happen. “The pandemic had been a critical change to the indie scene. You saw a lot of bands scattered around the city, performing deep underground,” Leung said. “Also, you met a lot of new people, who earnestly wanted to listen to music.” However, the band also feels that free expression in the city has been curtailed in recent years. “Especially after 2019, my personal feeling is that fewer and fewer things can be said in this place,” said drummer Kitt Lau. This has created a sense of urgency for underground artists like themselves. “For us, perhaps, it’s about going back to our roots, which is to speak through music,” Lau said. The making of An Id Signal’s third full-length album spanned the entire pandemic. The songs were first conceived by guitarist Chan Ho-nam. Leung wrote the lyrics in Cantonese and then sang them in a vocal teetering between screams and murmurs. They said most songs on the album also featured ideas from the band’s ex-members and earlier writings. Some songs evolved in jam sessions or in live performances over the years. “To me, the songs have always been there, but they have not yet been completed,” guitarist Chan said. “When the right moment comes, we will know,” Lau, the drummer, added. However, there is at least one song, “a flash of longing,” that has a clear origin. Leung wrote it on July 1, 2020, when thousands of Hongkongers rallied against a national security law imposed by Beijing, following the protests and unrest the previous year. Over 10,000 people were arrested in relation to the 2019 protests. Following the 2020 imposition of the national security law, scores of the city’s prominent pro-democracy activists and politicians were prosecuted. In another song, which bears the same title as the album, the lyric goes: “Summer nights run straight into winter” – an apparent reference to a widely shared slogan painted on a wall by a protester in 2019. “Frankly, I was thinking of the people on the street in 2019,” Leung said of writing the song. The months-long protests and unrest faded as Covid-19 hit the city in early 2020. The July 1 rally that year was one of the last large-scale displays of dissent seen in Hong Kong. Leung said the political events five years ago have influenced his writing, as he now looks beyond his personal feelings for inspiration. “As time passes and things happen, our experiences have turned into deeper feelings for this place, and for the people around us,” he said. “If it was 12, 13 years ago, I would not have known how to write these songs… So this is the right timing. Not earlier, not later.” When the band performed some of the new songs during the pandemic, it was a far cry from what the band was used to in the past. In the 2010s, An Id Signal would perform in live music venues buried in Hong Kong’s industrial buildings. They also threw spontaneous guerrilla gigs in public areas, inviting people through word of mouth and text messages. Still, a crowd of diehard fans would show up. But it was virtually impossible to play shows in such settings during the pandemic due to social distancing measures. The only possible venues for indie music were mid-sized halls that were large enough to accommodate people without breaking anti-pandemic rules. Shows were also only allowed sparingly between outbreaks. It was to their surprise that the first show An Id Signal played during the pandemic, in 2022, had drawn old and new audiences alike. “There were new faces and old friends… in a brand new venue that we would have never performed in in the past,” Lau said. “It felt familiar but strange.” Realising that the underground scene may have changed forever, the band embraced bigger stages and seized any opportunities to perform. “Practically speaking, the physical space [for underground music] has shrunk, so we have to go whenever opportunities arise,” bassist Ying Ka-lok said. But they said they were not turning away from their roots. “We have never left [the underground],” said Leung. “We are now facing a larger audience in the hope that our music will have greater resonance. This is important to us.” “It is the resonance that matters, and it has nothing to do with where we play our music,” Chan added. Last December, An Id Signal headlined the indie stage of Clockenflap – Hong Kong’s largest music festival – for the first time. Clockenflap was held in Central Harbourfront, with the indie stage in Tamar Park. They said it was not without a sense of sarcasm for the band to play on a stage right under the shadow of the government headquarters – a building nicknamed by the authorities “door always open.” “We were the little people underneath it,” Leung quipped. The album’s debut performance on April 3 will see An Id Signal return to a more familiar setting, in San Po Kong’s Portal, right next to the band’s first album launch party in 2006. They wish to see their childhood peers – three of them were born in the 1980s – and to meet new friends. “It’s been a while, we hope to see you that night,” the band wrote on Instagram. See also: ‘Tomorrow never knows’: Hong Kong indie collective seeks community, history for the city’s alternative music scene Two decades on, Leung said, it is invaluable that the band is still passionate and creative in making music. What’s more, he said, is that An Id Signal has been part of the underground music ecology that continues to evolve. Yet, with all the changes in recent years, An Id Signal could also become a living testament to the history of Hong Kong’s underground music. “There are a lot of new fans who do not know what it was like before [the pandemic and the 2019 protests],” Lau said. “You need a band that has been around long enough… to be able to bring out the past.” English translation of An Id Signal’s lyrics is courtesy of Hong Kong poet Tim Tim Cheng.

HKFP,507230,Hong Kong as a plan B: Why some mainland Chinese turn their back on city after acquiring top talent visas,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/03/16/hong-kong-as-a-plan-b-why-some-mainland-chinese-turn-their-back-on-city-after-acquiring-top-talent-visas/,,,"Having migrated to Singapore with her family four months ago, Lindsey quickly found her feet in the city-state. She enrolled her children in school, hired a domestic worker, rented a 1600-square-foot apartment, and started her own business consultancy firm. A former executive at an international consulting company, Lindsey said that she decided to leave mainland China due to her growing sense of insecurity with the government strengthening its authoritarian rule. Her first choice was to emigrate to the US. As a “cost-free back-up plan,” she applied for Hong Kong’s Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS), targeting graduates from top universities. Lindsey, who graduated from a top university in mainland China, got the visa. However, when the US plan fell through in early 2024, she and her family decided not to relocate to Hong Kong. Instead, they opted for Singapore, which the middle-class family considered to have more advantages than Hong Kong, especially in terms of economic development and political autonomy. For topics we can’t talk about in China, can you say it in Hong Kong now? You can’t. “Ultimately, does it make any difference between going to Hong Kong and staying in mainland China?” asked Lindsey in Mandarin. “For topics we can’t talk about in China, can you say it in Hong Kong now? You can’t.” Lindsey, who is living in Singapore on an employment visa after setting up her own company, is not interested in going to Hong Kong. “My TTPS visa should expire early next year, but I am not planning to extend it,” she told HKFP. Lindsey is one of mainland Chinese who have successfully obtained a TTPS visa but decided not to live in Hong Kong. She and several other TTPS visa holders agreed to speak with HKFP under pseudonyms due to privacy concerns and the sensitivity of the topic. Hong Kong launched the TTPS in December 2022 to attract talent after an exodus of professionals following the imposition of a national security law and years of strict Covid-19 curbs. TTPS applicants are not required to secure any jobs in advance. But they need to fulfil at least one of three criteria: an annual income no less than HK$2.5 million during the past year; a degree from a top university and at least three years of work experience over the past five years; or a degree from a top university over the past five years, with no work experience required. The government keeps a list of recognised “top universities,” which currently numbers 199. Once approved, visa holders are able to work and live in the city for two to three years. They can renew their visa if they are employed as a full-time worker or establish a business in Hong Kong. After seven years, they can apply for permanent residency. With a lower threshold than other talent programmes, the TTPS now contributes to a major share of work visas in Hong Kong. As of December 2024, the Immigration Department approved over 270,000 work visas under various schemes over the past two years. One-third of them – or more than 90,000 visas – were TTPS visas. Three-quarters of the overall work visa holders were from mainland China, official figures showed. Under the TTPS, the share of mainland Chinese was much higher: a whopping 95 per cent. So far, there is no data as to how many TTPS visa holders have decided to stay – or turn their back on the city like Lindsey. The TTPS has had its share of criticism, including from former chief executive Leung Chun-ying. He said on Facebook in late February that he had met visa holders who went back to mainland China as soon as they got their residence permit. “They came to Hong Kong just to obtain residency status, solely to conveniently travel to and from Hong Kong; to enrol their children in either schools for Hong Kong residents’ children in mainland China or in Hong Kong schools; or even to enjoy a tax rate for Hongkongers in mainland China,” he wrote. Angela, a graduate from a top mainland Chinese university, told HKFP that the TTPS provided her with a “convenient travel visa to Hong Kong.” She was living in Shenzhen, working in the investment sector, when she obtained a TTPS visa in early 2023. Angela never moved to Hong Kong, but she visited the city at least once a month for fun. Angela, in her 20s, said she was not interested in relocating across the border. “The living cost in Hong Kong is too high,” Angela said in Mandarin, “and I don’t have any network in Hong Kong.” When a headhunter offered her a new job in Shanghai a few months ago, Angela accepted it and moved there. “I forgot when my TTPS visa would expire, probably soon. Anyway, I won’t renew it,” Angela told HKFP. When Hong Kong leader John Lee announced the TTPS in October 2022, mainland China was still in the grip of strict Covid-19 pandemic restrictions. Amid years-long lockdowns and mandatory health checks, “Runology” – an online term referring to discussions on how to emigrate and “run away” overseas – became a popular topic on Chinese social media. Emma was living in Beijing at that time, working in the new media industry. She and her friends often shared information about emigration. “It was the time when everyone felt frustrated with a sense of crisis. We were not sure what would happen,” said Emma. She decided to apply for a TTPS visa because she believed she would easily fulfil the criteria. After all, she graduated with a bachelor’s degree from a top university in mainland China and a master’s degree from a university in Hong Kong. It’s like stockpiling food before the end of the world. And Hong Kong is the easiest to add to the pile. “It’s like stockpiling food before the end of the world, ” she said. “And Hong Kong is the easiest to add to the pile.” Within one week, her application was approved. However, China suddenly scrapped all its Covid-19 restrictions in early 2023. Having been able to keep her job in a new media outlet despite the economy slowdown, she decided to stay put. “Ultimately, Hong Kong is not very attractive to me,” Emma said. “And you can’t foresee any good development of the media industry in Hong Kong either.” She told HKFP that at least six of her friends also got TTPS visas, “but none of them actually went to Hong Kong or tried to look for a job there.” Lindsey said mainland Chinese who wished to emigrate would compare Hong Kong with other destinations like Singapore and Japan – the two countries that saw a rapid rise in Chinese immigrants over the past few years. As a businessperson, Lindsey found the industrial structure of Hong Kong “too homogeneous,” mainly relying on tourism and finance, whilst Singapore had more diverse industries, including manufacturing. She also said her business was well placed in Singapore as more Chinese consumer goods companies established offices in the city-state in their bid to enter Southeast Asian markets, bringing more clients to her consulting firm. In contrast, Lily – who, like Lindsey, is also in her late 30s – decided to move to Hong Kong because she said the city offered more opportunities for her two young children. A graduate of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, Lily obtained a TTPS visa in early 2023. Eight months ago, she moved to Hong Kong and set up an international trading company. Her husband and children would join her early next year. “My husband and I realised a long time ago that our children were not cut out for study,” Lily told HKFP in a café. “We just don’t want them to live like us again, to work so hard to get an enrolment to Sun Yat-sen University.” Lily said that most students in mainland China have “only one race lane” to succeed, which is the gruelling, highly competitive university entrance exams, known as gaokao. But if her kids become Hong Kong residents, there will be “three race lanes” for them to choose, said Lily. “They can apply to universities in Hong Kong with DSE [the city’s Diploma of Secondary Education], they can apply to universities in mainland China as Hong Kong residents, and they can also apply to foreign universities with results from Hong Kong exams.” Starting in 1985, Beijing provided a special mechanism for students from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese nationals to be enrolled in mainland Chinese universities, without having to compete in gaokao. Not long after Lily arrived in Hong Kong, sensing a high demand, she set up a group for mainland Chinese parents to provide them with information about not only schools in the city but also visa applications. Jesse Shang, a pro-establishment lawmaker who moved from mainland China to Hong Kong in 2011, concurred with Lily. He believed that one main motivation for mainland Chinese talent to stay in the city was to seek a better education for their children. Among those who came to Hong Kong, I would say two out of three were for their kids’ education. “Among those who came to Hong Kong, I would say two out of three were for their kids’ education,” he told HKFP in an interview, adding that the government should do more to assist new arrivals to enrol their children in school. David, who graduated from a top Chinese university, was working in the investment industry in Shanghai when the city went under a months-long Covid-19 lockdown in 2022. “We lived in a nice community in Shanghai, a middle-class one, and it was completely locked down for three months,” he recalled. “The entire community came to a standstill. We couldn’t even walk out of our home.” He and many other residents were frustrated, he said, “but we do not have any channels to say anything. It was futile.” Living under lockdown motivated him to leave mainland China. He was not interested in going abroad with his family, however. “Hong Kong is the best option for us because we are Chinese,” he told HKFP in Mandarin. Other factors included sending his children to Hong Kong schools and seeking new business opportunities in the city. In early 2023, David obtained a TTPS visa and switched jobs to work in the insurance industry. He became a Hong Kong-licensed insurance agent, with mainland Chinese customers as his main clientele. He currently runs a team of more than 50 insurance agents, most of whom are top university Chinese graduates working in Hong Kong on TTPS visas or other work visas. David still splits his time between Hong Kong and Shanghai, meeting potential customers in Shanghai and signing insurance contracts with clients in Hong Kong. He hopes his wife and child will join him in Hong Kong in one or two years. “I love outdoor activities, and in Hong Kong I enjoy a lot of hiking,” David said. “I suffer from rhinitis, and every time I arrive in Hong Kong, I feel better.” He is also learning Cantonese to settle better in Hong Kong. So far, the government has shrugged off the criticism against the TTPS. “I often compare talent matching to dating,” labour and welfare chief Chris Sun wrote on Facebook in early March. “If talent finds Hong Kong is suitable for them, they will stay; if they choose not to, it is normal to ‘break up peacefully.‘” It has been over two years since TTPS came into effect. According to Sun’s statement on Wednesday, nearly 10,000 TTPS visas will expire by June and the government will disclose visa extension data after that. “If [the number of] visa extensions is not ideal, I am afraid the public discourse will turn out to be negative, partly because those who do not choose to stay in Hong Kong tend to say bad things about the city,” Shang told HKFP. The lawmaker estimated that half of the 40,000 people who obtained TTPS visas in 2023 would not renew their visas. “Some just did not think it through when they applied, while some failed to secure a job even after they tried,” Shang said. If [the number of] visa extensions is not ideal, I am afraid the public discourse will turn out to be negative, partly because those who do not choose to stay in HK tend to say bad things about the city. He said talent which decided to stay should tell more good stories about the city. Shang said the city should improve its economic performance to attract talent from elsewhere, not just north of the border, because Hong Kong’s education system – an important pull factor for mainland Chinese parents – may not be enough for foreign parents. “Foreign professionals are not interested in Hong Kong’s education resources,” he said. “After all, our education goal is to send our kids [for higher education] to their countries in the US and Europe, right?” Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | Apps Help safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team Original reporting on HKFP is backed by our monthly contributors.

HKFP,506701,Independent Hong Kong filmmakers ‘forging new path’ with community screenings,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/03/15/independent-hong-kong-filmmakers-forging-new-path-with-community-screenings/,,,"Inside a cha chaan teng in Prince Edward district in Hong Kong, Stan Chan unfurled a large white cloth and hung it from the ceiling in front of a kitchen counter. The center of the room was cleared to make space for bright orange dining chairs, which were rearranged in rows facing the fabric. The Hong Kong-style restaurant was one of many unconventional venues where Chan had set up a screening for independent film The Perks of Being Wild. The one-hour feature, directed by Benson Koo, was never shown in cinema. Instead, Koo, Chan, and the rest of the production team at Wave Pictures criss-crossed the city to host 100 community screenings between last October and February this year. The film premiere was held in mid-October on a beach on Cheung Chau, the outlying island where the movie about childhood and friendship was shot in 2023. Between 20 and 30 people watched scenes of three boys idling on the beach during their summer vacation, projected onto a makeshift screen, occasionally interrupted by the sound of waves gently crashing on the beach. Chan, who was the sound designer for the film, earned a new title, “movie screener,” due to the sheer number of screenings he helped organise. The 40-year-old had to run around the city with a suitcase full of portable equipment, rushing from one screening to another, sometimes in the same day. Chan told HKFP in an interview in February that he was surprised by the age range of people who turned up at their events, which were mainly promoted on social media. “I was most surprised to see an elderly woman with a cane come to watch the film with her helper. After that, we met a dozen more elderly people, who said they came because a friend told them the film was very nostalgic,” Chan said in Cantonese. Filmmaker Koo was no stranger to showcasing his work in unusual places. In 2022, he directed a short film about the Cheung Chau Cinema, which had been largely abandoned and left to decay following its closure in 1997. Intrigued by the relationship between films and public spaces, Koo initially had an idea to host a screening inside the Grade III historic building. Due to safety concerns, however, he organised 20 screenings outside the pre-war cinema instead. When Koo completed The Perks of Being Wild, he and his crew decided to explore other possibilities beyond showcasing the film on a big silver screen. They wanted the film to be shown from one place to another, echoing the “vast growth of wild grass.” “We are not trying to resist the cinema industry. We just want to provide the public with another option for watching a film,” the 37-year-old director told HKFP. Apart from inviting people to enjoy his work in various community spaces, Koo also wanted to remove some cinema rules that he said had made watching films “way too serious.” At the start of each screening, audience would hear a sound recording telling them to “destroy your mobile phone” and asking them to “fart” during the show. These “rules” were set by the two young narrators, a pair of siblings who acted in the film. Koo’s team also asked participants to bring their own snacks or drinks, or to feel free to take the ones the team had prepared. The goal was to provide the audience, who were invited to donate some money – if they wished to do so, with a casual and enjoyable experience, the director said. The earnings from the 100 community screenings covered the film’s six-digit production cost, but they were not sufficient to pay the wages of Koo and the six crew members. When asked if he felt that the time and efforts spent on organising the screenings were cost-effective, Koo said it was “worth it” for the ideology behind it and the potential impacts such a film-screening model would have in the long run. “You may even say what we did over the last four months was stupid,” Koo said. “It was very exhausting, but we forged a new path.” For Koo, the film was an ode to the carefree days of his childhood. It also celebrated the beauty and rare serenity of Cheung Chau, a local tourist destination where he has resided since 2018. The director said he initially thought his film would end on a gloomy note, as the three main characters parted ways when their holiday was over, and one of them had to move abroad. During the filming process, however, Koo learned that the young actors had bid farewell to friends who had emigrated. The way they handled parting with ease changed his perspective and the tone of the film, the director said. “I always thought that grief from separation was something only experienced by adults. But the kids made peace with it so easily, and I realised that as adults, we can also face anything with such ease,” he said. After four months of visiting different corners of the city and meeting around 2,000 audience members, Koo and his team concluded their screening run at the director’s home on February 22, where they shot parts of the film. Sound designer Chan – who said he decided to quit the film industry because he found it taxing, both physically and mentally – brought his own guitar and performed songs from the film for the crowd. He would only “come out of retirement” when Koo begins a new filming project, Chan said. “I find myself unsuitable for film productions that involve dozens of people and millions of dollars. I was very lucky to have joined this crew, which made me realise that there are many ways to complete a project,” he said. Asked if the experience organising community screenings had taught him anything that could be passed on to other up-and-coming filmmakers, Koo said they should find their own path and not look back on or try to replicate the “golden era” of Hong Kong films. In an effort to promote independent film in the city, Wave Pictures is organising the Moving Cinema Film Festival next month to showcase short films and work by recent film graduates. The team led by Koo will collaborate with some of the venue providers they had worked with for the screenings of The Perks of Being Wild and turn unusual places into a mobile theatre again. It is an event open to anyone who is confident and brave enough to present their film, regardless of their background, Koo said. The only “criteria” is that the applicant must have watched his film to show that they have “good taste,” the director said jokingly. “I think we must have imagination. If the film industry is not doing so well now, we should not follow the paths taken by the previous generations,” Koo said. “We should create an era that belongs to us.” Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | Apps Help safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team Original reporting on HKFP is backed by our monthly contributors.

HKFP,499858,,https://hongkongfp.com/2024/12/21/innocent-mutanga-on-bringing-african-solutions-to-hong-kong-issues-and-why-empowerment-is-key-to-equality/,2024-12-21T10:00:00,,"Innocent Mutanga only had a few books, some money and clothes when he fled from Zimbabwe to Hong Kong in 2013 to escape political persecution. He had chosen this destination mainly for its visa-free entry, and as he described it, it was “Jackie Chan’s place.” Hong Kong was not an entirely foreign land to the Zimbabwean, who had watched many films set in the city before seeking refuge there. Upon arriving at the airport, however, Mutanga had no clear idea where to go next. The only place that came to mind was the historic police station in Yau Ma Tei, which he often saw in films about the local police force. Mutanga had intended to tell immigration officials that he would be staying in a hotel in the Kowloon neighbourhood. Instead, an officer asked if he was heading to Chungking Mansions. This was the first time he had heard of the building complex in Tsim Sha Tsui – an ethnic enclave brimming with shops, restaurants, and cheap accommodation – where he ultimately spent his early days as an asylum-seeker. After running out of money, Mutanga experienced a brief period of homelessness. At one point, he found himself sleeping in the kitchen of a guesthouse. He also helped paint another guesthouse in exchange for a roof over his head. Determined to find a way to stay in the city, the then-22-year-old spent hours each day researching Hong Kong’s refugee system. After perusing pages of documents provided by the Security Bureau to the Legislative Council, he discovered a pathway that few asylum-seekers had pursued: applying to become a tertiary student. “[Hong Kong] seems like my place. You have to constantly be moving and adapting, and adaptation is my strength,” Mutanga said in an interview with HKFP in September. Hong Kong allows refugees and asylum-seekers to pursue higher education in the city. To apply to tertiary institutions as a non-local applicant, they must obtain either a letter of no objection from the Immigration Department or a student visa or entry permit from the department. Between 2014 and 2020, a total of 49 letters of no objection were granted to asylum-seekers or refugees, according to an access to information request dated November 2020. It took Mutanga nearly two and a half years to gather all the necessary documents, including his results from the local university entrance examination. In July 2019, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Anthropology from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Earlier that year, Mutanga founded his own NGO – Africa Center Hong Kong – with the goal of “rebranding blackness” in Asia, fostering exchanges between different ethnic groups and promoting self-love within the African community. Mutanga, now in his early 30s, told HKFP that one of the centre’s core values is dignity. He cited his past experiences with other NGOs, where he felt compelled to “play the victim.” Some organisations would distribute meals to refugees while inviting the public to watch them eat, which he found demeaning. “They would look at us with all these pity faces… and when they were talking to us, they were very, very condescending,” Mutanga recalled. To build a sense of dignity among refugees, Mutanga said his NGO focuses on educating the children of refugees about what he calls “learned helplessness.” He believes they should not see themselves as victims but rather learn to “look forward to life” and become “masters of their own destiny.” Mutanga is now working at an investment bank and is eager to showcase the various career paths available for younger generations. The centre has organised talks featuring professionals such as nurses, firefighters, doctors, and pilots. Young refugees are also encouraged to take part in leadership programmes to further explore their potential. Beyond these talks, Mutanga said the NGO does not shy away from difficult conversations about racism. Young refugees and ethnic minority children are encouraged to share and discuss their experiences in schools and public spaces, while the organisers provide guidance on how to respond to those situations. In their efforts to “rebrand blackness,” the Africa Center founder and his team have been seeking to “bring African solutions to local issues.” Mutanga said Hong Kong needs more initiatives to “build community” to effectively address issues such as mental well-being, homelessness, and elderly care amid an aging population. The key was to make people “feel seen,” he said. “In Africa, community-building is what we know,” the Zimbabwean said. Mutanga, who was granted permanent residency in Hong Kong last month, was listed on the 2024 Zubin Foundation Diversity List. The list released in June is a directory of people from ethnic minority communities who demonstrated talent and commitment to serve on government advisory and statutory bodies. As a potential adviser for the government, Mutanga said the authorities have been too focused on integration of ethnic minority groups rather than empowerment. The danger of such an approach is that it could create “second-class citizens,” he said. While encouraging ethnic minority groups to learn Cantonese was “not a bad thing,” this measure does not appear effective in addressing the problems of stagnant wages and high student drop-out rate in the ethnic minority community, Mutanga said. Hong Kong Unison, an NGO that focuses on the equal rights and integration of ethnic minorities in the city, released a study in June that found the dropout rate for Nepalese students in Hong Kong was 7.1 per cent, compared with 0.4 per cent for the overall student population in the city. The disparity was “alarming,” the NGO said at the time. Mutanga said he would like to see more government resources allocated to empowerment, such as by identifying and cultivating the strengths of ethnic minority youth. “You don’t integrate first. You empower first and then you integrate. Then you create equal citizens,” he said.

HKFP,499322,,https://hongkongfp.com/2024/12/14/hong-kong-filmmaker-duo-on-citys-political-colours-and-winning-at-taiwans-golden-horse-awards/,2024-12-14T10:00:00,,"Growing up in Hong Kong, documentary makers Chan Cheuk-sze and Kathy Wong have come to understand colours as political symbols through the city’s pro-democracy movements over the past decade. In 2019, both were reporters covering the months-long protests and unrest. Hong Kong was then divided into political “colour camps” – pro-democracy protesters identified with yellow, while those on the pro-establishment side were labelled blue. That colour divide could be traced to the 2014 Umbrella Movement, in which protesters used colourful umbrellas to protect against police batons and tear gas, and later wore yellow ribbons to mark their political stance. But when Chan and Wong travelled to Taiwan – a self-ruled democracy which China claims as part of its territory – they found themselves in a place where colours carried vastly different political connotations. In January 2020, the pair were on a reporting trip in Taiwan, which was about to elect its president. At different rallies, candidates and their supporters wore vivid and distinctive colours that together made up the island’s political spectrum. “Tsai Ing-wen was green, Han Kou-yu was blue, and James Soong was orange,” Chan told HKFP in Cantonese, referring to the three candidates in the 2020 election and the respective colours of their political affiliations. “As we make reference to a colour, it also represents the political ideology behind a person,” she said on a video call from Taiwan, where she now studies film and art. Last month, the duo’s debut film Colour Sampling Ideology.mov – a 59-minute visual analysis of colours and politics in Hong Kong and Taiwan – won the best documentary short film category at the prestigious Golden Horse Awards. Their film followed a Hong Kong politician who visited the island to observe the 2020 vote, and whose political stance would be considered blue in Taiwan due to his affiliation with the Kuomintang (KMT), despite falling into the yellow camp in the Hong Kong context. In recent years, Hong Kong’s yellow camp has faded. Businesses once known for their pro-democracy stance have closed following frequent inspections from authorities citing anonymous complaints, and a once vibrant “yellow economic circle” has retreated from visibility. Protests and political opposition have been muted since a Beijing-imposed security law came into force in 2020, effectively quelling political dissent. Authorities say the law has restored order and stability to the city. Under the law, prominent democracy activists and ordinary citizens have been prosecuted. “While we see many political colours in Taiwan today, we don’t see them anymore in Hong Kong,” Wong, who studies political science in Taiwan, told HKFP a week after winning the Golden Horse Award. “The biggest feeling we have in Taiwan is that you can argue, you can at least fight for yourself. Whereas in Hong Kong, if you say you are yellow, people may not dare to talk further,” Wong said. Chan added: “Throughout our film, we are trying to say how to see light while in darkness.” In the days following their Golden Horse win, the pair were busy responding to people’s congratulatory messages, some of which thanked them for “speaking up for Hong Kong.” But Chan, a former creative media student and an aspiring artist, said this was never her intention. “We may not be the right people to speak up. To be honest, we are nobody,” she said. Initially they did not even consider competing for the award, concentrating instead on screening their film at Taiwan’s many independent bookstores. “There was a very pragmatic reason: we did not have money, we had no income,” Chan said. The screenings were “hard work,” with the pair having to lug around equipment and watch the film repeatedly, but Chan said they were also “the most fun” they ever had. “You never know who will come,” Chan said. “They may be interested in things completely unrelated to aesthetics and filmmaking. But it just makes you happy. It is a genuine exchange.” The film was motivated primarily by the pair’s discontent after moving to Taiwan – Wong arrived in 2021 and Chan joined a year later – where they found people had a limited understanding of their home city. “Hong Kong is just a failed case,” Wong said of how her political science classmates in Taiwan saw the city. “That’s their discourse.” “They would ask you about what is going on in Hong Kong … and I thought, why should I expose my trauma so casually while you don’t actually care.” To Chan, talking about her home to people in Taiwan inevitably ended in either side getting emotional. “The conclusion has always been that ‘you have suffered and we really wish to support Hong Kong’,” Chan said. “But an emotional conclusion is pointless.” “Are we doomed to depict 2019 as a story of Hongkongers’ suffering? … But it was never that simple,” she added. “It’s always been about how to tell the story of Hong Kong.” Golden Horse judges described Colour Sampling Ideology.mov as a “visual essay,” calling the film rigorous in its analysis and rich in political sensitivity. The film has various components documenting the major political colours in Hong Kong and Taiwan: red, green, blue, orange, and yellow. The pair followed the 2020 and 2024 Taiwanese presidential elections, as well as major court cases against pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, such as the one that saw 45 sentenced to up to 10 years behind bars for conspiring to commit subversion last month. Chan and Wong used an innovative narration method – by scanning printed images taken from their footage on a library scanner. Colours are ambiguous and politics is never simply black and white. The key is that you have the right to speak up, and others have the right to rebut… It is in such rowdy arguments that we experience freedom. Chan said the method allowed them to capture subtle differences in colours that may not be immediately recognisable to the human eyes. “The colours we know, the colours being perceived, and the colours being presented are all different. Colours have great tolerance,” she said, likening the method to “visual studies.” “And it is the same for political colours,” Wong added. The film attempts to document the nuances of people’s political stances hidden behind crude colour associations. A case in point is when two supporters at a rally for the KMT blue camp in the run-up to the 2020 Taiwanese presidential election quarrel over their different opinions on the protests in Hong Kong. One was on the side of the demonstrators – the yellow view – while the other was anti-protests – the blue view. “Colours are ambiguous and politics is never simply black and white,” Wong said. “The key is that you have the right to speak up, and others have the right to rebut… It is in such rowdy arguments that we experience freedom.” Despite their film being in part about Hong Kong, Chan and Wong said they had no plans to screen it in their home city. An amendment to Hong Kong’s Film Censorship Ordinance in 2021 enabled authorities to ban films deemed contrary to national security, and since then a number of independent films have failed to pass the city’s censors. See also: How Hong Kong film directors are navigating a new era of censorship Earlier this year, another of Chan’s films failed to pass authorities’ vetting and was withdrawn from a short film festival in the city, according to Ming Pao. “It will be a waste of time,” Chan said when asked if their award-winning documentary would be sent to censors in Hong Kong. That did not mean Hongkongers could not see the film, though, with the pair saying they had met many at screenings in Taiwan, most of them tourists from the city. Chan and Wong also received messages from fellow filmmakers, who told the pair that their acceptance speech had motivated them to continue creating. Upon receiving the award, the pair said: “When a place loses its colours… perhaps what we can do is to preserve the memory of its colourful past.” “Seeing Hong Kong requires new perspectives… and this is what every Hong Kong filmmaker has been working on,” Wong said. “You can see a momentum being built up. I believe there will be more new creations in the next few years,” she added. Chan hopes that Colour Sampling Ideology.mov will one day occupy a place in a catalogue of Hong Kong documentary films, alongside other titles such as Blue Island, Inside the Red Brick Wall, or even earlier unpublished materials about the city’s political movements. “Together they create a large folder, a folder that allows people to see what is Hong Kong.” Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | Apps Help safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team Original reporting on HKFP is backed by our monthly contributors.

HKFP,492574,,https://hongkongfp.com/2024/10/11/hong-kong-band-wellsaid-wanted-to-take-a-road-trip-with-distant-friends-they-turned-that-desire-into-an-album/,2024-10-11T10:00:00,,"Hong Kong band Wellsaid used to share a playlist named “imaginary road trip” with friends in the city and abroad, expressing regret at being unable to hit the road together during Covid. But even as borders reopened and the band could tour again, “there are people that we can’t see, for various reasons,” frontman Sum Lok-kei, known as Lok, said. “Willingly or unwillingly, people are separated, and only under these imaginary, hypothetical conditions can they actually do something together.” Without going into details, the four members of Wellsaid told HKFP their feelings about friends who had left the city or passed away. The unfulfilled road trip has been turned into a song with the same name as the playlist, which opens Wellsaid’s third full-length album, Regretopia. Despite the “quite heavy” nature of the topic, Lok said the song was “a lot more upbeat” – thanks to the collective song-writing process with bassist Dixon Chan, drummer Darryl Blacker, and guitarist Jackson Ng all involved. Wellsaid was formed in 2017 with Lok and Dixon as original members. After cycling through several departures, Darryl and Jackson joined in 2019, fixing Wellsaid as a four-piece outfit. They play music that may not speak directly to the city’s mainstream listeners – with lyrics written in English and a sound tinged with emo and punk sensitivity. In an interview with Still/Loud in 2019, Dixon said: “You go to one of our gigs – well, you’re looking at the whole scene already.” But that has changed with time. Speaking to HKFP in their band room in September, Dixon said the band certainly feels less lonely now. “Somehow we managed to gather a small circle around us,” he said. And with a bigger following, the band has changed, too. Imaginary Road Trip is its first-ever song to feature lyrics in Cantonese – an idea that was put to Lok by his longtime friend, Taiwanese singer-songwriter Hom Shen-hao. “He was like: ‘Now that you’re trying to write songs for the people around you, rather than just for yourself, why don’t you sing in a different language so that the people around you could understand better?’” Lok, who is also the band’s chief lyricist, recalled. The new album is Wellsaid’s most ambitious project to date. Compared with their 2022 album Lurking, which was recorded sporadically in Hong Kong during the pandemic, the band completed the nine-track Regretopia in roughly a year and a half. They even flew to Taiwan twice to record the album – thanks to another long-time friend of Lok’s who engineered the tracks. “What I wanted to do with this album is to stretch what it means to be Wellsaid’s music,” Lok said. Regretopia is divided by an interlude – a gritty guitar rings out against ambience created by sound artist Brian Chu. The track closes with a male voice saying he has just landed, and telling whoever listening not to worry about him. That voice belongs to Hong Kong musician Jabin Law, who has moved to the UK. Lok said he invited Jabin to “recreate” the voice message he sent to his family after arriving and that bolstered the album’s theme. Immediately after the interlude is a track titled Like Water in Water, a much slower song compared with others on the album. The band said the track, along with the faster, upbeat Imaginary Road Trip, served as the record’s “goalposts” and were the first two songs written for the album. “I think that really sets the main tone of the album,” Lok said. “Sonically and content-wise, this is where we’re heading… it’s kind of lucky that we just landed two songs that are pretty significant to us.” Lok said that whereas he used to write songs about how he felt, this time he wanted the lyrics to be about the people around him. “During Covid and the protests [in 2019], there are moments where I feel like we are connected to a collective consciousness,” he said. “A shared pain,” Dixon added. Across nine tracks, Wellsaid touches on private feelings about departure and death, and also the collective experience of living in an online environment, where attention-seeking behaviour and problematic speech are the norm. In short, the album was about “living in 2024,” Lok said, jokingly. That also encapsulates how the band approaches making music. “Just like when we’re doing Lurking, it was basically a timestamp of where we were around that time of writing and recording the music,” Dixon said. “It’s just a natural way of how we make music.” This time around, the band’s members also have more understanding of each other when it comes to making music, they said. “We grew a lot in the couple of years leading up to this album,” said drummer Darryl. “We wrote the songs more organically… we formed the ideas together.” Their collective efforts can be heard in the songs. In several tracks there are multiple voices other than those of lead singer Lok and backing vocalist Darryl. Those voices belong to the many friends involved in the project, such as Hong Kong indie singer 611, as well as Hom, who just happened to visit the band as they were recording in Taipei. “I feel like a lot of the things that we do are enabled by our friends anyway, so it makes sense to have them involved,” Lok said. Even the album name arose from a chat Lok had with friend and musician Leung Wing-lai after a gig. “I was telling him how I feel about performing the songs… he’s like, ‘you have a disease of regret. You have a regret disease. You’re always thinking about the thing you’ve just done!’” Lok said. “I think I was going to Japan, and on the bus to the airport, I was like, ‘regretopia,’ that’d be a good name.” Lok continued: “We feel like we’re always living in a state where you’re… kind of regretful, not of what you’ve done, but of what collectively this world has become. Because it could have been nice. That’s what makes you regret, [because] it could have been different.” The recording in Taipei was enhanced by the album’s producer Wilmer Chan, who the band said “just knows when to push our buttons.” “[Wilmer] is the exterior ear, but with the knowledge to understand where we’re coming from,” Darryl said. “I keep saying this – if Wilmer says it’s good, then it’s fucking awesome. If he says it’s okay, then it’s still pretty good,” Lok added. During two sessions in the Taipei studio – recorded with a six-month gap in between – local friends and musicians dropped by. One of them brought Wellsaid some extra gear – and bubble tea. Another came with their newborn baby. As Jackson was recording his guitar solo, there was “a whole cheer team outside,” Dixon recalled. The move to record in Taiwan was costly, creating a sense of urgency that pushed them to make the songs on time and get the recordings right within each session. “It was stressful, but also very wholesome,” Lok said. “It just feels like you’re among good people.” In the 2019 interview, Wellsaid had just regrouped with Darryl and Jackson joining. Their peers in the local indie scene were going into hiatus or disbanding for good. At that time the band said: “We’re going to outlive them all.” “That is still the plan,” Lok said, noting the ambitious goal was made when departure and demise felt inevitable in Hong Kong’s independent music scene. But in recent years, young bands have been emerging and making “exciting music,” he said. Meanwhile, Wellsaid has grown like a “family business,” Lok said, with each member having a role. For example, Dixon handles the band’s visuals while Lok looks after the money, or, as he put it, “many Excel spreadsheets.” See also: ‘Tomorrow never knows’ – Hong Kong indie collective seeks community, history for the city’s alternative music scene For newer members Darryl and Jackson, the band is important for the friendships as much as the music. Jackson said joining the band was an opportunity to rekindle his love for music, after his previous post-rock band dissolved. “Playing music was a passion then, now it is a necessity,” he said. It was the same for Darryl, who moved to Hong Kong in 2017, thinking at the time that he would take a break from music and focus on his career as a chef. “I could have ended up in… a fucking gweilo band,” he said, using the Cantonese slang term for white people in the city. “I would have been doing that just to get my fulfilment of playing some music.” Instead, he joined Wellsaid and became best friends with the members, adding that they share the same music taste – as well as love for hotpot. “We didn’t just grow as musicians. We’ve grown a lot together as friends, as men, and as adults… we’ve seen a lot of changes together,” the drummer said. “I’m in a band with my friends. We go on tour, we write records together, and we hang out. That’s like the coolest thing for me.” Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | Apps Help safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team Original reporting on HKFP is backed by our monthly contributors.

HKFP,99628,,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/04/01/hkfp-history-spectacular-shots-from-the-final-days-of-hong-kongs-old-kai-tak-airport/,,,"Heralded as the sixth most dangerous in the world, Kai Tak served as Hong Kong’s airport from 1925 until 1998. Initially a simple grass-strip airfield, a concrete slipway was added in 1928. A flight control tower and hangar were built in the 1930s, when commercial flights began. The airport was expanded in the 1950s with a new runway on land reclaimed from the harbour. By the 1990s, night flight curfews, building restrictions in Kowloon, pollution and noise forced the colonial government to seek an alternative location to replace the ageing airport. On July 6, 1998, a small ceremony celebrating the end of the airport was held inside the control tower after a final Cathay flight flew from Kai Tak to the new airport at Chek Lap Kok. Richard Siegel, the then-director of civil aviation, famously said “Goodbye Kai Tak, and thank you” as he switched off the runway lights for the last time. Its airport codes were transferred to the new airport on Lantau. Today, the site is home to a cruise ferry terminal. Below are shots from AFP photographers documenting the final days of Kowloon City’s iconic old airport.

HKFP,339124,,https://hongkongfp.com/2024/03/05/hkfp-guide-peng-chau-a-quiet-rustic-green-antidote-to-hong-kongs-inner-city-stress/,2024-03-05T00:05:00,,"The delightful island of Peng Chau is an effective antidote to inner-city exhaustion. A day spent exploring, sunbathing and hiking will leave you feeling like you’ve just been on a relaxing holiday – especially if you go midweek. Located just 30 to 40 minutes by ferry from Central (depending on whether you take the slow or fast one), Peng Chau is easily walkable, offers incredible views, quiet, private spots to soak in the sun and enjoy the sea breeze, and a beautiful landscape of gardens and greenery. With several secluded, soft-sand beaches, rambling paths for hikes, garden walks and breath-taking city views, you may have a hard time deciding what to do first. Exploring the entire island takes no more than a couple of hours, and it’s easy to do. If you’re keen on cycling, there are a few bike rental places offering options to hire one for the day, and the beaches are great for camping. Peng Chau means “flat island,” so the name alone tells you navigating won’t be too hard, but don’t be fooled – there are a couple of steep hills and steps along some of the pathways. However, none is too extreme and even families with children can manage. Take the Peng Chau ferry from Central Ferry Pier 6. Timetables can be found here. The fast ferry is always preferable but because Peng Chau isn’t that far, the slow ferry is also acceptable. Whether you’re hoping to do a long hike or just a short walk, there are a couple of options from which to choose. We started by going left off the ferry, where you will see bike racks and an oddly placed outdoor “gym” area (complete with stationary bikes and even a rowing machine spaced out along the promenade). You’ll pass the waterfront Treasure Cove villas, which may have you questioning whether city dwelling really is the way to live, and eventually you’ll see the circular garden area where the small Seven Sisters temple (Chek Tset Temple) is located. Keep walking towards the North Peng Chau Walking Trail and Peng Yu Path. Soon you’ll see the signs for Peng Yu Path and Old Fisherman’s Rock Lookout Pavilion. Take that path upward (the path is paved). As you round each corner, stunning views and secluded beaches surprise you, each one better than the next. Keep following the path – there are a few stop-and-see spots with incredible city views on a clear day, as well as a tiny pavilion along the route – and when you get to the fork in the road, go left towards the village. While walking in the village area, make sure to stop and enjoy the various banana and papaya trees planted alongside the path, while also checking out the vegetable gardens. Eventually you’ll come back down to the water and Tung Wan barbecue area. Keep going but take the first right onto He King Street back towards the village. This is where you can decide if you are finished with your stroll or want to keep exploring (we say opt for the latter). Go past the Peng Chau Kam Fa Temple, and when you get to Peng Chau Wing On Street, make a left. Follow along the alleyway but keep an eye out for the hand-painted signs that say Room for Rent and Shery’s Leather Factory, which are hung over a little doorway. Make sure you go through that alleyway, because what awaits you is the best part of this village. Beautiful and quirky artwork adorn the walkway, so keep your camera at the ready as you exit to a hidden little street where the former leather factory is situated. The area has been transformed into a gorgeous garden, complete with a café and a few antique shops. This spot is not to be missed. If you’re ready to take on the other half of the island, head back where you came from and find your way back towards the pier. Once on the main drag, go left (if you’re just getting off the ferry, this would be on the right) and walk toward the delicately manicured garden area on the waterfront side. Take a rest at one of the many benches or keep going towards the signs for Finger Hill. Follow the signs for Nam Shan Road and head upwards – a bit of a steep stretch here. Soon in the distance you’ll see Finger Hill, which seems like it will be a huge climb but it’s really just a matter of going up a long flight of stairs. It won’t be hard for the avid hiker, and we saw elderly people mastering the steps with ease. While climbing the stairs make sure to stop and turn around because the view from the staircase is better than the view from the top. When we were there the top view was blocked in part by overgrown trees. Coming back into town is just as simple as the way you came, but you can also take the option to turn left at the bottom of the steps and continue on the Peng Chau Family Walk back towards the pier. It also offers a peek into village life and will take you to a few more beautiful beach spots with a stellar view of Hong Kong and Kowloon on a clear day. Even if you decide not to follow these suggested routes, the island’s infrastructure has made wandering simple and a lot of fun, and discovering what lies ahead is what makes this place so special. If you still haven’t had your fill of exploring, a bridge will take you to the tiny island of Tai Lei, which has a small beach and some good spots for taking snapshots. You can get there by making a left instead of going onto Peng Yu Path after the Seven Sisters Temple. Peng Chau is similar to most islands, with various shops and alleyways selling everything from fruit and vegetables, fresh seafood, meat and other grocery items, as well as the usual backpacker items (elephant pants, anyone?) There are local eateries and other restaurants, but if you’re hoping for more variety, taking a 10-minute ferry to Discovery Bay is just as simple. The pier for Discovery Bay and Mui Wo is just to the right side of the pier to Central. For such a tiny island there are quite a few temples to see. There are clearly marked signs but the first is the most obvious – Tin Hau Temple – just off the ferry pier to the right. Others include the Kam Fa Temple, Lung Mo Temple and the Seven Sisters Temple. There are quite a few places to eat on Peng Chau, but operating hours vary, so make sure to check before you go.

HKFP,405554,,https://hongkongfp.com/2022/11/16/hkfp-guide-hong-kongs-new-govt-run-online-booking-system-for-twisk-campsite/,2022-11-16T08:00:00,,"All 41 designated campsites in Hong Kong under the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) will finally reopen after being closed for more than two years owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. As members of the public are allowed to set up tents again at specific sites in the city’s country park areas starting on Thursday, the government also launched an online booking system pilot scheme for the Twisk Campsite in Tai Lam Country Park to allow advance reservation of camping spots. HKFP explains how to navigate the booking site. Twisk Campsite is located in Tai Lam Country Park near Tai Mo Shan, the highest peak in Hong Kong. You can take Bus 51 (Sheung Tsuen-bound) from Nina Tower Bus Terminus in Tsuen Wan and get off at “Tai Mo Shan Country Park.” From there, it is a five-minute walk before you arrive at the campsite entrance. Both Hong Kong residents and non-residents are allowed to book a free camping space at the Twisk Campsite. You will be asked to indicate your residential status when you make your reservation. The reservation system is only available to adults, however, as the system asks you to confirm that you are 18 or above on the check-in day. The entire Twisk Campsite is divided into five zones with 37 camping units in total – four of them are twin units. A single camping space can accommodate one to four people, while a twin unit holds five to eight people. The government may adjust the maximum number of people allowed per camping unit based on the latest Covid-19 social distancing measures. On the online booking system, you can reserve a camping space for up to two nights, and each applicant can book one unit only. It is possible for campers to extend their stay at the same or a different unit by making another booking for one or two nights after they have checked in. You can stay in the campsite for a maximum of four consecutive nights, subject to the availability of the units. Yes. Once you have selected the dates of your reservation, the system will show you an overview of all the 37 camping units on site. The map also indicates the proximity of individual units to public facilities in the campsite, such as the shelter, water supply, toilets, refuse collection points and the guard house. Units that are still available will be in green, while the red ones mean they are already taken. Once you have selected the unit you want, the system shows you the location of the unit within its zone, as well as the size and facilities included. For instance, Unit 25, a single unit located at the corner of Zone 3, has a square camping platform that is three metres wide and three metres long. It also comes with a table and bench with a barbeque stove. Campers are allowed to check in between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. Those who arrive after 6 p.m. would be considered “no-show.” Campsite users are required to check out by 11 a.m. on the check-out date. Note that the Twisk Campsite is closed for maintenance and cleaning every Wednesday except if it is a public holiday. After you have chosen you desired camping unit, you are required to fill in your name, as shown on your identification document, your identification document number, email address, mobile number and the total number of people who will be camping at the unit. You have to complete the form in 15 minutes. Notes to Campers by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department by HKFP on Scribd You are not allowed transfer your booking to other people. Any fellow campers who are a minor must obtain approval from their parents or guardians to join the camping. Successful applicants receive a confirmation email. When you check in at the Twisk Campsite Service Counter, you will need to present the confirmation email as well as your identity document. You will collect a “Camper Card” from the counter, which you need to display on the camping platform at all times during your stay. People without a valid card or anyone who fails to be idenitified by a valid cardholder will be asked to leave the campsite. The “Camper Cards” should be returned to the counter or a drop box upon check-out. Yes. You can use the camping gear rental service at the Twisk Campsite Service Counter if you do not have equipment needed for your stay. You will be asked to pay a deposit and sign an agreement. You can cancel your reservation either through the online booking system or in person at the Twisk Campsite Service Counter. If you want to make amendments to your booking, such as changing the date, camping unit or the name of the applicant, you can only cancel your book and submit a new one. The unit you give up will be shown on the booking system as available after midnight on the day of cancellation.

HKFP,505201,,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/03/01/explainer-hong-kongs-national-security-crackdown-month-56/,2025-03-01T10:30:00,,"In the second month of 2025, more groups decided to halt their activities in Hong Kong, a city once known for its vibrant civil society. The Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (PORI) announced it would stop self-funded research and may even shut down, while the 30-year-old Democratic Party said it was taking steps to disband. Meanwhile, the government proposed legal amendments to tighten trade union laws, citing national security reasons. We also learned that the verdict of the national security trial of jailed media tycoon Jimmy Lai, which began last November, was expected to be handed down in October. The Democratic Party, Hong Kong’s largest opposition group, announced on February 20 that it would set up a special task force to discuss steps to disband. Following a two-hour meeting with the executive committee, the party’s chairperson Lo Kin-hei told journalists that the three-member task force would handle legal and financial matters relating to the dissolution and liquidation of the 30-year-old party. He said that the committee had considered the “overall political environment” in making its decision.The motion to dissolve the party would be subject to a vote by party members at a general meeting, Lo added. The 400-strong party will officially disband if more than three-quarters of party members attending the meeting support the motion. “Developing democracy in Hong Kong is always difficult, especially over the past few years,” he told journalists. “We see a lot of civil society groups or political parties disbanding or dissolving.” Multiple members of the party have been jailed or detained over national security offences, including Helena Wong and Lam Cheuk-ting, as well as former chairs Wu Chi-wai and Albert Ho. The Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (PORI) announced on February 13 that it would suspend all self-funded research and may “even close down.” The news came just weeks after its CEO, Robert Chung, was investigated twice by national security police. Chung was first taken in for questioning on January 13, the same day the PORI office was raided. He was taken in a second time on January 27. The series of questioning and the raid came after PORI’s former deputy CEO Chung Kim-wah, currently in the UK, was added to a wanted list in December 2024 over alleged violations of Beijing-imposed national security law. PORI will “suspend all its self-funded research activities indefinitely, including regular tracking surveys conducted since 1992, as well as all feature studies recently introduced,” the polling organisation said in a statement. “HKPORI will undergo a transformation or even close down,” while CEO Chung “welcomes interested parties to take over the Institute,” the statement said. “HKPORI has always been law-abiding, but in the current environment, it has to pause its promotion of scientific polling.” Launched in July 2019, PORI is the successor of the University of Hong Kong’s Public Opinion Programme (POP), which was established in 1991. The Hong Kong government and former lawmaker Ted Hui exchanged a war of words in February. On February 17, Hui posted on Facebook to slam a court order allowing HK$800,000 of assets to be confiscated from him and his family members. Hui, who is now based in Australia and is wanted by Hong Kong’s national security police, said that the High Court had issued an order to confiscate assets held by his mother and wife in Hong Kong, as well as trust money held by a Hong Kong law firm that represented him in court. His Facebook post also included a screenshot of the court’s confiscation order, made under the 2020 Beijing-imposed national security law. Hui said the order, dated February 17, was “absurd” and amounted to a “violation of human rights.” In response, Hong Kong’s government issued a statement, condemning “the unfounded smear and malicious attacks online.” Hui transferred HK$2.5 million in personal assets as gifts to his mother and wife before, and after, he “absconded” from Hong Kong, according to the statement. Hong Kong issued an arrest warrant against Hui in July 2023, after the former lawmaker fled the city in 2020. A total of 19 people overseas, including Hui, are wanted by the Hong Kong police over national security offences. His passport was cancelled last December under the city’s homegrown security law. Hong Kong police took in three relatives of ex-district councillor Carmen Lau, who is wanted for allegedly breaching the national security law, to aid an investigation. National security police took away Lau’s 66-year-old uncle and 63-year-old-aunt from their residence in Tai Wai on February 10, local media reported. They were reportedly brought to Sha Tin Police Station. The police said confirmed to HKFP that “the National Security Department of the Police Force brought two individuals to the police station to assist in the investigation.” One week later, in the morning of February 17, another female relative of Lau was brought to Tuen Mun Police Station to assist with an investigation into the activist, local media also reported. Lau, who currently lives in the US, according to her X account, said she had learned that “another distant family member” was taken in for “interrogation” by the national security police. A member of the now-disbanded Civic Party, Lau was among six Hongkongers named in a fresh round of arrest warrants last December, with HK$1 million bounties offered for information leading to their arrests. She stands accused of inciting secession and colluding with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security. The Hong Kong government proposed legislative amendments to permanently bar those convicted of national security offences from serving in labour unions and to require all foreign funding to be vetted by the authorities. The changes to the Trade Unions Ordinance were “to better fulfil the duty of safeguarding national security” under the city’s two national security laws, the labour authorities said in a statement published on February 19. The amendments would also “strengthen the statutory powers of the Registrar of Trade Unions over the supervision and regulation of trade unions,” the statement said. Under the government’s proposal, trade unions shall not receive overseas funding “unless approved by the Registrar.’ The government also proposed empowering the Registrar of Trade Unions to bar those convicted of national security offences from serving as union officers or promoters for union applications, and to refuse applications for registering unions on national security grounds, with no possibility of appeal. The applicants also cannot appeal to the court against the decision. The proposal will be tabled to the legislature in April. Hong Kong activist Lau Ka-tung, whose social work licence was suspended for five years, received a warning from a licensing body in February that describing himself as a “social worker” or “former social worker” might violate the law. In a letter sent to Lau, the Social Workers Registration Board said it noticed on February 4 that Lau called himself an “independent social worker handling social movement cases” on his personal Facebook account. The licensing body also pointed out that in a social media post, dated December 29, Lau described himself as a “former social worker.” “Please pay attention, if a person whose name does not appear on the Register continues to use the title ‘independent social worker handling social movement cases,’ ‘former social worker,’ or any other relevant titles, the person might violate the Ordinance,” the letter read in Chinese. Lau, who was jailed over an offence linked to a protest in 2019, announced on December 29 that the Social Workers Registration Board had suspended his social work licence for five years. It was the longest revocation yet under new laws aimed at protecting national security. A verdict for Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai’s national security trial is expected in October, the Hong Kong High Court heard in a separate proceeding over the newspaper’s winding up on February 23. Lai’s trial, which began in November, continued in February. On February 4, three Hong Kong judges asked the jailed media tycoon to calm down and restrict himself to answering questions after he issued a fiery criticism against prosecutors in the witness box. On February 7, Lai denied lying in court about not knowing about an international group critical of mainland China, despite having promoted the launch of the organisation in his now-shuttered Apple Daily tabloid five years ago. On February 19, Lai denied condoning violent protest despite urging solidarity between demonstrators in 2019. The 77-year-old also told the court that his calls for amnesty were not at odds with his stance against violence. Lai has pleaded not guilty to two conspiracy charges of collusion with foreign forces under the Beijing-imposed national security law, and a third of conspiring to publish “seditious” materials under a colonial-era law. He could be jailed for life if convicted. Former opposition lawmaker Albert Ho may plead guilty in the subversion case against the now-disbanded group that was behind the city’s Tiananmen crackdown vigil for three decades. Ho’s lawyer, Erik Shum, told three High Court judges on February 20 that the veteran pro-democracy politician intended to change his plea and was “in touch” with the prosecution. Ho, former chairperson of the Democratic Party, previously indicated that he would plead not guilty. Ho, Lee Cheuk-yan and Chow Hang-tung – formerly of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China – were charged alongside the alliance itself with inciting subversion of state power under the Beijing-imposed national security law. They could be jailed for life if convicted. Judge Alex Lee – one of the three judges presiding over the case – also further delayed the start of their trial to November due to scheduling conflicts with the national security trial of media tycoon Jimmy Lai. A 26-year-old childcare assistant, identified as Ng Shuk-wai, was arrested by the Hong Kong national security police on February 8, two days after taxi driver Yu Hin-lam, 26, was apprehended by police. Yu was accused of aiding the escape attempts of four Hongkongers who faced charges related to the 2019 protests and unrest and spent two years hiding in safehouses, according to local media. The prosecution identified Yu as Ng’s boyfriend and said that the pair worked together as lookouts for the four fugitives and provided food for them. Both had been charged with perverting the course of justice and denied bail. Perverting the course of justice does not have a maximum punishment, with the courts given discretion to impose any imprisonment term or fine depending on the severity of the offence. Cases heard at District Court carry a maximum jail sentence of seven years. The Hong Kong government condemned “baseless allegations” and “smearing” of its two security laws after US politicians introduced a resolution on February 27, criticising perceived rights abuses in the city. Idaho Senator Jim Risch, chair of the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a committee member, introduced the resolution to “condemn the Chinese government for its destruction of Hong Kong’s autonomy through the 2020 ‘national security law’ and the 2024 ‘Article 23 Ordinance,’” according to a statement. In response, a Hong Kong government statement slammed the “despicable political manoeuvring and reckless clamouring.” As of February 1, a total of 318 people had been arrested for “cases involving suspected acts or activities that endanger national security” since Beijing’s national security law came into effect, according to the Security Bureau. The number includes those arrested under Article 23, known officially as the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance. Of the 184 people and five companies who have so far been charged, 161 people and one company have been convicted or are awaiting sentencing. Among them, 91 people and four companies have been charged under the national security law, with 76 convicted. Five people have been charged under Article 23, three of whom have been convicted. HKFP has reached out to the Security Bureau for updated figures. Provides context or background, definition and detail on a specific topic.

HKFP,504891,,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/02/22/explainer-hong-kongs-democratic-party-through-the-years-from-its-founding-to-looming-end/,2025-02-22T09:51:15,,"Hong Kong’s Democratic Party said on Thursday that it would begin steps to disband, citing the political situation. The party, the city’s largest opposition group, marked its 30th anniversary last year. It counts some of the city’s most well-known opposition figures among its ranks – including its co-founder Martin Lee, nicknamed the “Father of Democracy.” “We can sustain the party’s survival for a while if we only look at our account book,” said party chair Lo Kin-hei on Thursday night. “But all in all, I think that is a decision that we made… we consider the overall political environment in Hong Kong and all those future plans that we can foresee.” Since Beijing imposed a national security law in Hong Kong in 2020, dozens of political and civil society groups have dissolved. The pro-democracy Civic Party, then the city’s second-largest opposition party in the Legislative Council (LegCo), officially folded in March 2024. The Democratic Party, seen as a moderate liberal party with less radical views than its localist counterparts, used to have regular meetings with government officials and maintained a significant representation in LegCo. But its influence has dimmed in recent years. While the government used to consult the Democratic Party among other political parties for policy planning, it has been years since it has done so. The Democratic Party currently counts around 400 people among its members, down from around 1,000 in “around 2008 or 2009,” Lo told HKFP on Friday. The proposal to disband will now go to a vote among members. The party will dissolve if at least 75 per cent of members present vote in favour. Ahead of that, HKFP looks back at the Democratic Party over the years, its key figures, and where some of the former lawmakers are today. The Democratic Party was founded in 1994, at the time when the British colony was facing uncertainty ahead of its 1997 return to mainland China. The political party was a merger of two opposition groups, United Democrats of Hong Kong and Meeting Point. Along with other opposition groups, the party advocated for the city’s democratisation, calling for the legislature and the chief executive to be elected by the public in post-Handover Hong Kong – instead of elite voters who mostly had pro-Beijing views. A third political party, then-lawmaker Emily Lau’s The Frontier, merged with the Democratic Party in 2008. The party’s manifesto states that it is “necessary to speed up the development of a democratic system of government to strengthen the protection of freedom, human rights, and the rule of law.” The manifesto also states at the outset that Hong Kong is an “indivisible part of China” and that the party supports the return of Hong Kong’s sovereignty to China. The Democratic Party has no consensus on policies concerning same-sex marriage, but most lawmakers have been known to support the equal rights of same-sex couples. In a LegCo meeting in 2018 about whether the government should consider enacting policies for same-sex couples to enter into a legal union, all but one of the Democratic Party’s lawmakers who spoke were in favour. In a motion moved by a pro-Beijing lawmaker in 2016 calling on the government to “combat ‘bogus refugees'” and set up holding centres for asylum seekers, all Democratic Party members voted against. The Democratic Party was not without its infighting. After the Handover in 1997, a rift emerged between two camps in the party: the “mainstreamers” and the “Young Turks.” The former was led by veteran democrats like Yeung Sum and Lee Wing-tat, while the latter – known for more radical views – were led by activists including Tsang Kin-shing, known as “the Bull,” and Andrew To. The two camps differed on issues such as minimum wage, with the Young Turks advocating a more pro-labour position that advocated for a minimum wage policy. The Young Turks accused the mainstreamers of not sharing their power, and some like Tsang and To left the party and founded the League of Social Democrats in 2006. Martin Lee, known as the “Father of Democracy,” is one of the party’s key figures. A barrister and founder of the United Democrats, he was a founding member, and the first chairperson, of the Democratic Party. Szeto Wah, a teacher who also co-founded the United Democrats and the Democratic Party, remained in activism until he lost his cancer battle in 2011. Both Lee and Szeto were lawmakers. Also among its key figures is Albert Ho, who chaired the party from 2006 to 2012. A former lawmaker, he ran in the chief executive election in 2012 as the party’s first member to run in the small-circle leadership race. Competing against two pro-Beijing candidates, he finished last. Ho is currently held in custody awaiting a national security trial linked to his role in the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Democratic Movements of China, the Tiananmen vigil organiser group that he also led. Lau, founder and convenor of The Frontier, joined the Democratic Party in 2008 and became its chairperson from 2012 to 2016. She is one of the party’s few leading figures who still make public appearances and comments on politics. She has been seen attending national security court hearings and also hosts a YouTube talk show called “ChatDP with Emily Lau,” interviewing activists and government advisers, among others. During the first LegCo elections in 1995 after the party’s formation, the Democratic Party emerged as the largest party, seizing 19 out of the 60 seats. A dozen of those were in the geographical constituencies, in which the public has a vote. The term, however, lasted less than two years as Beijing installed an interim legislature after the 1997 Handover, which the Democratic Party criticised as undemocratic and boycotted. The city held its first post-Handover elections in 1998. Despite internal friction, the Democratic Party as the largest opposition party still won a significant number of seats in the LegCo geographical constituencies. It won nine out of the 20 seats in the geographical constituencies, more than any other party. In 2000, the Democratic Party got nine publicly elected seats. In both 2004 and 2008, it got seven. However, the party’s performance suffered in the 2012 elections amid the rise of newer opposition groups. That year, the Democratic Party lost its title as the opposition party with the most publicly elected seats for the first time. The Civic Party won five seats, one more than the Democratic Party. The Labour Party and People Power, a localist party, each took three publicly elected seats. See also: Explainer: Hong Kong’s Election Committee determines who leads the city – what is it and how does it work? In the 2016 elections, the Democratic Party and the Civic Party tied for seats. The Democratic Party did not run in the 2021 LegCo elections, the city’s first polls after a “patriots only” electoral overhaul. It no longer has any representatives in the Legislative Council or on the District Council. The Democratic Party had seven members in the legislature between 2016 and 2020, the last legislative term before the “patriots only” electoral overhaul: Ted Hui, Helena Wong, Wu Chi-wai, Andrew Wan, Lam Cheuk-ting, James To and Roy Kwong. Besides Hui, who left the city in late 2020, all of them were arrested under the national security law in 2021 over their participation in the legislative primaries. These were held by the democratic camp to decide who best to run in the 2020 elections before they were postponed due to Covid-19. Wong, Wu, Wan and Lam are serving jail time after they were convicted last year. To and Kwong were not charged. Both of them appear to have retired from politics, although Kwong continues to make commentary videos on YouTube about current affairs. During a press conference about suggestions for the upcoming annual budget address on Wednesday, Lo, the party chairperson, said the last time they were invited to meet with officials to discuss the budget or policy address was 2019. Asked by HKFP how the party’s relationship with the government had changed over the years, Lo said: “I can’t say there is really some sort of relationship, because there is no face-to-face discussion with them… this is difficult and I think, I truly hope the government can be more open to different groups of people.” Provides context or background, definition and detail on a specific topic.

HKFP,469959,,https://hongkongfp.com/2024/02/03/hkfp-yum-cha-hong-kong-neon-artist-chankalun-on-bending-the-rules/,2024-02-03T10:00:00,,"The image of Hong Kong’s neon-lit streetscapes is, like the signs that lent their glow to those cinematic scenes, largely a thing of the past. But although bureaucracy has stripped many buildings of their illuminated adornments and left just a handful of neon masters to ply the dying trade, there are others dedicated to keeping the craft alive. Artist Chankalun is one of them. With a background in museum and set design, Chankalun, who is also known as Karen Chan, told HKFP’s Yum Cha podcast that she had always had a penchant for the “theatrical.” It was from a typically out-of-the-box idea that her passion for neon emerged. “I organised and curated a group neon art exhibition called “My Life, My Hood” [in a car park]… basically trying to demonstrate how different artists are portraying Hong Kong or a very dear neighbourhood to them with an accent of neon,” Chankalun said. “Just like how neon is decorating our streets,” she added. To help the artists add that accent of neon, Chankalun enlisted one of the city’s last neon masters, Wong Kin-wah, to offer a basic workshop. “That’s actually how I know how difficult it is to manipulate glass with fire,” she said with a laugh. It did not put her off pursuing neon as a medium, though. “I think maybe I love challenges,” she added. Apple | Spotify | Overcast | Amazon Music | Pandora | YouTube | RSS The next challenge came when trying to find a neon master who would teach her. “I got rejected by the community here,” Chankalun said. Still, she persevered, finding a glass artist who was willing to help, despite never having tried neon bending. “He was watching YouTube videos the day before he taught me,” she said. “That was when I started to like this medium,” Chankalun continued, drawing a similarity between Chinese calligraphy and neon. “You can shape it in the way you want, but once you kind of fuck it up… you can’t do much about it, but it can also be part of your expression. Kind of like Chinese calligraphy, where [you] would value expressions or even mistakes more than perfection.” Chankalun’s persistence – and her willingness to make mistakes – paid off, and in 2019 her first ever neon creation was installed at Wonderfruit festival in Thailand. That was just Chankalun’s first overseas stop as she sought out neon artists around the world from whom she hoped to learn. While working with Dutch artist Remy de Feyter in the Netherlands, Chankalun asked how to achieve a flickering effect she had seen in another studio’s work, a question she had posed to Hong Kong’s masters with little success. De Feyter told her it required an oven. “That’s the moment when… I was like, ‘Oh my god’,” Chankalun said. “If you trace back to why we have the neon trade in Hong Kong, it was back in the 50s and 60s and… it was a trade for bread and butter,” she continued. “Hong Kong families wouldn’t have an oven because it’s Western.” That realisation – that Hong Kong’s post-war neon benders were working with different equipment and within a different socio-economic framework – inspired Chankalun to investigate “how different countries developed neon based on cultural, geographical, historical factors.” Her journey, a project she calls The Neon Girl, has taken her to France, Japan, Taiwan and the United States. “I have learned so much… I understand my identity more, also the history of Hong Kong’s neon industry, and how we compare to other cultures,” she said. Despite this, Chankalun has yet to be accepted by most of the city’s neon masters. “A lot of people in the industry thought I wasn’t bending my own neon,” she said. She proved otherwise when she created a large-scale neon sculpture in collaboration with Swiss skincare brand La Prairie called “Light as Air” for Art Basel in Hong Kong last year. Displayed in Tai Kwun, it was 10 metres long, five metres tall and three metres wide. “I believe it was the first outdoor neon art installation of this scale in Hong Kong,” Chankalun said, later adding that she had one champion in the local industry. “I feel like master Wong is really proud of what I did,” she said, referring to the craftsman who first showed her how to bend glass to make neon. For the others, Chankalun had a message. “I won’t be doing neon signs,” she said. “I’m just doing something experimental. I just want to break boundaries of what neon… is and I will keep doing that in my own way.” Chankalun’s episode was the final one of the first season of HKFP Yum Cha – which featured a diverse range of voices, from artists to scientists, who share their perspective on Hong Kong as it is today.

HKFP,469564,,https://hongkongfp.com/2024/01/27/hkfp-yum-cha-carol-liang-on-fighting-stigma-surrounding-mental-health-in-hong-kong/,2024-01-27T10:00:00,,"Mental health in Hong Kong was forced front of mind last June after two women were fatally stabbed in a shopping mall in an apparently random attack. Reports that the suspect had been diagnosed with a serious mental health condition were quick to emerge, sparking discussions rife with often alarmist inaccuracies. Carol Liang, deputy CEO of mental health charity Mind HK, was among those trying to fight the false assumptions. “When that happened… I immediately had to write a response; ‘not everyone with a mental health condition will be violent.’ That is the main message that I wanted to get across, that actually the majority of people with a mental health problem are not violent at all, they’re more likely to be the ones… on the other end of it,” Liang told HKFP’s podcast Yum Cha. Apple | Spotify | Overcast | Amazon Music | Pandora | YouTube | RSS Combating the stigma surrounding mental health is central to Liang’s role at Mind HK. She has been with the organisation since its genesis in 2017, and has noticed a change in awareness of mental health over the years. Events such as the double mall murder have, Liang said, “quite a big impact in the way that perceive mental health.” “In some sense it was positive in that it created an urgency to do something about this… [to implement] structural changes,” Liang said. The Covid-19 pandemic, too, “really brought mental health as a topic of concern,” she added, saying that because everybody was “experiencing the same problem,” they felt more comfortable discussing how they were feeling. “In a way, it helped normalise the conversation a bit,” Liang said. However, just because people were talking about mental health it did not mean they were becoming more accepting of it, according to studies conducted by Mind HK. “What we found from our recent research in June is that there’s been a huge interest in mental health… but the interesting part was that stigma didn’t really improve… it got worse,” Liang said. She cited what she called “concerning statistics,” saying that “58 per cent of people in our study said that they would stop being friends with someone if they had a mental health condition, and 38 per cent said that that they would not be willing to work with someone [with a mental health condition].” Such stigma also impacted Hongkongers’ relationship with their own well-being, Liang said. “Our research found that about 60, 62 per cent of people who have a diagnosable mental health condition don’t disclose it to anybody… not their husband, their wife, their friend, their partner, their colleague,” she said. “People really do experience this in isolation, and I think that a problem is that people are not accessing help because of the stigma and how strong it is here.” Those who do seek help are sometimes unsure who to turn to. Some see their family doctor, while others go straight to a psychiatrist. “That, generally, is something we’re looking to change… sometimes you do need to go see a psychiatrist, but not everyone,” Liang said. Access to mental health professionals was an issue, too, with public psychiatry services in such high demand that appointments last around five minutes and private mental health care often prohibitively expensive. Mind HK has sought to “provide a layer within the system” by training what it calls “well-being practitioners.” “Really, they’re there to provide support to individuals experiencing mild to moderate mental health conditions, mostly anxiety and depression, because they are the most common,” Liang said. Following the stabbings in June, the government consulted its mental health advisory board and put forward “enhanced measures” to improve mental health support in the city. Months later, when Chief Executive John Lee delivered the second Policy Address of his tenure, these suggestions were included in it. Time will tell whether that showed a shift in the official approach to managing mental health in the city, but Liang said it was “promising” that the issue had been acknowledged in October’s Policy Address, even if very little of it was new. From 2019 until 2022, mental health was not mentioned at all by the city’s leader in setting out the administrative vision for the year ahead. Among the suggestions mentioned by Lee was a mental health literacy resource kit for school students, which Liang said “makes a lot of sense.” “We’ve seen that one of the main areas of concern in Hong Kong is the mental health of not only the elderly, which is a very vulnerable group, but also the youth,” Liang said. “We have these suicide rates that are rising, young people had a really difficult time during Covid, they were probably the most impacted, so I think it’s right that there needs to be better mental health literacy within school… and not only kids but parents and teachers.” Friends, too, can play a role. “Studies always show, especially among youth, the first person a person goes to when they are experiencing symptoms, they don’t want it to be a professional, they want it to be a peer,” Liang said, adding that it was “really important to normalise [mental health] and have those conversations, because what can be detrimental to a person is when they suffer alone.” “We all have mental health… it’s a spectrum that we all go up and down on… throughout our lives… arguably, there is no such thing as physical or mental health – it’s just health.” The final episode of the first season of HKFP Yum Cha – which features a diverse range of voices, from artists to scientists, who share their perspective on Hong Kong as it is today – will be released next Saturday.

HKFP,468936,,https://hongkongfp.com/2024/01/20/hkfp-yum-cha-astrid-andersson-on-hong-kongs-critically-endangered-cockatoo-population/,2024-01-20T09:00:00,,"When Astrid Andersson tells people what she does for a living, she is often met with incredulity. “People don’t believe me when I say I’m a cockatoo researcher,” Andersson said on the latest episode of HKFP’s podcast Yum Cha. “But it’s true.” The postdoctoral researcher at the University of Hong Kong has dedicated her scientific career to investigating the white birds with a bright yellow crest and unforgettable squawk that can be seen – and heard – in many of the parks on Hong Kong Island as the sun rises and sets. Native to East Timor and a handful of Indonesian islands, with wild landscapes of rugged hills interrupted by thorny thickets of green, yellow-crested cockatoos do not really belong in Hong Kong. Apple | Spotify | Overcast | Amazon Music | Pandora | YouTube | RSS “It’s a really unusual situation,” Andersson told HKFP, sitting on a bench in the middle of Hong Kong Park, an 80,000-square-metre green enclave in the heart of the city. “We’re here in, like, the most urban and developed and cosmopolitan part of Hong Kong really – [it’s] Admiralty, we’ve got major banks, it’s the CBD, basically – and here is the hot spot, the real home base, for cockatoos in Hong Kong. It’s bizarre.” The International Union for Conservation of Nature puts the remaining global population of Cacatua sulphurea somewhere between 1,200 and 2,000, making the species critically endangered. About 200 of those live in Hong Kong, according to Andersson’s estimates. How they came to nest in the cotton trees on Hong Kong Island is the stuff of urban folklore. and something that Andersson tried to get to the bottom of during her PhD. “The most popular theory is that the governor of Hong Kong, during the Japanese invasion in World War Two, he had a bunch of these cockatoos as pets and when the Japanese were advancing, he released them, and… that was the founder population,” Andersson said. “But I do think that, even if that’s true, this population is most likely supplemented by continual escapees or released individuals, because when we do we do an annual cockatoo count… I always see a few individuals that I notice are of a slightly different subspecies or… a different species altogether, mixed in.” Regardless of how these birds became one of the city’s invasive species, how yellow-crested cockatoos arrived in Hong Kong is unambiguous: via the pet trade. “They actually are a very popular cage bird pet,” Andersson said. “Especially in the 1980s and early 1990s, yellow crested cockatoos… were very popular. There were over 70,000 of them exported from Indonesia at that time… and it’s around then that they started showing up in Hong Kong, as well, in large numbers.” That industry has been central to their decline. “In Indonesia, unfortunately, the major pressure has been trapping for the pet trade. So, during the 80s and 90s when it was still perfectly legal to do so, they were trapped rates that were just completely unsustainable, and then, actually, that has continued,” Andersson said. Internationally, trade in wild-caught yellow-crested cockatoos was banned in 2002, but the sale of captive-bred birds remains legal. And while rigorous protections are in place to protect the native population on Indonesia’s Komodo Island, the Asian Species Action Partnership has noted that “trapping for the pet trade continues with declines noted in almost all other populations.” Andersson recalled an incident in 2015, when a man was arrested after being found by Indonesian authorities with more than 20 birds stuffed into plastic bottles. “They were illegally trapped,” she said, adding that while “that’s the major threat they face” the birds were also contending with human-led habitat loss and the impacts of the climate crisis. Another issue, was identifying captive-bred birds from ones that had been illegally captured from the wild. There were methods in place, Andersson said, but during surveys of Hong Kong’s Yuen Po Street Bird Market conducted during her PhD, she found that they did not appear to be routinely applied. “You’re supposed to see that they have a band on their leg with an ID number,” she said. “But when I was doing the survey, I noticed a few birds didn’t have a band, or they had a band that… you could remove, or it didn’t have a number on. There didn’t seem to be a really consistent standard for these identification and traceability means,” she continued. “The issue arises when you can’t really tell, say, [whether] a cockatoo has been smuggled from Indonesia in a plastic bottle, and then put in the bird market.” After completing her PhD in 2021, Andersson turned her focus on the genetic makeup of Hong Kong’s cockatoos, “trying to figure out: are they inbred, are they hybrids or are they… pure subspecies of yellow-crested cockatoos? Are they from a certain island in Indonesia or another one… that sort of thing.” Her findings could be important not only to help understand the city’s population, but perhaps for the conservation of yellow-crested cockatoos in their native habitats. “If there was genetic rescue needed in Indonesia, and it was assessed to be safe, and all of the proper procedures that you have to do when you reintroduce birds were followed… it could turn out that Hong Kong has actually provided a reservoir, a genetic reservoir for this critically endangered species,” she said. Gesturing to the skyscrapers that surround Hong Kong Park, Andersson added: “I don’t know that the bankers working in these towers here in Hong Kong know that when they look out the window while they’re on their conference call and they see these birds flying past, it’s actually a really rare species.” New episodes of HKFP Yum Cha are published on Saturdays.

HKFP,467667,,https://hongkongfp.com/2024/01/13/hkfp-yum-cha-photographer-xyza-cruz-bacani-on-domestic-workers-hong-kong-and-championing-migrants/,2024-01-13T10:00:00,,"Photographer and artist Xyza Cruz Bacani knows what it is like to grow up without a mother present; hers was overseas working in the home of a Hong Kong family to provide a better life for Bacani and her siblings, who remained in the Philippines. Years later, Bacani joined her mother to work in that same Hong Kong household as a migrant domestic worker, a move that proved fateful for the young Filipina, as she discussed in the latest episode of the HKFP Yum Cha podcast. Now based in New York City, Bacani spoke to HKFP during her first trip back to Hong Kong in years after being kept away by a whirlwind work schedule and, later, Covid-related travel restrictions. She was in the city to promote an exhibition of her work, which was organised by NGO Pathfinders Hong Kong to coincide with the release of a report on the impact of migration on children. Apple | Spotify | Overcast | Amazon Music | Pandora | YouTube | RSS “We have to include children in conversations about migration because most mothers migrate because of their children… because they want to give an economic stability for their children,” Bacani said. “In an ideal world, no mother should be separated from their children, ever.” When Bacani arrived in Hong Kong in 2006, aged 19, she said she “sensed the [city’s] kinetic energy,” and was “fascinated” by it. “It was an adventure, you know. I didn’t know what was going to happen to me, but at that moment, I was like: ‘Oh my God, this city is beautiful’.” That first impression of Hong Kong played an integral role in shaping Bacani’s future. She soon began travelling across the city with a camera on her days off, shooting what would become her signature intimate black and white scenes. Her impetus at the time was sharing what she saw through the lens with her mother, who despite having lived in Hong Kong for years had seen very little of it. “My mom… chose to work on her holiday to send money to the Philippines, and she has not really experienced Hong Kong,” Bacani said. “So I thought, through my photographs, at least she can see it.” She continued: “It’s a very interesting city, the light is beautiful… like if you look at it, it’s different shades of grey, so when you do a black and white photo it really pops out… once you capture the energy in a frame, you can almost feel it jumping out to you.” Bacani posted her photographs to Facebook, and they were seen by a journalist in San Francisco, in the US, who sent them to The New York Times, which published them. Bacani described what happened next as “like a rollercoaster.” “I didn’t ask for it, but I think the universe pushed it,” she said, saying that she had been happy in Hong Kong, with her mum and Mrs Louis, their employer. Bigger things beckoned, though, and Bacani began working as a street and documentary photographer for major international media, including National Geographic and America’s National Public Radio. In 2017, she produced a book called We Are Like Air, celebrating migrant workers and their complex identities as women, mothers, individuals. Explaining the title, Bacani said: “Migrant workers for me are like air. They’re important, a necessity, but… they’re unseen, like air.” Her mother, and their family’s story, is integral to the book, which, Bacani said, positions “migrant workers as champions.” “[Migrant domestic workers] are the axis that carry both sides of migration; they’re actually carrying their families, and the families they serve,” she continued. “It’s always easy to celebrate people like me, who broke the ceiling. But often we forget that in everyday lives we have these women that are working, holding everything together holding everything together, they’re like glue… for me their champions. They’re not just victims. They’re champions.” New episodes of HKFP Yum Cha are published on Saturdays.

HKFP,467459,,https://hongkongfp.com/2024/01/06/hkfp-yum-cha-hong-kong-shifts-shines-spotlight-invisible-workers-who-keep-city-going/,2024-01-06T15:00:00,,"Behind Hong Kong’s clean streets and 24-hour convenience is a web of workers, many in low-paid positions, who toil tirelessly to keep the city going. Cynthia Cheng and Maxime Vanhollebeke have made it their mission to honour the people whose work too often goes unnoticed through social impact storytelling platform Hong Kong Shifts, which they discussed on the most recent episode of HKFP’s Yum Cha podcast. The project involves speaking to shift workers across the city and telling their stories on Hong Kong Shifts’ social media accounts through photography and bilingual write-ups in English and Chinese. “Storytelling is really at the core of everything we do at Hong Kong Shifts,” Cheng said. “Not only is it just sharing of human stories, but there’s an angle to our stories, which is to put a spotlight on people who are working behind the scenes all around us in the city,” she said. “We really hope to be able to use these stories to build empathy, to build bridges, and to foster connections between different communities in the city – which is why we call it social impact storytelling.” Apple | Spotify | Overcast | Amazon Music | Pandora | YouTube | RSS Many of those featured by Hong Kong Shifts work low-income jobs in a city where some 20 per cent of residents, or 1.36 million people, are living in poverty, according to Oxfam Hong Kong. A weaker than expected economic recovery since all Covid restrictions were lifted last year has also had a disproportionate impact on those in low-income households, with many still struggling with living costs despite being in work. Oxfam’s latest poverty report found that almost 60 per cent of those experiencing working poverty have full-time employment. Cheng and Vanhollebeke said that while earnings were rarely “an essential part” of their interviews, dignity and a desire for respect were. Highlighting street cleaners and Hong Kong’s “cardboard grannies,” elderly women who collect cardboard boxes to sell for a few dollars, Cheng said that during the height of Covid, “they said to us that… ‘this is our wage – it’s fine, it’s not, it’s not great – but what we kind of really do miss is… connecting with people in our community, or people acknowledging us, or giving us the recognition that we are working hard and we’re here to serve the community’.” Vanhollebeke said that giving people the recognition they deserved was “a consistent thing we hear from the people that we are interviewing.” “We all need recognition: from our friends; from work, whether it’s recognition from our clients, from our colleagues. [It’s] just a basic human need which is not fulfilled for many shift workers because we fail to realise that their customers are all of us,” Vanhollebeke said. “I still remember the street cleaner on Hollywood Road… [she said:] ‘Yes, I don’t make much. Yes, it’s challenging. Yes, I need more more sanitary protection. But what I need most is people to acknowledge me, or even eye contact.’ And that was really the moment I realised [Hong Kong Shifts] is worth doing.” The project has benefitted the pair in other ways, leading them to explore corners of Hong Kong that they might never have otherwise ventured to. “I mean, as a team working on the project, that’s one of the aspects we love. We just literally pick a neighbourhood we’ve never been [to] and we just walk around and we see what happens,” Vanhollebeke said. “And I would invite everyone to try it out. It’s a really fun way of discovering Hong Kong, and Hong Kong has so much to offer.” For Cheng, who was born in Canada but grew up in Hong Kong before relocating to the UK, it also allowed her to reconnect with the city and its people through language. “I did grow up in very much of a bubble, and so being able to use Cantonese – which is a language that I only started picking up again properly since I moved back here five years ago – using that to connect with people in our community, and to be able to engage with them, and to make them laugh… that for me is like really special,” she said. “It’s just made my experience a lot richer.” New episodes of HKFP Yum Cha are published on Saturdays.
