After Trump announced a 34-percent new tariff on imports of Chinese goods — taking the added rate imposed this year to 54 percent — Beijing said it would slap an equivalent across-the-board tariff on US goods, among other countermeasures. China used to target specific industries in a “mirror response” to US export restrictions, said Emily Benson of consulting firm Minerva Technology Policy Advisors. But its broader plan unveiled Friday marks a “pretty significant warning shot” to the Trump administration to hold off further measures, she told AFP. What is the state of US-China trade, and what US sectors stand to be impacted? The United States exported $144.6 billion in goods to China in 2024, much less than the $439.7 billion it imported, Commerce Department data shows. Among its exports, key sectors include electrical and electronic equipment and various fuels, alongside oilseed and grains. But China likely has more confidence to retaliate this time compared with Trump’s first presidency, when he engaged in a tit-for-tat tariff war with Beijing. “While the US is still obviously a very important market, fewer firms are now existentially dependent on US suppliers,” said Lynn Song, ING chief economist for Greater China. She added that Beijing has also made efforts towards technological self-sufficiency. “US farmers will bear a heavy burden,” said Asia Society Policy Institute vice president Wendy Cutler. Their agricultural exports to China could “become too expensive to be competitive” with Beijing’s added tariffs, she told AFP. Soybeans, oilseeds and certain grains were a key US export to China, amounting to $13.4 billion last year, US trade data showed. “China bought 52 percent of our (soybean) exports in 2024,” said American Soybean Association chief economist Scott Gerlt. Given the size of its purchases, China cannot easily be replaced, he told AFP. Soybean prices plunged on Friday’s news. China also imported $14.7 billion of various fuels and oils from the United States last year. Tariffs could impact the oil and gas industry in states like Texas, which alongside Louisiana saw such exports to China surge in 2023, said a US-China Business Council report. And the US exported some $15.3 billion in electrical machinery to China last year, official trade data showed. But semiconductor shipments have faltered on expanding US export controls on advanced tech. Besides tariffs, China has restricted exports of rare earth elements and taken action against US firms — including drone companies and those in the defense and aerospace sectors. “China controls about 69 percent of rare earth element mining. They also control about 90 percent of refining,” said Benson of Minerva Technology Policy Advisors. “That’s going to probably be a chokepoint moving forward,” she added. This could affect semiconductor manufacturing, magnets, optics and lasers. “Some of these are targeted, of course, at chips,” she said. With Washington and Beijing turning to a growing range of tools in their conflict, Benson warned that the US “is relatively exposed to these Chinese controls” without an industrial policy response providing “a major cash infusion to scale up domestic production.” Washington, United States Produced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic standards.

Two of the ports are located at the Panama Canal, a strategic waterway key to international trade that US President Donald Trump claims is controlled by China and which America should “take back.” Beijing then criticised CK Hutchison, claiming it had “betrayed” China. As the firm’s shares plummeted, the Chinese market regulator said that it would review the deal. Media reports then said that the conglomerate would not be going ahead with the transaction. The deal was expected to be signed on Wednesday, but the date came and went without any updates. Here’s what to know about the controversial ports deal, how China has reacted, and the geopolitical implications amid a deepening US-China trade war. CK Hutchison, partly owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, said on March 4 that it had entered into a US$22.8 billion deal to sell 45 ports to a consortium comprising US-based asset management firm BlackRock and global port operator Terminal Investment Limited, headquartered in Geneva. According to the latest company brochure, Hutchison Ports – a division of CK Hutchison – operates 53 ports across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Americas. In the announcement, CK Hutchison said the deal did not include the sale of its operations in mainland China and Hong Kong, where it has a total of 10 ports. See also: What are Hong Kong’s links to the Panama Canal, and does China really control the waterway as Trump claims? The company said that the transaction was “purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports.” Media reports have highlighted the sale of CK Hutchison’s two ports at the Panama Canal – the Balboa and Cristobal ports, on either side of the Central American country’s waterway. The Panama Canal ports are not among the world’s 15 busiest ports. Ports in mainland China dominate the top spots, while Hong Kong is ranked 11th. However, the 82-kilometre Panama Canal is a primary route for trade as it is the main connection between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Over 40 per cent of US container traffic is said to travel through the canal every year. The Panama Canal was constructed and operated in the early 1900s by the United States, which had – and still has – considerable influence in Panama. It was given to Panama in 1999 and has been under the control of the Panama government since. CK Hutchison’s deal announcement comes amid a deepening trade war between the US and China. The Panama Canal has been a major talking point in US President Donald Trump’s foreign policy rhetoric, mentioned in his inauguration speech in January. At the time, he said: “China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” Trump also refused to rule out a military invasion of Panama to regain control, prompting the Central American nation to lodge a complaint with the United Nations. The Panama government has denied Trump’s accusation that China exercises control of the waterway. But Chinese companies do have a presence there, and Beijing has also made investments in the canal and the country’s infrastructure. Panama was also the first Latin American country to join China’s Belt and Road Initiative, although it withdrew in February amid Trump’s assertions of China’s control of the nation. Beijing has criticised CK Hutchison’s deal, suggesting that the Hong Kong conglomerate was caving in to the US at the expense of China. China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said on Chinese social media platform Weibo on March 28 that it would review the deal to “protect fair market competition and public interest.” Days later, on Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said: “Let me stress again that China firmly opposes using economic coercion and bullying to harm other countries’ legitimate rights and interests.” It was the Chinese state-backed newspaper Ta Kung Pao that fired the opening salvo of the attacks. Since CK Hutchison’s sale announcement, the Hong Kong-based paper has published at least seven scathing commentaries about the deal. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the Hong Kong Liaison Office, both top Chinese bodies in the city, reposted some of the op-eds – including one on March 13, which called the sale an act of “spineless grovelling” that neglected national interests and “betrayed and sold out all Chinese people.” One of Ta Kung Pao’s latest opinion pieces, published on Tuesday, said CK Hutchison should have “the most basic sense of morality and righteousness to defend [China’s] interests.” Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee also chimed in. He told reporters in mid-March: “We oppose the abusive use of coercion, of bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations.” He added that “any transaction must comply with legal and regulatory requirements.” Last Friday, the same day China announced a probe into the deal, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters that she was aware of China’s comments. “It’s also no surprise that the CCP is upset at this acquisition, which will reduce their control over the Panama Canal area,” Bruce said. “We are also glad to see US investors acquire a controlling stake in the Panama Ports Company, which owns and operates the ports at Balboa and Cristóbal at either end of the Panama Canal.” Provides context or background, definition and detail on a specific topic.

On a sunny Wednesday at a scenic park in Pingtan — just 130 kilometres (80 miles) from Taiwan — a steady stream of tourists wearing sunglasses and brandishing mobile phones hiked to the edge of a cliff for views of the self-ruled island. Ye Shenjian, snapping a photo of his wife and young son, told AFP he had seen news of the drills on TV and was hopeful that one day Taiwan would “return to China”. “I hope that one day we can ride the train directly to Taiwan,” he said. Another, Gao Feng, toured the park with his wife, using a looking glass to peer at nearby rock formations and the water. “I’d always heard of this beautiful place. I’ve wanted to come and see a bluer sea, which is pretty rare in China,” the 55-year-old doctor from eastern Anhui province said. “It’s pretty close to Taiwan. Makes me a bit sentimental.” For Gao and others in his generation, the idea of Taiwan under Chinese control has been much-discussed since his youth. “The liberation of Taiwan was something written in our primary school textbooks,” he said. “I’ve always believed we are one family, and a family should be together sooner or later.” Visiting with her friend from southwestern Yunnan, Wang Juedan also said she had Taiwan on her mind since her youth — the island produced some of her favourite television shows. “Seeing it feels pretty shocking,” she said. “We’ve only seen Taiwan on television in dramas or the news.” The 28-year-old said she hopes unification would come soon: “Travelling there will be more convenient.” Communist China has never ruled Taiwan, where indigenous tribes have lived for thousands of years. The island was partly or totally ruled at various times by the Dutch, Spanish, China’s Qing dynasty and Japan. While Beijing has threatened to use force to bring Taiwan under its control, and its annexation by China would likely see the eradication of the island’s vibrant democratic system and a crackdown on any opposition to Chinese rule. That did not phase retiree Wang Quanqiu, who said he had driven almost 2,000 kilometres from Beijing to Pingtan with his wife. He said he dreams of going back to Taiwan one day, which he visited twice before Taipei restricted Chinese residents from travelling there. “Once our precious island Taiwan returns, I want to drive my own car all the way to Taiwan,” the 71-year-old said. He and his wife stay up to date with the news about Taiwan as avid watchers of a regular state media programme on cross-strait activities, Wang said. “It won’t take that long for my dream to come true,” Wang said. AFP journalists saw a jet flying from the sea over the scenic area, which lies next to a Chinese military base — a stark reminder of the military drills taking place in the waters around Taiwan. Resident Liu Lili, visiting her son who studied nearby, also told AFP she was “looking forward to the day when China could get them back.” Liu, in her 50s, expressed disdain for some Taiwanese politicians — in particular former President Tsai Ing-wen. They were “eating China’s food”, she said. Pingtan locals were a little more circumspect. One resident, wearing a bright orange vest and tall rubber boots as she gathered waste from the ocean, said she did not expect Chinese leadership to use force. The woman, who did not want to share her name, said she and other locals kept their distance from anything related to China’s military — gesturing towards a set of an army compound atop a nearby mountain. “Locals definitely want peace.” Pingtan, China Produced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic standards.

The hugely popular video-sharing app, which has over 170 million American users, is under threat from a US law that passed overwhelmingly last year and orders TikTok to split from its Chinese owner ByteDance or face a ban in the United States. Motivated by national security fears and widespread belief in Washington that TikTok is ultimately controlled by the Chinese government, the law took effect on January 19, one day before Trump’s inauguration. But the Republican president quickly announced a delay that has allowed it to continue to operate; that delay is set to expire on April 5. Trump has downplayed risks that TikTok is in danger of being banned in the United States, saying he remains confident of finding a buyer for the app’s US business. The US president also suggested TikTok could even be part of a broader deal with China to ease the stinging tariffs he imposed on Beijing as part of a worldwide blitz of levies. Asked Thursday if he was willing to make deals with countries on tariffs, he said: “As long as they are giving us something that is good. For instance with TikTok.” He added: “We have a situation with TikTok where China will probably say we’ll approve a deal but will you do something on the tariffs. The tariffs give us great power to negotiate.” According to reports, the most likely solution would see existing US investors in ByteDance roll over their stakes into a new independent global TikTok company. Additional US investors, including Oracle and Blackstone, the private equity firm, would be brought on to reduce the proportion of Chinese investors. Much of TikTok’s US activity is already housed on Oracle servers, and the company’s chairman, Larry Ellison, is a longtime Trump ally. But uncertainty remains, particularly over what would happen to TikTok’s valuable algorithm. The New York Times suggested the new company could licence it from ByteDance. Amazon has also reportedly made a last-minute bid to buy TikTok. Produced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic standards.

He [&#8230;]","Fri, 04 Apr 2025 01:00:00 +0000",Hans Tse,2025-04-04 01:00:00,"A wildfire that broke out on Lantau Island’s Mui Wo nearly two weeks ago burned down hundreds of trees, many of them planted by horticulturist Paul Melsom over the past two decades. “It’s painful to walk amongst all the ashes. Trees you’ve been nurturing for a long time just reduced to nothing,” Melsom told HKFP. He had started planting trees in 2002 as part of a reforestation project in Mui Wo, on the eastern part of outlying Lantau Island. The blaze on March 23 destroyed many trees aged 15 to 20 years old in an area that was planted with rich vegetation, he said. Jenny Quinton – also a dedicated tree planter and the founder of Ark Eden, a green education non-profit in Mui Wo – told HKFP that she feared another wildfire could occur during Ching Ming Festival, also known as Tomb-Sweeping Day, on Friday. It is the day when people visit their ancestors’ graves, usually in the countryside, bringing food offerings and burning incense, candles, joss paper, and other paper goods. The fire on March 23 occurred near a cemetery. “Ching Ming is the most dangerous time because it goes on [for] a long time,” Quinton said, adding that people tend to visit family graves in different parts of Hong Kong for approximately six weeks before and after the day of the ancestral festival. Among the over 30 hill fires reported on Tomb-Sweeping Day last year was a blaze on an islet off Lamma Island, which trapped 27 people, according to local media reports. They were eventually rescued by firefighters. Incidents often occur when a fire danger warning is in force, meaning the weather poses a high risk of fire. But people also play a major role in wildfires, Melsom said. “All fires in Hong Kong are made by humans. No fires are made by nature… by thunder or lightning,” he said. “The majority of people are very good, but it takes just that one person to destroy a large area,” Melsom added. The Mui Wo fire raged through the hillside for at least a couple of hours. The Fire Services Department (FSD) said it received a report of a fire in Mui Wo, at 1.24pm on March 23, and firefighters arrived on the scene at 2pm. A helicopter from the Government Flying Service arrived at 2.24pm and dumped water. The fire was put out at 3.17pm, according to the FSD. At the time, the red fire danger warning was in force, indicating that the risk of a hill fire was extreme. The FSD told HKFP that the fire torched an estimated 300 square metres of land. HKFP visited the site on Monday, eight days after the fire. From afar, a large part of a slope looked brown and charred. Up close, it was barren and covered in ash. Melsom said it was fortunate that the fire was contained on one slope of a mountain, thanks to the efforts of the firefighters and the Government Flying Service. But it still caused more losses than any previous fires in the area, he said, partly because the blaze happened in a large “closed canopy forest,” where tree crowns touched one another and a fire could easily spread. He added that the area was home to 85 species of trees, all native to Hong Kong. “It’s difficult to determine [the losses],” Melsom said, adding that most trees in the affected area would die. While some trees may survive and grow back, they are still severely damaged, he added. “It’s one of my worst losses.” It was unclear what started the fire last month in Mui Wo. However, authorities say that most hill fires in Hong Kong’s countryside are caused by “human negligence.” The Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department (AFCD), which oversees Hong Kong’s country parks, regularly issues statements urging residents who go tomb sweeping to prevent causing a fire accidentally, advising them to burn paper offerings inside a container. It is an offence to burn offerings without taking steps to prevent wildfires in the countryside in Hong Kong. The maximum penalty is a fine of HK$25,000 and one year behind bars. Separately, people using fire outside designated places in country parks could also be fined up to HK$5,000 and jailed for one year. In an emailed reply on Thursday, the AFCD told HKFP that there were 81 prosecutions relating to two offences between 2022 and 2024, among which 79 led to convictions. Five more cases remain under investigation. Quinton called for a stronger presence of police and AFCD officers during the festival, saying it could deter people from using fire recklessly when performing ancestral rites at family graves. The presence of officers “sends a reminder” to people, who will behave more carefully when supervised, Melsom said. The AFCD said authorities will step up patrols in country parks and remind grave sweepers to avoid causing wildfire. Officers will take immediate legal action if an offence is suspected. But the public needs to be constantly reminded about the hazards of a wildfire, Quinton said, as prosecutions are often hampered by difficulties in collecting evidence. She noticed that wildfire awareness had slipped in recent years and hoped people would pay more attention to the issue. While “you respect traditions… you have to still behave carefully,” she said. She pointed to the Pat Sin Leng blaze in 1996, one of the deadliest wildfires in Hong Kong’s history, which killed five and injured 13, many of them student hikers. Authorities believe that the fire was caused by students smoking. “We don’t want something like that again, because you could die being caught in a fire of big trees,” Quinton said.

Beijing has vowed countermeasures in response and warned the new tariffs will cripple global supply chains — and Washington’s own interests. AFP looks at how so-called “liberation day” tariffs — which bring levies on Chinese goods to 54 percent — will hit China: China’s export-driven economy is particularly sensitive to vicissitudes in international trade. Trade between it and the United States, the world’s two largest economies, is vast. See also: Hong Kong businesses forced to weigh options as Trump’s tariffs squeeze access to US market According to Beijing’s customs data, sales of Chinese goods to the United States last year totalled more than $500 billion — 16.4 percent of the country’s exports. US duties also threaten to harm China’s fragile economic recovery as it struggles with a long-running debt crisis in the property sector and persistently low consumption — a downturn Beijing had sought to slow with broad fiscal stimulus last year. But an intensified trade war will likely mean China cannot peg its hopes for strong economic growth this year on its exports, which reached record highs in 2024. “The US tariffs on Chinese imports announced so far this year could fully negate the lift from the fiscal stimulus measures announced so far,” Frederic Neumann, Chief Asia Economist at HSBC, told AFP. And while he said the impact on export competition may be slightly mitigated by the fact that all countries are hit by the levies, he stressed “the drag on Chinese growth is nevertheless significant”. The new tariffs slap 10 percent levies on imports from around the world. But China — whose yawning trade deficit with the United States of $270.4 billion has long drawn Trump’s ire — faces much higher levies. The latest salvo adds 34 percent to a 20 percent rate imposed last month, bringing the total additional tariffs on imports from the Asian economic powerhouse imposed by the Trump administration to 54 percent. The tariffs come into effect in stages — a ten percentage point bump on Thursday, followed by the full levy on April 9. China is also under sector-specific tariffs on steel, aluminium and car imports. Analysts expect the new levies to take a significant chunk out of the country’s GDP, which Beijing’s leadership hope will grow five percent this year. Julian Evans-Pritchard, Head of China Economics at Capital Economics, said in a note he said he expected the economic hit to range from 0.5 percent to one percent of GDP. Likely to be hit hardest are China’s top exports to the United States — the country is the dominant supplier of goods from electronics and electrical machinery to textiles and clothing, according to the Peterson Institute of International Economics. But analysts also warn that because of the crucial role Chinese goods play in supplying US firms, the tariffs may also have major knock-on effects. “US imports from China are dominated by capital goods and industrial materials instead of consumer goods,” Gene Ma, Head of China Research at the Institute of International Finance, told AFP. “The tariff will hurt US manufacturers as well as consumers.” “This trade war not only has a destructive impact on China but also on the global trade system,” Chen Wenling, Chief Economist at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges in Beijing, said. Beijing has yet to specify what exactly its “countermeasures” will involve. But the retaliation could see Beijing hike pre-existing tariffs imposed in response to previous measures. “China’s countermeasures should be reasonable, beneficial and measured,” Mei Xinyu, an economist at the state-affiliated Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing, told AFP. “They need to be strong and precise, while also avoiding turning the countermeasures into a decoupling of China and the United States,” Mei added. China last month slapped tariffs of 15 percent in imports of coal and liquefied natural gas from the United States. Crude oil, agricultural machinery, big-engined vehicles and pickup trucks also face 10 percent duties. Analysts say those moves are designed to hit Trump’s support base — those in America’s rural heartlands that voted him into office last year. Beijing has called for dialogue to resolve the dispute, but any deal will take time. “There are still chances for the two parties to resume talks in the following months,” Betty Wang at Oxford Economics told AFP. “But historical experience suggests that tariffs are typically quick to rise and slow to fall.” Beijing, China Produced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic standards.

The Department of Health announced on Thursday that the city saw a decline in the number of new HIV infections for the ninth consecutive year. In 2024, health authorities received reports of new HIV cases from 297 males and 68 females aged between 14 and 89. A total of 312 people reported they were infected through sexual contact, with 216 cases involving homosexual or bisexual contact and the remaining 96 cases through heterosexual contact. The newly recorded cases last year put the city’s HIV infection toll since 1984 at 12,403, said Bonnie Wong, consultant for the Special Preventive Programme at the Centre for Health Protection’s Public Health Services Branch. “The prevalence of HIV infection among the general public in Hong Kong remained at 0.1 per cent, well below the global average, demonstrating the effectiveness of AIDS control and prevention in Hong Kong,” Wong said. On Thursday, the Department of Health said it recorded 74 new AIDS cases involving 63 males and 11 females. The figure put the cumulative total of confirmed AIDS cases in the city since 1985 at 2,557. The proportion of late diagnoses among the new HIV infections stood at around 40 to 50 per cent, the health department said. It warned that late diagnoses could lead to a greater risk of “opportunistic infections” and malignancies, which could result in a higher mortality rate. Individuals with late diagnoses may also contribute to an increased risk of HIV transmission in the community due to their “unsuppressed viral load,” the department said. A recent public health surveillance survey conducted by the Department of Health found that 55 per cent of female sex workers in Hong Kong had their last HIV test in the preceding year. The figure marked an increase from 37 per cent reported in a similar survey conducted in 2022. Ninety-nine per cent of the female sex workers surveyed said that they used condoms when having sex with non-regular clients. But the use of condoms with regular customers was “less consistent” among some respondents. The findings showed a need to step up efforts on promoting condom use, Wong said.

US President Donald Trump has ignited a potentially ruinous global trade war after imposing 10 percent levies on imports from around the world and harsh extra duties on key trading partners. Trump unveiled particularly stinging tariffs of 34 percent on China, one of its largest trading partners. The commerce ministry in Beijing said in a statement that those tariffs “do not comply with international trade rules and seriously harm the legitimate rights and interests of the relevant parties”. It urged Washington to “immediately cancel” them, warning they “endanger global economic development”, hurting US interests and international supply chains. It also accused the United States of a “typical unilateral bullying practice”. The tariffs come on top of a 20 percent rate imposed last month. At a weekly briefing Thursday, the commerce ministry slammed Washington’s “protectionism and bullying”. But it also said that the two sides were “maintaining communication” over sources of contention in trade and economic issues. Beijing’s foreign ministry also warned the United States that protectionism has no “exit ramp” and noted the broad international opposition to the measures. China previously responded to US tariffs with levies of up to 15 percent on a range of US agricultural goods including soybeans, pork and chicken. Chen Wenling, chief economist at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges in Beijing, told AFP that Beijing could potentially impose export controls of critical and rare minerals to the United States in response. “The United States has become a high-tariff nation, and its status as the flagbearer of free trade has diminished,” Chen said. US duties have threatened to harm China’s fragile economic recovery as it struggles with a long-running debt crisis in the property sector and persistently low consumption. An intensified trade war will likely mean China cannot peg its hopes for strong economic growth this year on its exports, which reached record highs in 2024. Trump labelled Wednesday’s measures “reciprocal” but many experts say his administration’s estimates for levies placed on US imports by other countries are wildly exaggerated. “The US claims to have suffered losses in international trade, using so-called ‘reciprocity’ as an excuse to raise tariffs on all trade partners,” Beijing said. “This approach disregards the balance of interests achieved through years of multilateral trade negotiations and ignores the fact that the US has long profited significantly from international trade,” it added. It instead called for “dialogue” to resolve the dispute. “There is no winner in a trade war, and there is no way out for protectionism,” it said, adding that “history has proven that raising tariffs does not solve the US’s own problems”. The US has also imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel and aluminium imports. China is the world’s leading steel manufacturer, though not a major exporter of the product to the United States.

Family members and contractors with security clearance are included in the ban. “Non-fraternisation” policies were common during the Cold War, with a limited version – affecting relationships with Chinese guards and support staff – put into place last summer in China. The policy was broadened days ahead of US President Donald Trump’s inauguration. The policy affects the US embassy in Beijing and its consulates in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenyang, according to the AP. It was not publicly announced, though it was communicated to personnel across China in January. Those with pre-existing relationships with Chinese citizens may reportedly apply for exemptions, though – if denied – they must leave their position or end the relationship.

Chen, 48, appeared at the District Court on Thursday morning. She was found guilty last month of rioting during a protest in 2019, after the judge sided with the prosecution and said she “stood on the same side as the protesters.” The social worker’s conviction came more than five years after the protest on August 31, 2019. Chen was initially cleared of rioting midway through her trial in September 2020, but the government successfully appealed the acquittal. Representing Chen, barrister Hector Pun pleaded to the court for a lighter sentence for his client. He said during mitigation that Chen was a person of good character who, besides helping people during her day job as a social worker, also did volunteering work in her free time. See also: Hong Kong social worker Jackie Chen did not obstruct police actions during 2019 protest, defence argues in retrial She had volunteered not just in Hong Kong, but also in Qinghai and Sichuan in mainland China, as well as in Nepal and Southeast Asia, Pun said. If not for her court case, Chen would probably be in Myanmar or Thailand now, the barrister added, a reference to the recent earthquake in Myanmar that killed over 3,000 and also caused damage in neighbouring Thailand. Rioting is punishable by up to 10 years in jail, but Chen faces up to a seven-year term, the maximum sentence that can be handed down at the District Court. Deputy District Judge May Chung adjourned the case to April 9 for sentencing. Chen, who did not testify in the trial or call witnesses, pleaded not guilty last December to rioting during the 2019 demonstration. That day, protesters set up roadblocks in Wan Chai and Admiralty, clashing with police officers who deployed tear gas and water cannon to disperse them. The social worker, who was arrested near the intersection of Hennessy Road and Marsh Road at around 8.20pm on suspicion of taking part in an illegal assembly, was speaking through a loudspeaker to police and asking them to act with restraint. The judge, however, said in her verdict that Chen’s words incorrectly implied that the police’s operations were “overly quick or violent.” On Thursday, Pun said Chen did not take on a leadership role in the protests, often standing at the back. There was also no evidence that she encouraged others to engage in violent or radical behaviour. Chen’s overall participation in the riot was low, Pun said, adding that she played a “passive” role. According to Pun, Chen also did not “give up on herself” or on others after her arrest. She studied a psychology masters in special education needs and graduated in 2021, her barrister said. Still, the long judicial process took a toll on her and Chen fell ill. She takes medication to control the illness, he said, without elaborating on what she was diagnosed with. When Chen faces sentencing next week, three other defendants in the same rioting case – Lai Pui-ki, Chung Ka-nang, and Jason Gung – will also see their jail terms delivered. The three were also cleared of rioting, but the government appealed their acquittals. They changed their pleas to guilty last September, and have been remanded since. Protests erupted in June 2019 over a since-axed extradition bill. They escalated into sometimes violent displays of dissent against police behaviour, amid calls for democracy and anger over Beijing’s encroachment. Demonstrators demanded an independent probe into police conduct, amnesty for those arrested and a halt to the characterisation of protests as “riots.” Support HKFP  |  Policies & Ethics  |  Error/typo?  |  Contact Us  |  Newsletter  | Transparency & Annual Report | Apps Help safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team HKFP has an impartial stance, transparent funding, and balanced coverage guided by an Ethics Code and Corrections Policy.

The government is set to submit a bill that will strengthen its crackdown on e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products as early as the end of this month, local media reported on Wednesday citing sources. The ban on the possession of e-cigarettes would have two phases, starting in public from 2026 before extending to private places later, according to the reports. The extension would be implemented after the first phase-ban is evaluated, though there is no timetable yet. The bill would include “10 measures to curb smoking” that will also see the sale of alternative smoking items prohibited, such as non-menthol flavoured cigarettes and fruit-flavoured shisha, over the next two years, the reports said. Last year, Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau vowed that Hong Kong “will fully ban all alternative smoking products,” saying there was consensus in society towards lowering the smoking prevalence rate and mitigate the impact of e-cigarettes on the health of young people. The government said it hoped to reduce the smoking prevalence rate to 7.8 percent this year, compared to 9.1 percent in 2023. Some smoking curbs could be enacted this year, such as those targeting the smuggling, buying and selling of illicit cigarettes. The maximum penalty for possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes could be increased from HK$1 million and two years in jail to HK$2 million and seven years behind bars.

No-smoking areas would also extend to cover three metres outside designated places such as the entrances of hospitals and schools. Smoking while queueing in outdoor public areas and sharing cigarettes with minors would also be banned. Hong Kong banned the import, manufacture, and sale of e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products in 2022.

District Court Judge Eddie Yip convicted Wong Chi-wing of one count each of rioting and wounding with intent on Thursday after an appeal court in August sent back the case to Yip’s court. Yip previously acquitted Wong in 2021. On Thursday, however, the judge determined that Wong had participated in the mob attack on July 21, 2019, during which over a hundred white-clad, rod-wielding men stormed Yuen Long MTR station, leaving 45 people injured, including journalists, protesters, commuters, and pro-democracy lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting. The mob attack marked a watershed during the months-long anti-extradition bill protests and unrest in 2019 and prompted widespread criticism of police inaction and misconduct after some officers were seen leaving the scene or interacting with the white-clad men. Wong was among eight people facing rioting and wounding charges over the July 2019 attacks. He was the only one found not guilty, while the other seven were convicted. In August, the Court of Appeal ruled that the trial judge, Yip, had overlooked evidence presented in the case and, therefore, erred in determining that Wong was not among the attackers. The appeal judges then overturned Wong’s non-guilty verdict and sent his case back to be reconsidered by Yip. See also: Ex-lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting files bid to appeal against rioting conviction and jail term linked to 2019 Yuen Long attack Re-examining the evidence on Thursday, Yip decided that a pair of brown trousers and blue sneakers found at Wong’s residence, as well as his unmasked appearance, matched the appearance of a man photographed on the scene, according to local media. To date, 21 people have been convicted of rioting over the Yuen Long attack – 13 of them belonged to the “white-clad” group, including Wong. The rest were other people at the scene. Seven of them were found guilty in December and sentenced last month, including ex-lawmaker Lam. All seven men have lodged appeals against their convictions and prison terms. An eighth man, who was tried separately, was convicted of rioting last April and sentenced to two years and nine months in jail.

Organisers would not confirm the removal but have denied the work is political, calling the Australian-based artist’s move “disrespectful.” Four-second black-and-white clips featuring Badiucao had been intermittently displayed on two LED billboards in Kowloon for Art Week. In the videos, the artist is seen silently mouthing a quote from Chairman Mao Zedong: “You must take part in revolution.” It is a quote from an essay featured in the Chinese Communist Party leader’s 1937 philosophical work On Practice. It is also the title of Badiucao’s graphic novel. The Mong Kok billboards were part of Art Innovation Gallery’s “Luminance” outdoor exhibition, which was launched last Friday, bringing together artists, designers, and brands. On Wednesday, Badicauo said in an X post that he understood the clip had been removed, representing the completion of his work. “The whole campaign captures the moment of repression [of] free expression in Hong Kong, whether it is coming from the authorities or inner fear within society,” he wrote. “But it also demonstrates the possibility of using creativity to infiltrate authoritarian systems.” Badiucao, who had used the pseudonym “Andy Chou” for the billboard project, said on Monday that he wanted to test the law whilst the flagship Art Basel fair was taking place. “There is no true creativity without freedom. Anything less is subpar, consumerist, and for the purchase of vapid billionaires and oligarchs. It is thus an indictment of Art Basel when it continues to stage its event in Hong Kong at a time when freedom of expression is under assault in the territory,” he said on Monday. Italy-based Art Innovation told HKFP on Wednesday that the artist gave “false information in order to be admitted to the exhibition,” describing the stunt as “really low.” In an emailed response, they said that they “are not political campaigners and we respect all forms and governmental rules, we have no interest in disseminating political views… it was the artist himself who added political descriptions and messages on his social media that are NOT in the exhibition, he only posted them later on social media.” They did not respond as to whether they knew of the artist’s true identity from the beginning, nor would they say if the artwork had been removed. They accused Badiucao of seeking media acclaim or trying to perform an act of dissent. “We are very embittered by this behaviour of the artist (more than political messages) who provided false information, making fun of the seriousness of professionals who have been working on the project for months and months with sacrifice and sweat and we believe it is really disrespectful to all the other artists who have respected the rules and the contract.” Calling Baiducao “a small person who defrauds the people he works with,” they included the artists’ original statement, which said the clip “explores the essence of presence – how we experience time, sensation, and awareness in fleeting moments.” Badiucao, born in Shanghai, China, is an award-winning political cartoonist, artist, and rights activist who has held exhibitions in the US, Europe, and Australia. He remained anonymous for years, but showed his face publicly in 2019, saying that the Chinese authorities had already identified him. The “Luminance” outdoor exhibition involved video art shown on LED screens on Sai Yeung Choi Street South and Argyle Street in Kowloon’s busy shopping thoroughfare of Mong Kok. It was originally set to end on Friday. “By combining art, technology, and urban visibility, Art Innovation redefines the traditional exhibition concept, transforming LED billboards into true digital canvases,” their press release last Friday said. Other artists featured on the Mong Kok LED boards this year included JungGyu Park, Sinisa K., Philip Giannattasio, Billy Ryan, Mat Voyce, Pacôme Pertant, Marcel van Luit, Elastique., Medina Kasimova & .ART Registry, Bonsai Mirai, Alan Bee, Josh Jen and Ariadna Canaan studio. During Art Week in 2023, the same gallery showcased a digital artist on a SOGO mall video billboard in Causeway Bay. However, artist Patrick Amadon was found to have hidden the names, ages, and jail terms of convicted Hong Kong protesters in the clip. It was removed shortly after he went public.

The rule has faced heavy scrutiny as US officials pointed to the growth of Chinese-founded online retailers Shein and Temu as a factor behind a surge of shipments using the exemption. The “de minimis” exemption allows goods valued at US$800 or below to enter the United States without paying duties or certain taxes. It has faced scrutiny due to a surge in parcels in recent years, with the White House saying that US Customs processes over 4 million exempted shipments into the US every day. In a fact sheet, the White House said that products imported under the exception from China would now be subject to a duty rate of either 30 percent of their value or US$25 per item, increasing to US$50 per item after June 1. Losing the exemption also means e-commerce firms potentially face more frequent inspections and must meet regulations on food safety and national security. According to analysts, some items currently imported through platforms like Temu or Shein might no longer be allowed into the US due to the extra burdens. Boasting an enormous selection of ultra-cheap items at a time when inflation has shrunk household spending power almost everywhere, Shein and Temu have become global phenomenons. The companies send out tens of billions of dollars worth of clothes, gadgets and other items from their vast network of factories in China annually. Official US figures show that exemption shipments rose to over 1.4 billion packages in fiscal year 2024, 60 percent of them from China. Other retailers such as Amazon might also be impacted by the “de minimis” removal. In February, Trump already scrapped the customs exemption but reversed his decision after the move caused major logistical disruptions. Beijing at the time responded with fury to the move, accusing the US of “politicizing trade and economic issues and using them as tools.” Washington, United States Produced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic standards.

Speaking during a Legislative Council (LegCo) meeting on Wednesday, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said the government-funded Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) and the Information Services Department (ISD), which publishes news for the authorities, were two departments with “no overlapping” functions. “Although RTHK and the ISD are both government departments and both carry the responsibility of disseminating government information, RTHK, as the public service broadcaster, and the ISD, being responsible for the government’s public relations, perform different duties,” he said in Cantonese. He added that merging them “may confuse the public… which may be counterproductive to the government’s overall public relations work.” His remarks were a response to lawmaker Junius Ho, who asked about ways to enhance “compatibility” of the two departments and even a possible merger as the city recorded large fiscal deficits for three consecutive years. Yau said that RTHK and the ISD were home to 762 and 451 job posts respectively in the current fiscal year, and that the staff in each department required different skills and experience. RTHK has to “cater for the needs of the mass audience,” including minority groups in Hong Kong, with programmes ranging from public affairs and national education to sports and lifestyle, he said. Meanwhile, the ISD is responsible for the government’s publicity and news dissemination, he said. The two departments have “distinctly different” missions, services, and operations, the commerce chief added. But lawmaker Regina Ip – also the convenor of the Executive Council, Hong Kong’s top advisory body – appeared unconvinced, saying that the two entities lacked “fundamental reform.” She also claimed RTHK was full of “redundant staff,” citing her experience being interviewed by the broadcaster, which she said brought more crew members to the interview than other media outlets. “While other broadcasters have one person on the mic and another in charge of the lighting, RTHK may easily show up with four people or even eight,” Ip said in Cantonese. “Sometimes [RTHK] does not air an interview long after it has been recorded. Those interviews risk being outdated,” she added. In response, Yau said that RTHK had already explored cost-cutting measures, such as using artificial intelligence in programming, and that the broadcaster would continue to do so. He added that authorities would “seriously consider” the lawmakers’ comments. During the same LegCo meeting, Clarence Leung, undersecretary of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, which oversees the ISD, also said that the department had been keen to adopt the latest technologies in promoting the government’s work. HKFP reported last year that RTHK began using AI-generated voices in place of some human presenters. An RTHK spokesperson told HKFP at that time that the technologies could help “relieve the staff shortage pressures.” The public broadcaster was caught in the crosshairs of pro-Beijing supporters, who accused it of being sympathetic to the city’s pro-democracy protesters during the protests and unrest in 2019. Since then, RTHK underwent a major restructuring that included scrapping its long-standing satirical show Headliner and adopting new editorial guidelines.

The government announced on Wednesday the launch of a one-month consultation on a regulatory regime for basketball betting under the Betting Duty Ordinance. A 16-page consultation document was released for the public to give feedback until May 2. The government proposed amending the ordinance to grant the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs the power to issue a basketball betting license to the Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC). The regulatory regime will mirror the existing one for football betting, the government said. According to the proposal, the licensing period will be fixed, and the government has the power to limit the number of bet types and classes of competitions. The licensed betting operator shall not accept bets from underage individuals or credit bets. Basketball matches involving Hong Kong teams or those that take place in the city are barred from bets to “promote a betting-free and healthy environment for the sport in Hong Kong,” the government said. The licensed operator should also display notices reminding the public of the seriousness of gambling addiction and provide information about services for gambling disorders, the government said. “As a matter of policy, the government does not encourage gambling,” a spokesperson for the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau said. “There is, however, undeniably an actual and persistent demand for gambling in Hong Kong which, if left unregulated, would likely give rise to illegal gambling activities and associated social problems and other criminal activities,” the spokesperson added. Financial Secretary Paul Chan unveiled the government’s intention to regulate basketball betting during his 2025 Budget speech in February. He said the legalisation could tackle illegal gambling and raise tax revenue, given the city’s estimated deficit of HK$87.2 billion. The finance chief projected that regulating basketball betting could generate HK$1.5 billion to HK$2 billion in tax revenue. According to estimates from the HKJC, the turnover for illegal basketball betting reached between HK$70 billion and HK$90 billion last year. In Wednesday’s consultation paper, the HKJC said that illegal betting in Hong Kong “has grown at an alarming rate.” The licensed operator for football betting and horse racing estimated that around 100,000 to 150,000 Hongkongers had bet illegally on basketball in 2023, and said that the number tripled last year to 430,000. Police efforts to combat illegal gambling are “significantly complicated” by the rapid digitalisation of illegal betting and technological advancements, the government said. The use of cryptocurrencies, stored-value tools, and micro-transactions has made illegal betting activities more covert, it said. “Against such [a] backdrop, a timely policy intervention to regulate basketball betting is considered necessary,” the consultation document read. In February, the Hong Kong Committee on Children’s Rights criticised the government’s plan to regulate basketball betting, saying that giving a green light for basketball betting was a “disastrous move.” The group went on to say that popularising sports betting could “lure” young people to bet with their limited financial resources that were otherwise budgeted for other needs. Gambling loss may also result in psychological pressure and guilt, which may deter individuals from seeking help, it said, warning that gamblers could enter a “vicious cycle” where they turn to lending agencies or engage in criminal activities.

The surprise manoeuvres were criticised by Washington as “intimidation tactics” and come after Taiwan President Lai Ching-te called China a “foreign hostile force”. Named “Strait Thunder-2025A”, the drills were in the middle and southern parts of the Taiwan Strait as well as the East China Sea, the military said. The strait is a vital artery for global shipping. The military said it held “long-range live-fire drills” and practised hitting “simulated targets of key ports and energy facilities” during the exercises. Wednesday’s exercises aim to “test the troops’ capabilities” in areas such as “blockade and control, and precision strikes on key targets”, said Senior Colonel Shi Yi, spokesman of the Chinese military’s Eastern Theater Command. China’s Shandong aircraft carrier was also carrying out drills testing the ability to “blockade” Taiwan, the Eastern Theater Command said. Taipei has condemned the Chinese exercises. The island of 23 million people is a potential flashpoint between China and the United States, which is Taiwan’s most important security partner. #ROCArmedForces have deployed mission aircraft, vessels, and shore-based missile systems to closely monitor and maintain situational awareness of #PLA aircraft and ships entering our response zone. pic.twitter.com/BVX7VurPCT The US State Department said Beijing’s “aggressive” military activities and rhetoric towards Taiwan “only serve to exacerbate tensions and put the region’s security and the world’s prosperity at risk”. Chinese leaders vigorously oppose Washington’s support for Taiwan and detest Lai, who they call a “separatist”. Drills in the strait come a day after China sent its army, navy, air and rocket forces to surround Taiwan for exercises Beijing said were aimed at practising for “precision strikes” and a blockade of the island. That prompted Taipei to dispatch its own air and maritime forces as part of a “Rapid Response Exercise”. Taiwan’s defence ministry said Tuesday China had deployed 21 warships around the island, including the Shandong carrier group, along with 71 aircraft and four coast guard vessels. That was the highest number of warships detected during a single day in nearly a year, and the most aircraft since October 2024. China’s Eastern Theater Command kept up its propaganda on Wednesday, posting a “Paralysing Strikes” poster on its Weibo account, showing Chinese forces surrounding Taiwan and firing missiles at the island. Meng Xiangqing, a professor at the PLA National Defence University, warned Taiwan was vulnerable to supply disruptions due to its lack of energy and other resources. “In the end, it will be the regular people of the island who suffer,” Meng said in a video carried by state broadcaster CCTV. Beijing has ramped up military pressure on Taiwan in recent years and held multiple large-scale exercises around the island that are often described as rehearsals for a blockade and seizure of the territory. Tensions have escalated since Lai took office in May 2024 and adopted tougher rhetoric than his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen in defending the island’s sovereignty. While Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign country, only 11 mostly Pacific and Caribbean countries and the Vatican recognise its claim to statehood. Last month, Lai called China a “foreign hostile force” and proposed 17 measures to combat growing Chinese espionage and infiltration. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth vowed “robust, ready and credible deterrence” in the strait during a visit to the region last week. Taipei analyst Wen-Ti Sung said China was using “stress test after stress test” to gauge the strength of US President Donald Trump’s support for Taiwan and other allies in the region. “China is creating occasion after occasion for the Trump administration to publicly show how its support… is weaker or more conditional than in years past,” Sung told AFP. Beijing was also trying to paint Lai as “the provocateur” to get what it wants on Taiwan from Washington, including reduced US support, Eurasia Group’s Amanda Hsiao said. The United States is legally bound to provide arms to Taiwan, but Washington has long maintained “strategic ambiguity” when it comes to whether it would deploy its military to defend the island from a Chinese attack. There have been concerns over Trump’s willingness to protect Taiwan, especially after he upended US support for Ukraine. Communist China claims Taiwan has been part of its territory since “ancient times”, but it has never governed the island. The island was partly or totally ruled at various times by the Dutch, Spanish, China’s Qing dynasty and Japan, and has been inhabited by indigenous tribes for thousands of years.

In its 2025 Hong Kong Policy Act Report issued Monday, the US Department of State said that Beijing and Hong Kong last year “took actions that eroded Hong Kong’s judicial independence and rule of law” and there was “no expectation” of a fair trial for national security cases. It cited the Hong Kong national security committee’s instruction to block overseas witnesses from testifying in jailed Tiananmen crackdown vigil organiser Chow Hang-tung’s national security trial. The report also noted the sentencing of 45 pro-democracy advocates in a landmark national security trial over their unofficial primary election, “despite this being peaceful political activity protected by the Basic Law and recognized in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.” The Hong Kong government hit back with a statement on Tuesday evening, saying it “strongly condemns and rejects the wanton slander about and political attacks” in the US report. It also accused Washington of “blatantly interfering in Hong Kong affairs which are entirely China’s internal affairs.” The 3,300-word English-language statement also pointed to a fresh round of sanctions on Hong Kong officials, saying it “clearly exposed the US’s barbarity under its hegemony, which is exactly the same as its recent tactics in bullying and coercing various countries and regions.” Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Guo Jiakun separately said on Tuesday that the US report was “composed of falsehoods and disinformation” and constituted “grave interference” in China’s and Hong Kong’s affairs. The Hong Kong Policy Act Report, which is compiled and submitted to Congress each year, provides an overview of the state of Hong Kong’s basic rights and freedoms. The latest US report also said that Hong Kong’s homegrown national security legislation, also known as Article 23, which was passed in March last year, had expanded the government’s powers. It said that “there were credible reports that government security services monitored pro-democracy and human rights activists, their families and acquaintances, and journalists in Hong Kong.” It also noted “transnational repression” against Hong Kong democracy advocates living overseas who had arrest warrants and bounties issued against them under Hong Kong’s national security laws. Separate from the 2020 Beijing-enacted security law, the homegrown Safeguarding National Security Ordinance targets treason, insurrection, sabotage, external interference, sedition, theft of state secrets, and espionage. The Safeguarding National Security Ordinance includes “clear definitions of the elements that constitute an offence, only making necessary and reasonable restrictions on basic human rights and freedoms,” the Hong Kong government said on Tuesday. The statement also defended the government’s extraterritorial application of the national security laws, saying it was necessary to pursue those who “blatantly engage in activities endangering national security” against Hong Kong and Beijing.

A bill introduced in the House of Representatives would erect the street sign “Jimmy Lai Way” on a stretch alongside the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Washington’s bustling Dupont Circle area. “We want to remind every HKETO employee of their part in dismantling the freedoms that once made Hong Kong the most vibrant and prosperous city in Asia,” said Representative Chris Smith, the Republican co-chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which examines rights in the country. While Congress has less jurisdiction outside of Washington, the bill would also direct the US Postal Service to deliver mail to Hong Kong’s offices in New York and San Francisco if they are addressed to “1 Jimmy Lai Way” in either city. There was no immediate timetable to act upon the proposal. The bill had co-sponsors from the Democratic Party but met opposition from the capital’s non-voting delegate to Congress, Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton. “No matter how well-intentioned an initiative is, it is never appropriate for members of Congress not elected by DC residents to legislate on local DC matters, particularly quintessentially local ones like street names,” she said. Lai was the founder of the Apple Daily, a now-shuttered Chinese-language newspaper that championed mass demonstrations in 2019 aimed at safeguarding democratic liberties promised when Beijing took control of the former British colony. China quelled dissent after the protests, some of which involved vandalism, including through a tough security law. Lai, now 77, has been behind bars since December 2020. He testified for more than 50 days, concluding last month, as he fights charges of foreign collusion under the law that could carry a sentence of life in prison. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a recent interview said that Lai’s case was a “priority” for him. Rubio on Monday imposed sanctions on Hong Kong’s police chief, justice secretary and other officials on human rights grounds over the crackdown in the city. The bill on the street name calls on Rubio to look at sanctions on additional officials specifically involved in Lai’s detention and prosecution. Renaming streets has long been a means to embarrass countries on their rights records. Russia’s embassy in Washington lies on Boris Nemtsov Plaza, named for the reformist politician killed near the Kremlin in 2015, and the Saudi embassy is on Jamal Khashoggi Way, named for the dissident writer who was strangled to death and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. Both streets were renamed by votes of the DC City Council. But an effort to name the plaza outside of China’s embassy for Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Prize-winning writer and democracy activist who died in prison, floundered after intense opposition from Beijing. Other governments have sometimes acted similarly with the United States. The street outside the US consulate in Kolkata is named for Vietnamese revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh.

Ernest Lee pleaded guilty at the West Kowloon Magistrates’ Courts to the offences on Tuesday, according to court news outlet The Witness. He stood accused of “destroying” lift doors and banners in multiple locations, including pedestrian bridges in Wan Chai and Causeway Bay, between May and December last year. He wrote slogans in Chinese like “Taiwan independence,” a reference to Chinese President Xi Jinping as Winnie the Pooh, and claims that the Chinese Communist Party had brought “disaster” upon Hong Kong, the prosecution said. Lee, a logistics worker, was charged with one count of committing acts with seditious intention and eight counts of criminal damage. He pleaded guilty to the sedition charge and four of the criminal damage counts, with the other four dropped by the prosecution. According to the case details reported by the Witness, police discovered the slogans written in black marker on the lift doors of pedestrian bridges in Wan Chai in May, June, and October last year. In December, a technician inspecting a lift in a bridge connecting Harbour Road and Tonnochy Road in Wan Chai found graffiti written in a black marker, which read: “Chinese Communist Party bandits brought disaster on Hong Kong. They and their families must die.” The technician alerted the police, after which officers reviewed CCTV footage and identified Lee, then 53 years old. Under police caution, Lee admitted to writing the slogans. He told police he was unhappy with the verdicts in the 47 prominent democrats’ national security case and the Yuen Long mob attack case. The latter refers to suspected triad members attacking MTR passengers during the 2019 protests and unrest, which led to protesters and bystanders, including a former opposition lawmaker, being charged and found guilty of rioting. During mitigation, barrister Steven Kwan – representing Lee – said his client was a man of few words and also had autism that runs in his family. Kwan added that Lee did not commit the acts out of revenge or to bring danger to anybody. Judge Victor So, a designated national security judge, said the court could not ignore the defendant’s aim of expressing dissatisfaction with the government and venting his inner hatred. The slogans he wrote also involved cursing the central government and using insulting names to refer to the “motherland,” So said. Separate to the 2020 Beijing-enacted security law, the homegrown Safeguarding National Security Ordinance targets treason, insurrection, sabotage, external interference, sedition, theft of state secrets and espionage. It allows for pre-charge detention of up to 16 days, and suspects’ access to lawyers may be restricted, with penalties involving up to life in prison. Article 23 was shelved in 2003 amid mass protests, remaining taboo for years. But, on March 23, 2024, it was enacted having been fast-tracked and unanimously approved at the city’s opposition-free legislature. The law has been criticised by rights NGOs, Western states and the UN as vague, broad and “regressive.” Authorities, however, cited perceived foreign interference and a constitutional duty to “close loopholes” after the 2019 protests and unrest.

It comes after Raymond Siu stepped down as the city’s top cop on Tuesday. He entered pre-retirement leave after serving for 36 years. Chow said during a press conference on Wednesday that safeguarding national security will remain a top priority for the police under his leadership. “It must be most important and instrumental for us to safeguard the national security. At the same time, [we are] hoping to enhance the national security awareness of the whole community,” he told reporters. Asked why the police needed to strengthen awareness in Hong Kong given already extensive efforts, Chow said that threats remained: “Very often some people are still trying to seek… any loopholes that they can use to instigate some actions to threaten national security,” he said. He also warned of “undercurrents” and “soft resistance” in the art, culture and media sectors. Asked about freedom of assembly in Hong Kong, Chow said such rights are provided for in the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution, but that police will review any applications for demonstration on a case by case basis. “We will evaluate and also conduct threat assessments… [depending] on the events and the capability of the organisers,” he said. Director of Crime and Security Keith Yip will take on Chow’s role, pending approval, according to local media citing sources on Monday. Previously Siu’s deputy, Chow, 52, is known for leading a two-week police operation around the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) during the peak of the 2019 protests and unrest. Pro-democracy demonstrators barricaded themselves on campus, with the operation leading to 1,377 arrests. Chow joined the police force in 1995 as an inspector, according to its website, before being promoted to superintendent in 2010. He served as a criminal intelligence officer at Interpol in France between 2012 and 2013 and then joined the Criminal Intelligence Bureau in 2013, eventually commanding the bureau in 2016. In 2017, he was promoted to district commander of Yau Tsim Mong and became deputy regional commander of Kowloon West in 2019. Further promotions saw him take charge of the Operations Wing and the Personnel Wing. By 2023, he had assumed the No 2 position in the force. Chow is scheduled to hold a press conference at 12.30pm on Wednesday. In a Wednesday press release, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee welcomed Chow’s appointment. “Mr Chow has served in the Hong Kong Police Force for almost 30 years and has extensive experience in criminal investigation, intelligence gathering, policy-making as well as personnel management,” Lee said. “He has a distinguished performance and possesses proven leadership skills. I am confident that he will capably lead the Police Force in meeting the challenges ahead.” He also paid tribute to Siu’s “commendable efforts in maintaining Hong Kong as one of the safest cities in the world.” “He has demonstrated unswerving dedication and determination to safeguarding Hong Kong and upholding the rule of law in dealing with the social unrest. During his tenure, he has also been devoted to introducing strong and effective measures to prevent deception cases and combat criminal activities,” he added. Having taken on the top job in 2021, Siu led the police force through the implementation of two national security laws. Siu was among six top officials sanctioned by the US on Monday, drawing a backlash from the local and national authorities. The sanctions included blocking individuals’ assets in the US and banning them from receiving travel visas. In a statement released in the early hours of Tuesday, the Hong Kong government condemned the US. The US State Department announced the new measures for what Washington said were the officials’ roles in “transnational repression” and “implementing the [Beijing-imposed] National Security Law.” It came after the city issued arrest warrants for 19 individuals currently residing overseas over national security allegations, including pro-democracy activist Joey Siu, a US citizen, as well as others who were granted political asylum in the United States. Crime rose on Siu’s watch. The city logged over 90,000 reported crime cases in 2023 – a 28.9 per cent increase from a year earlier – while last year, it recorded more than 94,700 reported crime cases.

In a letter to parents on Monday, the English Schools Foundation (ESF) CEO Belinda Greer said that the group’s board had approved proposed fee hikes, ranging between HK$650 and HK$750 per month. Annual tuition fees for primary school students, from Year 1 to Year 6, will increase by 4.9 per cent in the 2025-26 academic year, from HK$132,500 to HK$139,000, according to the statement. Meanwhile, secondary school students in Years 7 to 10 will see their tuition fees rise from HK$173,900 to HK$181,100 – up 4.1 per cent. Fees for upper secondary school students, while still subsidised, will also increase. A 4.73 per cent tuition hike will apply to Year 11 students, from HK$152,200 to HK$159,400. Meanwhile, for students in Years 12 and 13, their fees will rise by 4.68 per cent, from HK$160,100 to HK$167,600. Greer gave assurance in the statement that despite the increase, the ESF’s fee level “remains amongst the lowest of any international school or group in Hong Kong.” A recurrent subsidy scheme for ESF schools is gradually being phased out after the foundation accepted a government proposal in 2013 to stop public funding. The ESF began phasing out government funding in the 2016-17 school year and is set to fully complete the process in the 2028-29 school year. Year 10 will not be subsidised in the upcoming school year. Separately, Discovery College, an ESF-operated private international school that does not receive government subsidies, is seeking larger fee hikes of around 5.9 per cent – a monthly increase of HK$900 to HK$1,190 – for both primary and secondary school students. Renaissance College, another unsubsidised private school run by the ESF, plans to raise tuition fees for students from Year 1 to Year 13 by around 4.8 per cent. The ESF is also seeking fee increases at the five international kindergartens it operates, also without government funding, ranging from HK$600 to HK$1,080 per month – the equivalent of a 6.3 to 10 per cent hike. “I know that the Hong Kong economy, like that of the world more generally, continues to face uncertainties,” Greer said. “I want to assure you that our commitment to a prudent ‘best value’ financial model remains resolute.” Last year, the EDB approved the ESF’s application to raise tuition fees by around 4.8 per cent for the current academic year.

The 30-storey tower, still under construction, was to house government offices, but the shaking reduced the structure to a pile of rubble in seconds, killing at least 13 people and injuring nine. It was the deadliest single incident in Thailand after Friday’s 7.7-magnitude quake, with the majority of the kingdom’s 20 fatalities thought to be workers on the building site and hopes fading for around 70 still trapped. Sprawling Bangkok bristles with countless high-rise blocks, but none have reported major damage, prompting many to ask why the block under construction gave way. “We have to investigate where the mistake happened,” said Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who has ordered a probe into the materials and safety standards at the construction site. “What happened from the beginning since it was designed? How was this design approved? This was not the first building in the country,” she told reporters on Saturday. The development near Bangkok’s popular Chatuchak market was a joint project involving China Railway No. 10 Engineering Group (Thailand) — an offshoot of China Railway Group (CREC), one of the world’s largest construction and engineering contractors. Testing of steel rebars — struts used to reinforce concrete — from the site has found that some of the metal used was substandard, Thai safety officials said on Monday. Industry Minister Akanat Promphan announced that a committee would be set up to investigate, saying one supplier of the steel had failed safety tests in December and may have its licence withdrawn. He did not name the supplier. Professor of Civil Engineering at King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang Suchatwee Sunaswat said there were questions to be answered. “We have to look at the design. At the beginning, how they calculate, how they design. And in the rescue mission, how they collect evidence at the same time,” he told reporters on Saturday. The local partner in the project, Italian-Thai Development (ITD) offered condolences on Monday to quake victims but said it was “confident” the incident would not impact its other projects. Beijing-owned building conglomerate CREC is one of the world’s largest construction and engineering contractors, with projects in more than 90 countries and regions, according to its website. The Bangkok construction collapse is not the first time CREC and its subsidiaries have come under fire after deadly incidents. A tide of anger was unleashed at authorities in Serbia following the deaths of 14 people when a roof collapsed in November last year at a train station built by CREC subsidiaries — largely focused on reports of alleged shortcuts made with building projects. Roisai Wongsuban of the Migrant Working Group advocacy organisation said there have been a large number of complaints from migrant workers employed by Chinese companies in Thailand about lax safety standards and poor labour rights. “For Chinese companies we can’t see the human rights due diligence, to see if labour standards are being met,” she told AFP. “There is always a power imbalance between employer and employee.” Bangkok’s construction boom is powered by an army of labourers, a large proportion of them migrant workers from Myanmar, toiling on hot building sites for low pay. The Migrant Working Group has called on Thailand’s labour ministry to hold the employers involved in the construction project criminally liable if they have failed to meet health and safety laws. AFP has asked China Rail No. 10 Engineering Thailand and CREC for comment but has not had a response. An announcement celebrating the completion of the main structure at the Chatuchak construction site, posted on China Rail No. 10’s official WeChat channel, was deleted soon after Friday’s quake. AFP archived the post shortly after the tremors hit but before the page was removed. Local media said that four Chinese nationals were apprehended on Saturday for attempting to retrieve documents from the collapse site. But China is the largest source of foreign direct investment in Thailand, injecting $2 billion into the kingdom in 2024, according to Open Development Thailand, and the government typically handles anything linked to Beijing with kid gloves. Paetongtarn said an investigation into the collapse launched on Monday would not be “specific to one country”. “We do not want one particular country to think we are only keeping eyes on (it),” she said on Tuesday. At a small shelter near the site on Monday, 45-year-old Naruemol Thonglek waited for news of her boyfriend, electrician Kyi Than, who was missing under the enormous mound of concrete and twisted metal being lifted by mechanical diggers. “I’m devastated,” she told AFP. “I’ve never seen anything like this in my entire life.” Bangkok, Thailand Produced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic standards.

Organisers have denied the work is political. Four-second black-and-white clips featuring Badiucao are being intermittently displayed on two LED billboards, where the Australia-based artist is seen silently mouthing a quote from Chairman Mao Zedong. “You must take part in revolution,” is a quote from an essay featured in the 1937 philosophical work On Practice, by Mao, the Chinese Communist Party’s founder. In a Tuesday statement, Badiucao said the quote – which is also the title of his new graphic novel – should “present no problems in the territory, or for anyone in China for that matter.” The Mong Kok billboards are part of Art Innovation Gallery’s “Luminance” outdoor exhibition, which was launched last Friday and brought together artists, designers, and brands. Badiucao, who had used the pseudonym “Andy Chou” for the billboard project, said he wanted to test the law whilst the flagship Art Basel fair was taking place. “Art Basel is a prestige global event — and its value is partly reliant on the ability of artists at the fair and in the greater ecosystem to freely express themselves,” he said. “There is no true creativity without freedom. Anything less is subpar, consumerist, and for the purchase of vapid billionaires and oligarchs. It is thus an indictment of Art Basel when it continues to stage its event in Hong Kong at a time when freedom of expression is under assault in the territory.” It is unclear what Italy-based Art Innovation knew of the stunt. When asked whether they knew of the artist’s true intentions and identity, they did not reply directly. “I am sorry but the work in the exhibition has nothing to do with political messages,” the gallery said in an emailed response, adding there was “no news” surrounding the matter. Without naming them, they included the artists’ original statement, which said the clip “explores the essence of presence – how we experience time, sensation, and awareness in fleeting moments.” Badiucao, born in Shanghai, China, is an award-winning political cartoonist, artist, and rights activist who has held exhibitions in the US, Europe, and Australia. He remained anonymous for years, but showed his face publicly in 2019, saying that the Chinese authorities had already identified him. The “Luminance” outdoor exhibition is set to continue until Friday between 10am and 10pm daily. The clips are being shown on Sai Yeung Choi Street South and Argyle Street in Kowloon’s busy shopping thoroughfare of Mong Kok. “By combining art, technology, and urban visibility, Art Innovation redefines the traditional exhibition concept, transforming LED billboards into true digital canvases,” their press release last Friday said. Other artists featured on the Mong Kok LED boards this year included JungGyu Park, Sinisa K., Philip Giannattasio, Billy Ryan, Mat Voyce, Pacôme Pertant, Marcel van Luit, Elastique., Medina Kasimova & .ART Registry, Bonsai Mirai, Alan Bee, Josh Jen and Ariadna Canaan studio. During Art Week in 2023, the same gallery showcased a digital artist on a SOGO mall video billboard in Causeway Bay. However, he was found to have hidden the names, ages, and jail terms of convicted Hong Kong protesters in the clip. Art Innovation displayed No Rioters, by Patrick Amadon, on a 70 x 20-metre LED screen for several days before it was removed prematurely.

After operating in the Kowloon residential district for almost 16 years, GH Whampoa will host its final screenings on April 9, Golden Harvest said in a Facebook post on Monday night. “With effect from 10 April 2025, GH Whampoa will be closed due to the expiry of tenancy. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused. We hope to see you again at other GH cinemas!” the post read. The four-screen cinema, with more than 1,200 seats, will show four classic Hong Kong films on the evening of April 9: HK$40 for the general public and HK$30 for members. Moviegoers currently can enjoy a 20 per cent discount on snacks purchased at the cinema’s kiosk, while selected snack items will be sold at HK$16 on the cinema’s last day of operation. Holders of tickets from GH Whampoa may also claim a HK$10 discount on snack purchases at other Golden Harvest cinemas from April 10 until the end of the month. GH Whampoa’s ticket sales revenue plunged from around HK$36.7 million in 2019 to HK$6.8 million in 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic began to hit Hong Kong, data from the Hong Kong Film Development Council showed. Between 2020 and 2022, cinemas in Hong Kong had to close intermittently, and capacity limits were imposed due to anti-epidemic regulations. Despite the resumption of normalcy in 2023, cinema revenues remained weak. GH Whampoa, for example, earned around HK$21.3 million that year, still below pre-pandemic levels. Last year, nine local cinemas closed as overall box office receipts in Hong Kong marked the weakest performance since 2011, according to figures compiled by Hong Kong Box Office Limited. Total box office revenue amounted to HK$1.3 billion in 2024 – down 6.2 per cent from 2023, it also said in January. See also: Could box-office record breaker ‘The Last Dance’ signal a new dawn for Hong Kong cinema? As of Tuesday, the Hong Kong Theatres Association’s website showed that it had 53 members: 13 on Hong Kong Island, 20 in Kowloon, and 20 in the New Territories. Golden Harvest Whampoa was still listed as a member. Newport Theatre in Mong Kok announced last month that it would shut its doors after 20 years of operation. Sun Digital, a modern cinema that was added to the historic Sunbeam Theatre in 2012, also closed when curtains fell on the cultural landmark in March.

Taiwan dispatched its own aircraft and ships, and deployed land-based missile systems, in response to the exercises and accused Beijing of being the world’s “biggest troublemaker”. The drills come after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Sunday in Japan that the United States would ensure “credible deterrence” across the Taiwan Strait. China opposes US support for Taiwan, which Beijing insists is part of its territory and has threatened to use force to bring it under its control. Beijing has increased the deployment of fighter jets and naval vessels around Taiwan in recent years to press its claim of sovereignty, which Taipei rejects. China deployed 21 warships around the island, including the Shandong aircraft carrier group, along with 71 aircraft and four coast guard vessels, Taiwan’s defence ministry said. The number of warships was the highest since May last year when 27 navy vessels were reported, according to an AFP tally of the ministry’s daily figures. That was the most recorded since May last year when 27 navy vessels were reported, according to an AFP tally of the ministry’s daily figures. Tensions across the 180-kilometre (112-mile) Taiwan Strait have escalated since Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te took office in May 2024. That was the most recorded since May last year when 27 navy vessels were reported, according to an AFP tally of the ministry’s daily figures. Tensions across the 180-kilometre (112-mile) Taiwan Strait have escalated since Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te took office in May 2024. Chinese leaders loathe Lai, who has been more outspoken than his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen in defending Taiwan’s sovereignty. Lai last month called China a “foreign hostile force” and proposed measures to combat growing Chinese espionage and infiltration. Tuesday’s exercises were aimed at sending a “stern warning and forceful deterrence” to alleged separatists in Taiwan, Beijing said. They involved “sea-air combat-readiness patrols, joint seizure of comprehensive superiority, assault on maritime and ground targets, and blockade on key areas and sea lanes”, said Senior Colonel Shi Yi, spokesman of the Chinese military’s Eastern Theater Command. Beijing’s armed forces “close in on Taiwan Island from multiple directions”, he said. The drills also involved training for “multi-directional precision strikes” around the island, the Eastern Theater Command said in a statement. The Chinese military’s Eastern Theater Command — which oversees operations along the Taiwan Strait — shared a graphic with the title “closing in”. Another graphic shared by the military depicted Lai as an insect being roasted over an open fire. And a video shared by the military on X-like Weibo showed footage of weapons interspersed with animations of Sun Wukong, the legendary Monkey King from the classic Chinese novel “Journey to the West”. The video climaxes with Chinese forces appearing to use satellites to mark targets across Taiwan, before ending with a flurry of rocket explosions while multiple Monkey Kings attack a giant frog monster. China’s coast guard said it also conducted “law enforcement patrols” around the island. “Pursuing ‘Taiwan independence’ means pushing the people of Taiwan into a dangerous situation of war,” Zhu Fenglian, a spokeswoman for Beijing’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said. Taiwan’s Presidential Office condemned “China’s escalatory behaviour”, and Premier Cho Jung-tai said “resorting to displays of military force is not what modern, progressive societies should pursue”. China has carried out multiple large-scale exercises around the island in recent years, often described as rehearsals for a blockade and seizure of the territory. Analysts have speculated that China was more likely to attempt a blockade of Taiwan than launch an all-out invasion, which was riskier and would require a huge military deployment. Taipei military expert Su Tzu-yun told AFP the drills appeared to be of similar size to the “Joint Sword” exercises in May and October. Holding drills straight after Hegseth’s visit to the region showed China was testing the Trump administration, said Lin Ying-yu of Tamkang University. “China wants to test the US’s bottom line ahead of a Trump-Xi summit through military exercises,” Lin told AFP. Taiwan — a powerhouse in semiconductor chip manufacturing — is a potential flashpoint for conflict between China and the United States, which is the island’s most important security partner. While the United States is legally bound to provide arms to Taiwan, Washington has long maintained “strategic ambiguity” when it comes to whether it would deploy its military to defend the island from a Chinese attack. There have been concerns about US President Donald Trump’s willingness to protect Taiwan. Trump said last month that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be “catastrophic”, as the island’s chipmaking titan TSMC announced a $100 billion investment in the United States. The dispute between China and Taiwan dates back to 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang nationalist forces fled to Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil war with Mao Zedong’s communist fighters. Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign country, but has stopped short of declaring formal independence, which is a red line for Beijing. Only 11 countries and the Vatican recognise Taiwan’s claim to statehood. Taipei, Taiwan Produced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic standards.

In a statement released in the early hours of Tuesday, the Hong Kong government said it “strongly condemns” the US for imposing sanctions on Commissioner of Police Raymond Siu, Secretary for Justice Paul Lam, and four other officials involved in national security. It described the move as “tactics in bullying and coercing” other countries and territories and vowed that it “is not intimidated by such despicable behaviour.” The statement was published hours after the US State Department announced the sanctions, with Lam being on the list for what the US said was his role in “implementing the [Beijing-imposed] National Security Law.” The Commissioner’s Office of China’s Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong issued a statement on Tuesday, saying that the sanctions were “blatant interference” in Hong Kong and China’s affairs and that they were “doomed to fail.” Apart from Siu, whose term ends on Tuesday, the list also included two other senior police officials: assistant commissioners Margaret Chiu and Dick Wong. Sonny Au, head of Hong Kong’s Committee for Safeguarding National Security, and Dong Jingwei, a Beijing official appointed to oversee the city’s national security affairs, were on the list as well. Sanctions include blocking individuals’ assets in the US and banning them from receiving travel visas. “Beijing and Hong Kong officials have used Hong Kong national security laws extraterritorially to intimidate, silence, and harass 19 pro-democracy activists who were forced to flee overseas, including a US citizen and four other US residents,” the State Department said in the Monday statement. See also: Hong Kong condemns US decision to extend sanctions against local officials by five years US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a separate statement on Monday that the sanctioned officials include “five individuals for their role as leaders or officials of the Hong Kong government that have engaged in actions or policies that have degraded the autonomy of Hong Kong, including in connection with transnational repression targeting individuals residing in the United States, and one individual for their role in implementing the National Security Law.” Hong Kong has issued arrest warrants for 19 individuals currently residing overseas over national security allegations, including pro-democracy activist Joey Siu, a US citizen, as well as others who were granted political asylum in the United States. In the statement on Tuesday, a Hong Kong government spokesperson said those individuals had endangered national security whilst residing in the US, the UK, and Australia, among other countries. “The US, however, gives cover for [those] who have committed these evil deeds,” the spokesperson said. The US has also breached the “non-interference” principle in international affairs, and the Hong Kong government will continue safeguarding national security in accordance with the law, the spokesperson added. In August 2020, after Beijing imposed the national security law, the US imposed sanctions on 11 officials in Hong Kong, including Chief Executive John Lee, who was then the city’s security chief. Beijing inserted national security legislation directly into Hong Kong’s mini-constitution in June 2020 following a year of pro-democracy protests and unrest. It criminalised subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces and terrorist acts – broadly defined to include disruption to transport and other infrastructure. The move gave police sweeping new powers and led to hundreds of arrests amid new legal precedents, while dozens of civil society groups disappeared. The authorities say it restored stability and peace to the city, rejecting criticism from trade partners, the UN and NGOs.

Lam, of the opposition Democratic Party, was cleared of three counts of disclosing the identity of a person under investigation in February last year. He was initially sentenced to four months in jail in January 2022 for revealing an inquiry into allegations of misconduct against police Superintendent Yau Nai-keung by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). The superintendent was under investigation for his role in the Yuen Long mob attacks. On July 21, 2019, more than 100 rod-wielding men stormed Yuen Long MTR station and attacked passengers, leaving 45 people injured – including Lam, who said he was there to protect residents from the attack. Police were criticised for their alleged inaction over the incident. Siding with Lam in February 2024, the lower appeals court ruled that the city’s bribery laws should not be interpreted broadly to include “any investigation.” The Court of Final Appeal’s decision was split three against two, with an overseas visiting judge among the three who decided to overturn Lam’s conviction on the basis that the ex-lawmaker’s disclosure of the misconduct probe still fell within the scope of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance. In the majority opinion, Justice Roberto Ribeiro, Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, and non-permanent Australian judge James Allsop agreed that Hong Kong’s anti-bribery laws should be interpreted to preserve the antigraft watchdog’s investigations and to “protect the reputation of subject persons.” Such a reading of the law was preferable, as disclosing either the fact that Yau was subject to the investigation – or any details thereof – “may prejudice the investigation,” Ribeiro argued. Cheung agreed, saying that simply revealing the fact that Yau was under investigation had amounted to a prohibited disclosure. Ribeiro, delivering the majority judgment, argued that limiting prohibited disclosures to corruption investigations would be an “unnecessary requirement” that would hamper the statutory purpose of Hong Kong’s antigraft laws. The chief justice concurred, saying: “I do not accept that the narrower construction – which requires disclosure of the fact that the investigation concerns a [bribery] offence – adequately serves the statutory purpose of ensuring the secrecy of corruption investigations.” Allsop also agreed, rejecting the alternative interpretation that Lam could only be found guilty if he had disclosed an investigation for bribery instead of misconduct. He argued that the alternative reading “tends to limit or undermine” the law’s ability to protect the integrity and efficacy of investigations. A former chief justice of the Federal Court of Australia, Allsop was appointed to Hong Kong’s apex court in May. He is the newest overseas non-permanent judge to join the top court’s panel. Last year, five overseas judges left, including one who said Hong Kong was “slowly becoming an authoritarian state” under the Beijing-imposed national security law. Meanwhile, in a dissenting opinion, Justices Joseph Fok and Johnson Lam argued for an interpretation of the law in line with the lower appeals court’s ruling, suggesting that disclosing the identity of a subject under investigation is only prohibited if they are under a bribery probe. The intent of the law is to protect the integrity of antigraft investigations, “rather than an ICAC investigation in general,” Fok argued. Agreeing with Fok, Lam said that the law prohibited disclosures that “objectively brought about a disclosure” of a bribery investigation.

Volunteers at the stadium estimated that 60 per cent of the 860,000 pieces of disposable tableware generated during the three-day tournament were paper cups, the green group said on Monday – a day after the event concluded. With the stadium banning visitors from bringing drinking containers, the consumption of paper cups was “alarming,” said Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam at a press conference, adding that Kai Tak Sports Park’s sustainability efforts were simply a “façade.” “If waste reduction is to be realised, reusable cups are definitely the right solution,” Tam said. This year marked the first time that the 50,000-seat Kai Tak Stadium – the centrepiece of Kai Tak Sports Park, inaugurated in early March – hosted the Sevens, previously held at the Hong Kong Stadium in Causeway Bay. The government has touted the sports park, which cost HK$30 billion to build, as a “state-of-the-art” venue for holding large-scale events in a bid to boost tourism amid the city’s slow recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Greenpeace made similar calls in the past – as early as January – saying it was disappointing that the venue had prohibited spectators from bringing their own drinking containers. On March 9, it said the Kai Tak Arena’s management had “violated its own rules” by providing plastic bottled water to VIPs at a snooker tournament while banning people from bringing drinks into the venue. The group also said on Monday that glass and plastic bottles, as well as canned drinks, were seen in the stadium’s corporate box, adding that the sports park had “again violated its own rules” and exhibited “double standards.” When the Hong Kong Stadium allowed reusable cups in 2019, the Sevens tournament generated 300,000 fewer disposable cups, Greenpeace said, citing figures from Hong Kong China Rugby, the sport’s governing body in Hong Kong and the organiser of the tournament. Similar arrangements were available at the 2023 and 2024 tournaments as well, the NGO said. Greenpeace also cited sources as saying that the rugby union had offered to provide reusable cups to Kai Tak Stadium, but the arrangement fell through. The group said it had enquired with the rugby union and the sports park’s management, but, as of Monday morning, it had not received any response. It also urged Kai Tak Sports Park to explain to the public why reusable cups were not used during the tournament. HKFP has contacted the stadium for comment. Separately, Kowloon City District Councillor Cheung King-fan said he received noise complaints from residents living in the vicinity of the sports park. Cheung told RTHK on Monday that he planned to address those concerns with the district council and the Environmental Protection Department, which oversees noise pollution complaints. Attended by more than 110,000 spectators, the Hong Kong Sevens came to an end on Sunday, with Argentina’s men winning their first title in the city by beating France 12-7. New Zealand clinched a victory in the women’s division for the third straight year, defeating Australia 26-19. The stadium is gearing up for Coldplay’s concerts next week. The British band will play four sold-out shows, marking the first major international music act to perform at the venue.

A flight control tower and hangar were built in the 1930s, when commercial flights began. The airport was expanded in the 1950s with a new runway on land reclaimed from the harbour. By the 1990s, night flight curfews, building restrictions in Kowloon, pollution and noise forced the colonial government to seek an alternative location to replace the ageing airport. On July 6, 1998, a small ceremony celebrating the end of the airport was held inside the control tower after a final Cathay flight flew from Kai Tak to the new airport at Chek Lap Kok. Richard Siegel, the then-director of civil aviation, famously said “Goodbye Kai Tak, and thank you” as he switched off the runway lights for the last time. Its airport codes were transferred to the new airport on Lantau. Today, the site is home to a cruise ferry terminal. Below are shots from AFP photographers documenting the final days of Kowloon City’s iconic old airport.
