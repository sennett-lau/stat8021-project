The Shenzhen-based firm has emerged in recent years as the clear leader in China’s highly competitive EV market, which is the largest in the world. It is also increasingly seeking new growth channels abroad, vowing to conquer the European market with a new compact electric model and super-fast charging capabilities to rival continental brands. BYD recorded 777.1 billion yuan (US$107.2 billion) in revenue for 2024, a statement published Monday evening at the Shenzhen stock exchange showed. That figure eclipsed the US$97.7 billion in revenue last year announced previously by Tesla. The Chinese juggernaut’s push into Europe comes at a challenging juncture for Tesla, whose sales in the continent have dropped following CEO Elon Musk’s support for far-right political groups there. BYD’s revenue results represent a 29 percent increase from the previous year and outperformed a Bloomberg forecast of 766 billion yuan. Meanwhile, BYD’s net profit last year amounted to 40.3 billion yuan, up 34 percent from 2023 and reaching a record high. In a further promising sign, the company’s net profit in the final quarter of the year reached a record amount of 15 billion yuan, the stock filing showed. BYD — which adopts the English slogan “Build Your Dreams” — has enjoyed a giddy few months of surging sales disclosures and soaring stock prices. It said in January that it sold nearly 4.3 million vehicles last year, up more than 40 percent from the previous year. Monthly sales also jumped 161 percent in February to 318,000 units, easily outpacing a steep decline at Tesla over the same period. This month, BYD’s Hong Kong-listed shares rose to a record high after the firm unveiled new battery technology it says can charge a vehicle in the same time it takes to fill up a petrol car. The “Super e-Platform” battery and charging system boasts peak speeds of 1,000 kilowatts and allows cars to travel up to 470 kilometres (292 miles) after a five-minute charge, according to the company. Tesla’s Superchargers, by contrast, currently offer charging speeds of 500 kilowatts. BYD Vice-President Stella Li said last week that “registration numbers will jump” in Europe during March and April. The group has launched major advertising campaigns including sponsorship of last year’s European Championships in football and has opened numerous new showrooms across the continent. However, geopolitical and trade tensions between Beijing and Western capitals threaten to cast a shadow over the company’s global ambitions. BYD is a key player in a new generation of Chinese automotive giants to have benefited from generous support by Beijing, which has poured vast state funds into the sector. The approach has given domestic firms a critical edge in the race to provide cheaper, more fuel-efficient EVs over leading US automakers, which have not always enjoyed such state largesse. See also: China’s BYD overtakes Tesla as top all-electric vehicle maker EU authorities are reportedly investigating whether the Chinese government provided unfair subsidies for BYD’s first European factory, in Hungary, where electric car production is scheduled to start late this year. Li told AFP last week that the company would be “very transparent” and was willing to cooperate with any investigation. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has recently imposed higher blanket tariffs on Chinese imports, adding to an existing move by his predecessor Joe Biden that effectively bars the use of Chinese technology in smart cars. BYD’s publication of strong results comes after Tesla announced lower than expected profits for the fourth quarter of 2024 in late January. The decline capped a mixed year for Tesla in which Trump ally Musk’s big bet on US electoral politics was countered by profit pressures, as the firm’s streak of annual car volume growth came to an end.

Greenblatt – CEO of the ADL – was due to speak on the “dangers of antisemitism and online hate speech” at the art faculty’s School of Modern Languages and Cultures. However, an online petition urging the university to rescind the invitation garnered over 1,000 signatures. It is unclear if the talk is proceeding behind closed doors or online. Neither the faculty, department, nor HKU responded to HKFP’s repeated enquiries. A small group of demonstrators held a protest late Tuesday morning at HKU’s Run Run Shaw Tower, where the talk was set to take place. They were quickly surrounded and escorted off campus by more than a dozen HKU staff members. HKU also called in police, who ID’ed the protesters and HKFP. The petition accused Greenblatt – a former special assistant to former US president Barack Obama – of placing “opposition to Israel on a par with white supremacy as a source of antisemitism, upsetting many grassroots activists and Jewish advocacy groups critical of Israeli policy.” In 2022, Greenblatt claimed that “anti-Zionism is antisemitism” during a speech to ADL leaders. Israeli philosopher Chaim Gans describes Zionism, which aims to establish a Jewish state, as “fundamentally an ethnocultural nationalism.” Other scholars call Zionism “the colonialisation of Palestine.” Gaza’s Health Ministry said last week that over 50,000 people have been killed in the enclave since the latest conflict with Israel began in 2023. However, The Lancet medical journal has said the actual death toll may be up to 41 per cent higher. The latest bombardment against the Palestinian territory was sparked when militant group Hamas took around 250 hostages and killed at least 1,139 people on October 7, 2023. The ADL – headquartered in New York – has come under fire for defending an apparent Nazi salute by US entrepreneur Elon Musk at a political rally in January, calling it “an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm.” The petition also pointed out that the group’s former head had criticised Greenblatt for failing to condemn Donald Trump’s “grotesque spectacle of antisemitism, racism, xenophobia and misogyny” at a rally last October when he was a presidential candidate. “In essence, the [ADL] has foregone much of its historical mission to fight antisemitism in favour of doing advocacy for Israel,” the petition said. “Therefore, we strongly urge HKU to withdraw its invitation, for his dividing views, one sided pro-Israeli bias and hate speech.” An open letter was also posted to an HKU Reddit forum, accusing Greenblatt of equating anti-Zionism to antisemitism and comparing the Arab keffiyeh – a traditional scarf in Arab countries – to the Nazi swastika. The ADL did not respond to HKFP’s enquiries on Monday. Greenblatt is also due to speak at the Ohel Leah Synagogue in Midlevels on Wednesday at a paid-entry fireside chat. Although the webpage advertising the event had been removed as of Tuesday, the synagogue told HKFP that the talk would proceed. Last year, the International Court of Justice – the principal judicial body of the United Nations – ruled that Israel’s acts in Gaza could amount to genocide. Israel has denied the claims. The UN-backed International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants last November for Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu and ex-defence chief Yoav Gallant, together with a former Hamas commander, over allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

The announcement comes after a fire broke out on an Air Busan plane on January 28 during take-off at South Korea’s Gimhae International Airport. The plane was preparing to depart for Hong Kong – all on board were evacuated safely, though seven were injured. Initial investigations suggest a portable power bank may have exploded in an overhead luggage compartment. Cathay Pacific said earlier this month that it would make “no change” to its policy on portable chargers. Last Thursday, a Hong Kong Airlines flight en route to Hong Kong was forced to make an emergency landing after a fire broke out in an overhead compartment, media reported. Passengers suspected it was caused by a power bank. Airlines have been banning lithium-ion batteries from check-in luggage for years, with some now banning them from in-cabin use or stowage in overhead lockers. Since the Air Busan fire, Singapore Airlines and its subsidiary Scoot, Taiwan-based EVA Air and China Airlines, as well as Thai Airways, have joined a list of carriers prohibiting passengers from using or charging power banks during flights. “For any queries, passengers are advised to check with relevant airlines on the latest regulations before their flight,” the CAD added on Monday.

Addressing the Legislative Council’s (LegCo) manpower panel on Monday, Assistant Commissioner for Labour Raymond Liang said that the government supported non-legislative solutions to bolster protections for the city’s delivery workers. “We have been following this direction, and we are very supportive of it,” Liang told lawmaker Lam Chun-sing, chair of the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions. Lam had asked Liang whether the authorities could “firmly encourage” companies to provide better accident insurance coverage. The lawmaker is calling for the creation of a third legal category recognising the hybrid status of delivery workers. However, delivery workers themselves are split on whether to seek better protections through legislative means. According to survey findings presented at the LegCo meeting, more than 36 per cent of delivery workers supported a non-legally binding approach, while over 34 per cent supported legislation. Delivery workers do not enjoy the same labour protections that full-time employees do, as Hong Kong law stipulates that delivery workers are considered to be self-employed contractors. The legal ambiguity of delivery workers’ employment status stems from flexible work arrangements that allow them to sign on and off whenever they like, Undersecretary for Labour and Welfare Ho Kai-ming said during the LegCo meeting on Monday. Ho added that the government would have to study further how to ensure that delivery workers retain that flexibility while strengthening accident insurance coverage. He also said that they would formulate a “way forward” within a year. But the fact that workers want flexibility does not mean they should not enjoy legal protections granted to employees, the Riders’ Rights Concern Group said in a statement shortly after the LegCo meeting. Meanwhile, other lawmakers on the panel slammed the authorities over a separate survey released last week, saying the results were “stating the obvious,” only proving what people already knew. The survey, conducted by the Census and Statistics Department, laid out findings on delivery workers’ income and working hours, as well as whether they relied on making deliveries as their main income source. The concern group criticised the survey, saying it had neglected ethnic minority delivery workers, who tend to work full-time. Underestimating that figure could create the false impression that fewer, less rigorous regulations were needed, they added. The government’s survey estimated there were 12,900 delivery workers in the city, without specifying the ethnic make-up. The rights group also said the report lacked analysis, for instance, between working hours and income. Two weeks ago, delivery platform Deliveroo said it was pulling out of the Hong Kong market next month. According to the concern group, the move may result in further labour exploitation owing to the food delivery duopoly it leaves behind. Apart from Deliveroo, foodpanda and Keeta are currently serving the local market.

The group – HK Anti-war Mobilization – told HKFP on Sunday that the consulate called the police, who searched and ID’ed the five activists, warning them not to violate the security law. “Over the past week, Israel has torn apart the ceasefire agreement, first suspending the exchange of hostages, then shutting off water and electricity to Gaza, then relaunching the bombardment of Gaza overnight on Tuesday (18th), brutally killing 404 people,” the group said in a statement. “[W]e stand before you today to express our support for the liberation of Palestine and for anti-war activists worldwide, who are being slaughtered, suppressed and silenced.” See also: ‘It’s mostly women and children’: Hong Kong surgeon speaks of treating wounded Palestinians in Gaza Gaza’s Health Ministry said last week that over 50,000 people had been killed in the Palestinian territory since the latest conflict began in early October 2023. However, The Lancet medical journal has said the actual death toll may be up to 41 per cent higher. According to a UN report, the majority of verified victims were women and children. The latest conflict started when Hamas gunmen launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, killing at least 1,139 people and taking around 250 hostages to Gaza. In retaliation, Israel vowed it would destroy Hamas and carried out a bombardment campaign on the Gaza Strip for more than a year. Last Tuesday, a ceasefire – in place since January 19 – was shattered as Israel began a fresh assault on Gaza. Israel has urged the release of dozens of hostages still remaining in the war-torn enclave. Outside the US consulate on Sunday, the activists held placards saying: “The West is complicit in Israel’s genocide” and “Make fascists afraid.” Their statement added: “Western governments, led by the United States, have ignored the voices of their citizens and become complicit in the genocide of Palestinians, furthering Israel’s racist and colonialist aims.” The group said they were not surprised that police had been called in on Sunday. “The US government is suppressing [the] pro-Palestine movement because the US is aligning with Israel to conduct the genocide against Palestinians,” it said. They said that the police “reminded us not to violate the national security law, not to contain any sedition content in our slogans, and not to cover our face under [the] face-covering regulation,” as they searched and took down the identity card details of the activists. In response, the US consulate told HKFP on Monday that the five were blocking their driveway and it had to ensure the safety of its staff and facilities. “The protesters were in front of the consulate vehicle gate, posing a safety and security risk for themselves and consulate staff,” it said. “We fully support the rights of citizens to protest peacefully and safely. Protests near the consulate are a common occurrence.” A year ago, US Consul General Gregory May said on Facebook that he supported the rights of protesters outside the diplomatic mission. “[W]e stand up for fundamental freedoms and human rights. While I respectfully disagree with these visitors’ views, I fully support their right to protest peacefully,” he said. In an emailed response on Monday, police told HKFP that they “received a report at about 2pm on March 23 that there were five people conducting a public meeting outside 26 Garden Road, Central. Upon Police arrival, the five people were reminded to ensure that the public meeting should be conducted in accordance with the law.” The five demonstrators were also calling on the US to release student activist Mahmoud Khalil. Khalil, a permanent resident of the United States and a lead negotiator for Columbia University’s pro-Palestine campus occupation, was detained by US immigration enforcement on March 8 upon orders by the State Department to revoke his visa. “The unjust detention of Khalil showed that the US doesn’t care about justice and freedom at all,” HK Anti-war Mobilization said. “The US government is cracking down on the pro-Palestinian movement on all fronts, fearing that the people will tell the truth about the genocide,” the group also said. “Ironically, the legislation used to arrest Khalil was the same one used by the US government in the 1950s to block Holocaust survivors in Eastern Europe from entering the US,” the protest group said.

The discussions in Tokyo were billed as a chance to improve historically frosty relations against a backdrop of US trade tariffs, North Korea’s missile activities and the Ukraine war. But Japan on Monday took exception to a Chinese statement that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi that he “respects the positions elaborated by the Chinese side”. Chief government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi said Japan had “protested to the Chinese side… and asked to immediately remove the inaccurate statement”. “Since this is a diplomatic exchange, I will refrain from disclosing the details, including the Chinese response. It is regrettable that an announcement different from the facts was issued,” Hayashi told a regular briefing. “Is it not a normal thing for countries to respect each other’s positions in their interactions with each other?,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said on Monday when asked about Japan’s protest. “As far as I know, this important and beneficial meeting and interaction between China and Japan embodied this spirit,” he said. The talks on Saturday followed a rare summit in May in Seoul and came ahead of a mooted state visit to Japan by China’s President Xi Jinping. Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya said he, Wang and South Korea’s Cho Tae-yul “had a frank exchange of views on trilateral cooperation and regional international affairs… and confirmed that we will promote future-orientated cooperation”. “The international situation has become increasingly severe, and it is no exaggeration to say that we are at a turning point in history,” Iwaya said. Patricia M. Kim, a foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that while “trilateral dialogues have been ongoing for over a decade”, this round “carries heightened significance” due to the new US position.

Authorities are considering increasing the fees for A&E services at public hospitals from a standard fee of HK$180, adopting a two-tier system, under which patients that do not require urgent treatment may have to pay up to HK$400, local media reported on Monday. Hong Kong’s public hospitals classify patients attending A&E departments into five categories: critical, emergency, urgent, semi-urgent, and non-urgent. Provisional figures showed that around 2 million people attended Hong Kong’s A&E services in 2023, with over 95 per cent classified as urgent, semi-urgent, or non-urgent. Citing unnamed sources, the reports said that patients classified as critical or emergency would be treated for free, while those belonging to the other three categories would pay between HK$300 and HK$400, putting the fee on par with the average charge of a private clinic visit. The reports come a day before Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau is due to hold a press conference to disclose details of the fee reform. Hong Kong last raised the fee for A&E services at public hospitals from HK$100 to HK$180 in 2017. Meanwhile, Franklin Lam, a government adviser who sits on the Hospital Authority’s Governance and Structure Reform Committee, told some media outlets on Monday that Hong Kong’s healthcare system was not sustainable given an ageing population and that fee reform was needed. Hong Kong is also among the most generous territories in the world in terms of public subsidies for medical care, Lam added. “The Hong Kong government covers more than 97 per cent of public medical expenses. In other words, for a service that costs HK$100, the patient only pays a little more than HK$2,” he said in Cantonese. In comparison, Singapore pays for about 80 per cent of healthcare costs for residents most in need, Lam said. Authorities are also considering extra charges for specific services such as CT and MRI scans at public hospitals, which are currently covered in full by the government. Lo earlier suggested that non-urgent patients would have to pay part of the fees under the reforms. But media reports on Monday said that there would likely be an annual cap for the extra service charges to avoid causing excessive pressure on chronic patients. Lam said the fee hikes would be kept at an “affordable level” for an average household and that residents would benefit from a more sustainable system. “Residents need to understand that everyone is on board the ship of the public healthcare system, and that there is no free rider,” he said. Some new charges are expected to begin in six months, but the full implementation of the fee reforms could take up to five years, according to the media reports.

Greenblatt is due to speak on the “dangers of antisemitism and online hate speech” at the art faculty’s School of Modern Languages and Cultures, though the webpage advertising the talk appeared to have been removed on Monday. HKU has not responded to HKFP’s emailed enquiries and calls went unanswered. As of Monday afternoon, more than 890 people had signed the online petition, accusing Greenblatt – a former special assistant to former US president Barack Obama – of placing “opposition to Israel on a par with white supremacy as a source of antisemitism, upsetting many grassroots activists and Jewish advocacy groups critical of Israeli policy.” In 2022, Greenblatt claimed that “anti-Zionism is antisemitism” during a speech to ADL leaders.  Israeli philosopher Chaim Gans describes Zionism, which aims to establish a Jewish state, as “fundamentally an ethnocultural nationalism.” Other scholars call Zionism “the colonialisation of Palestine.” The petition went on to say that Wikipedia considers the ADL to be “generally unreliable” on the Palestine-Israeli conflict. Gaza’s Health Ministry said last week that over 50,000 people have been killed in the enclave since the latest conflict with Israel began in 2023. However, The Lancet medical journal has said the actual death toll may be up to 41 per cent higher. The latest bombardment against the Palestinian territory was sparked when militant group Hamas took around 250 hostages and killed at least 1,139 people on October 7, 2023. The ADL – headquartered in New York – has come under fire for defending an apparent Nazi salute by US entrepreneur Elon Musk at a political rally in January, calling it “an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm.” The petition also pointed out that the group’s former head had criticised Greenblatt for failing to condemn Donald Trump’s “grotesque spectacle of antisemitism, racism, xenophobia and misogyny” at a rally last October when he was a presidential candidate. “In essence, the [ADL] has foregone much of its historical mission to fight antisemitism in favour of doing advocacy for Israel,” the petition said. “Therefore, we strongly urge HKU to withdraw its invitation, for his dividing views, one sided pro-Israeli bias and hate speech.” HKFP has contacted the ADL for comment. An open letter was also posted to an HKU Reddit forum, accusing Greenblatt of equating anti-Zionism to antisemitism and comparing the Arab keffiyeh – a traditional scarf in Arab countries – to the Nazi swastika. It also urged HKU to axe the talk, saying that “asking Mr. Greenblatt to deliver a speech on hate speech is at the least ironic, and will create unnecessary hatred against students from different backgrounds studying in HKU. If he continues with his usual attacks against Arabs, Iranians, and anyone who criticizes Israel, this will cause friction between students of different national and ethnic backgrounds.” A first-year student studying in the art faculty, who gave their name only as Liu, said they had signed the petition anonymously. “The ADL has a history of labelling criticism of Israel and the organization itself as antisemitism,” they said. “HKU’s pro-Palestine student-led events have been toned down in the name of neutrality, while a Zionist as well known as Greenblatt is allowed an official event backed by a school department.” HKFP has learned that protests have been planned to coincide with the HKU event. Greenblatt is also due to speak at the Ohel Leah Synagogue in Midlevels on Wednesday at a paid-entry fireside chat. Last year, the International Court of Justice – the principal judicial body of the United Nations – ruled that Israel’s acts in Gaza could amount to genocide. Israel has denied the claims. The UN-backed International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants last November for Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu and ex-defence chief Yoav Gallant, together with a former Hamas commander, over allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

The 21 patients reported symptoms of vomiting, diarrhoea, and fever last Friday, a day after they arrived in Zhaoqing, a city in Guangdong Province, for a three-day exchange trip, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said on Sunday. According to the CHP, a total of 135 teachers and students from a secondary school in Tsing Yi took part in the study tour. Local media reported that the school was Po Leung Kuk Lo Kit Sing (1983) College. Eighteen infected individuals sought medical attention in Zhaoqing, eight of whom tested positive for norovirus. All patients are in a stable condition and have been discharged, the disease prevention and control agency said. A preliminary probe by the CHP found that the patients had not consumed any common food items apart from the group meals. There was also no acute gastroenteritis outbreak in the school recently. “After analysis of the onset time of the cases, at this stage, the CHP could not preliminarily rule out that the cases were infected by consuming contaminated food,” a statement from the CHP read. The local health agency said it would continue to conduct epidemiological investigations, including collecting and testing stool specimens from the cases. It was the latest case of gastroenteritis outbreaks reported this month involving students and teachers who visited mainland China. On March 11, the CHP reported that 52 teachers and students from three secondary schools developed acute gastroenteritis symptoms after travelling to Shaoguan, Guangdong Province. The number of patients rose to 55, the CHP said on March 17. The schools affected were Sha Tin Government Secondary School, Lok Sin Tong Ku Chiu Man Secondary School, and TWGHs Chen Zao Men College. On March 17, the CHP reported another cluster involving six students from a Kwun Tong secondary school who showed gastroenteritis symptoms after visiting Xiamen, Fujian Province, between March 13 and 15. According to local media, the school was FDBWA Szeto Ho Secondary School. On Sunday, the CHP also warned that apart from mainland China, gastroenteritis outbreaks were reported in popular travel destinations such as Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan. Most of the outbreaks were caused by norovirus, which can be transmitted through eating contaminated food, the CHP said. The number of norovirus infections also rose locally since the end of last December and “remained at a relatively high level in recent months,” it said. “Members of the public should remain vigilant and maintain personal, environmental and food hygiene at all times to minimise the risk of being infected while travelling,” the CHP said.

Relations between the world’s two largest economies have plunged in recent weeks, as blanket tariffs imposed by Trump threaten China’s trade prospects. Premier Li Qiang’s comments came during a meeting with Trump supporter Steve Daines, a Republican senator from Montana. His visit has been viewed as a bid to ease strained relations, with an eye toward setting up a summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. “Our two sides need to choose dialogue over confrontation, win-win cooperation over zero-sum competition,” Li told Daines. CEOs of major firms including FedEx, Pfizer and Qualcomm were also present. Li said he hoped Washington would “work together with China to promote the steady, sound and sustainable development” of relations. Earlier on Sunday, Li told the China Development Forum that Beijing would pursue economic globalisation despite “fragmentation”, a thinly veiled reference to trade turmoil sparked by Trump. Chinese leaders have been attempting to steer a shaky economy onto a more stable path since the end of the pandemic, particularly by boosting consumption. They are seeking to position the country as a defender of the multilateral economic system, as Trump wages tariff wars with major US trading partners including China, Canada and Mexico. “China will firmly stand on the correct side of history, that of fairness and justice, and act in a righteous manner amid the rough waters of the times,” Li said at the annual forum, attended by business leaders including Apple CEO Tim Cook. Beijing will “adhere to the correct direction of economic globalisation, practice true multilateralism and strive to be a force for stability and certainty”, Li said. In an apparent reference to renewed trade wars sparked by Trump, Li said that “global economic fragmentation is intensifying” and that “instability and uncertainty are on the rise”. Talks were also expected to discuss the flow of the deadly drug fentanyl and its precursor chemicals from China into the United States. Trump says his new tariffs on China are due to Beijing’s failure to stem shipments of the chemicals, which underpin a devastating drug crisis. Beijing insists it has already cracked down on the illicit production and trade of drugs, describing the issue as one for Washington to solve. Daines on Saturday also met with Vice Premier He Lifeng, a close advisor to President Xi Jinping on economic matters. During his meeting with Daines, He said that China “firmly opposes the politicisation, weaponisation and instrumentalisation of economic and trade issues”. The vice premier added that China was willing to “engage in candid dialogue” with the United States, saying they had “many common interests and broad space for cooperation”. The tariffs imposed by Trump amount to a 20 percent blanket hike on Chinese overseas shipments to the United States. China’s exports reached record heights last year, but observers warn that turbulence in the global trading system could soon force Beijing to find other ways to boost activity. Beijing says it is targeting growth this year of around five percent — the same as last year and a goal considered ambitious by many economists.

The 20-year-old wild card upset Shelton, the 13th seed in the tournament, in a thrilling match on Saturday local time, winning 7-6(3), 2-6, and 7-6(5). With the victory, Wong – ranked 182th in the world – proceeds to the third round at an event of ATP Masters 1000, one of top tennis tournaments. “I always trust myself to play in these big stages,” Wong said in a post-match interview. “This is for you Hong Kong.” “My parents, my coaches, my team. They really helped me a lot from highs and lows. They know that I’m struggling and came in here, not easy,” he said. He added in Cantonese: “I know Hong Kong tennis is great!” Wong already made history with his victory against Daniel Altmaier of Germany in the first round on Friday, becoming the first ever Hong Kong player to win at the Masters 1000. He will next face Adam Walton of Australia on Monday. The pair previously met in September 2024 in Thailand, where Wong emerged on top with a 6-4, 6-4 win. Former world No. 1 Rafael Nadal congratulated Wong on social media platform X on Sunday, saying: “There is a lot of effort behind these victories.” “We are very proud of you, Coleman!” Nadal wrote. “A historic win for Hong Kong.” There is a lot of effort behind these victories.

In the final set, the Hongkonger let slip a 5-2 lead but recovered at tie-break to get past Shelton into the round of 32. His father, Bruce Wong, told Commercial Radio on Monday that his son was “at a low point” in the past two to three months but the young athlete had been thrilled at the prospect of playing against Shelton. “He said: ‘It is really exciting to play [Shelton]… Maybe I can come out on top.’ The stronger the opponent is, the more excited he is,” the father said in Cantonese, adding that seeing his son’s victory on Saturday “felt like a dream.” Support HKFP  |  Policies & Ethics  |  Error/typo?  |  Contact Us  |  Newsletter  | Transparency & Annual Report | Apps Help safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team HKFP has an impartial stance, transparent funding, and balanced coverage guided by an Ethics Code and Corrections Policy.

Lai, who founded the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, stands accused of taking part in a “conspiracy to collude with foreign forces” under the national security legislation and conspiring to publish “seditious” materials. The Guardian called the top court’s ruling an “obscure legal development” and quoted several legal experts, including Jonathan Sumption, a British judge who previously said Hong Kong was “slowly becoming a totalitarian state”, days after he quit the CFA last year. In The Guardian‘s article, Sumption was quoted as saying that the ruling “tells us quite a lot about the view of the rule of law taken by the executive.” Tang wrote in his letter that there was “nothing obscure” about the top court’s verdict. Lai’s “application for leave to appeal was dismissed through a summary procedure because it was wholly devoid of merits,” he wrote. “We reject the use of such biased and misleading language to cast aspersions against the court’s professionalism and impartiality,” the security chief added. The CFA’s judgement last week was the latest development in the long court saga sparked by Lai’s plan to hire the British lawyer in 2022. A specialist in human rights law, Owen is not qualified to practice in the city, requiring permission in order to represent clients in the courts. At first, Owen was permitted by the High Court to represent Lai in October 2022. That decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal and the Court of Final Appeal. In November 2022, hours after the top court’s ruling, Chief Executive John Lee requested Beijing to issue an interpretation of the national security law, which empowered the national security committee – chaired by Lee himself – to decide whether a foreign lawyer could be allowed to take part in national security proceedings on a case by case basis. In full: Explainer: Beijing’s first interpretation of Hong Kong’s national security law The British lawyer was barred after Lee said allowing him to be involved in Lai’s national security case was “contrary to the interests of national security.” According to The Guardian article, the “issue at the heart of Lai’s appeal was not the visa” but the fact that the national security committee’s decisions cannot be legally challenged. The report also quoted former University of Hong Kong law professor Michael C Davis, who said the top court had “surely missed an opportunity to [rein] in what has become excessive resort to national security claims and to better articulate the boundaries, if any, of the committee’s immunity from review.” Tang wrote that the introduction of a system for “ad hoc admission in national security cases” was “more favourable than most other jurisdictions, including the UK.” There are more than 100 senior counsels, 1,600 barristers, and 13,000 solicitors “admitted in Hong Kong and available” and the public had a right to choose their own representation, he added. Lai’s trial had entered its 145th day when it was adjourned earlier this month to allow the prosecution and defence to prepare their closing arguments, set to be heard in July. The trial – originally expected to take 80 days – began in December 2023. The media mogul faces up to life imprisonment if he is found guilty. Beijing inserted national security legislation directly into Hong Kong’s mini-constitution in June 2020 following a year of pro-democracy protests and unrest. It criminalised subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces and terrorist acts – broadly defined to include disruption to transport and other infrastructure. The move gave police sweeping new powers and led to hundreds of arrests amid new legal precedents, while dozens of civil society groups disappeared. The authorities say it restored stability and peace to the city, rejecting criticism from trade partners, the UN and NGOs.

The Consumer Council told HKFP on Sunday that as of 11pm Saturday, it had received 25 complaints over the invalid tickets. It also urged affected ticket holders to file a complaint along with proof of their transaction. Coldplay is scheduled to perform for four nights at the Kai Tak Sports Park in the second week of April. According to screenshots of an email from Cityline circulating on social media, the ticket platform told customers that a number of HK$1,399 standing tickets were voided due to “discrepancies” in printing. Ticket holders said the words “VIP-FLORIS” were printed on the invalid tickets – apparently indicating that they had been assigned the wrong ticket category. According to concert organiser Live Nation’s website, one category called the Floris Early Entry Experience, priced at HK$2,799, includes one standing ticket and other perks, such as early entry to the pitch, a Coldplay gift item, and a Coldplay wristband. In a statement published on its website and on Instagram, Cityline said: “Regarding the inaccurate information printed on the [Coldplay concerts’] HK$1,399 standing tickets, the ticketing platform Cityline has apologized for the incident and is arranging for ticket holders to exchange their tickets.” On Saturday, Cityline also issued an apology in AI-generated videos in both English and Cantonese, posted on Instagram. It said it would open ticket exchange locations in Hong Kong and mainland China, as well as give a full refund of HK$150 ticket handling fees to affected customers. According to the ticketing platform, misprinted tickets can be exchanged in Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Shenzhen from Monday to April 7, while on-site service counters will be available during show dates. It is also looking into providing ticket exchanges via courier. The ticketing platform did not provide any reason for the misprint, however. HKFP has reached out for comment. The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau said on Saturday that it was “highly concerned” about the ticketing errors and that it had urged Cityline to “handle [the situation] swiftly and properly, to ensure that the experience of ticket holders would not be affected.” In mid-February, the Consumer Council received complaints involving ticketing errors for the much-anticipated performance of K-pop girl group NJZ, formerly known as NewJeans, which left fans with the wrong dates on their passes.

The China Development Forum convenes after weeks that have seen Trump slap multiple rounds of tariffs on goods from the country, threatening a vital lifeline as economic challenges persist. Chinese leaders have been seeking to steer a shaky economy onto a more stable path since the end of the pandemic, particularly by boosting consumption. They are also now seeking to assert the country’s role as a staunch defender of the multilateral economic system, as Trump wages tariff wars with major US trading partners including China, Canada and Mexico. “China will firmly stand on the correct side of history, that of fairness and justice, and act in a righteous manner amid the rough waters of the times,” Premier Li Qiang said. Li’s speech came at the opening of the annual forum, attended this year by prominent business leaders including Apple CEO Tim Cook. The country will “adhere to the correct direction of economic globalisation, practice true multilateralism and strive to be a force for stability and certainty”, Li vowed. And in apparent reference to renewed trade wars sparked by Trump, he added: “today, global economic fragmentation is intensifying”, while “instability and uncertainty are on the rise”. Beijing has in recent weeks expressed an open attitude toward engaging with Trump for trade talks. US Senator Steve Daines on Saturday met with He Lifeng, China’s Vice Premier responsible for economic matters, during a visit to Beijing viewed as a bid to ease strained relations. Daines is also meeting with Li on Sunday for talks that are expected to involve the cross-border flow of fentanyl and the deadly drug’s precursor chemicals from China into the United States. Trump says his new tariffs on China are due to Beijing’s failure to stem shipments of the chemicals, which underpin a devastating drug crisis. Beijing has insisted that it cracks down harshly on the illicit production and trade of drugs, describing the issue as one for Washington itself to solve. During his meeting with Daines, He said China “firmly opposes the politicisation, weaponisation and instrumentalisation of economic and trade issues”. The Vice Premier added that China is willing to “engage in candid dialogue” with the United States to resolve issues. The two countries have “many common interests and broad space for cooperation”, he added. The tariffs imposed by Trump since taking office in January amount to a 20 percent blanket hike on Chinese overseas shipments to the United States. The country’s exports reached record heights last year, but observers warn that turbulence in the global trading system could force Beijing to find other ways to boost activity. Data released Monday indicated an uneven recovery during the first two months of the year. Retail sales charted a moderate increase from the previous January-February period, though unemployment rose to its highest level recorded in two years. Beijing says it is targeting growth this year of around five percent — the same as last year and a goal considered ambitious by many economists.

HKFP,news,‘My personal Four Trails’: Director Robin Lee on filming Hong Kong’s gruelling race and his own marathon creative process,https://hongkongfp.com/2025/03/23/four-trails-documentary/,"<figure><img alt="""" class=""attachment-rss-image-size size-rss-image-size wp-post-image"" height=""576"" src=""https://hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Robin-Lee-wants-us-to-conquer-our-own-Four-Trails-1024x576.jpg"" width=""1024"" /></figure>Hong Kong-born filmmaker Robin Lee never expected that Four Trails, his first feature-length production, would become a box-office success.

Four Trails – a documentary about runners who competed in the Hong Kong Four Trails Ultra Challenge, the city’s gruelling ultramarathon race – was originally supposed to have only a limited release. It was expected to only make between HK$100,000 to HK$300,000 at the box office. “Because it’s a documentary of a fairly niche sport, everyone was just thinking, It’s just going to be a small screening,” Lee told HKFP at his Stanley walk-up flat, sitting at a dining table, also used as an editing station. However, after the documentary was released last December, tickets for the first five screenings sold out. Film distributor Edko doubled the number of screenings, and tickets were also gone. Again and again. “Because everything just sold out for an entire month, Edko [was] like, ‘OK, I think, enough people know about this film now,’” the film director recalled. The movie later enjoyed a wide theatrical release in January. It was shown in Broadway cinemas citywide, with 75 screenings a day. As of early March, it had raked in more than HK$9 million in box office sales. There was an early sign of Four Trails’ success. It won the Audience Choice Award at the Hong Kong Asian Film Festival in 2023. But Lee said its success at the box office still took everyone by surprise. “If you go by the numbers, by the books, Edko wouldn’t underestimate anything, because a traditional documentary doesn’t do more than what it does,” he said. Four Trails was shot during the 2021 edition of the annual ultramarathon. The trail running challenge was founded by Hong Kong-based German expat Andre Blumberg in 2012, and covers Hong Kong’s four major hiking routes – MacLehose, Wilson, Hong Kong, and Lantau – spanning a total distance of 298km. Among the runners featured in the documentary are: Stone Tsang and Salomon Wettstein, the golden boys of the Four Trails ultramarathon gunning for below 50-hour finishing time; Sarah Pemberton, the youngest of the participants and the only one to be taking on the challenge for the fourth time; dark horse Jacky Leung; and Law Kai-pong, who suffered a major injury just weeks before the race. In the film, they become more than just runners, each telling their own story of approach and ambition in participating in the ultramarathon. Wettstein, a tech consultant, times his race down to the second with surgical precision, while Pemberton challenges herself to claim the coveted title of “finisher” by completing the race under the 60-hour mark. Leung and Law, meanwhile, participate for the last time before leaving Hong Kong with their families. Lee had more than 10 years of filmmaking experience under his belt when he made Four Trails. However, faced with 200 hours of raw footage at one point, as well as the self-doubt and unfamiliar terrain that came with working on one’s debut feature, he eventually came to see the film as something of a commentary on his own marathon filmmaking process. He recalled the emotional roller coaster after editing the scenes of Wettstein deciding to drop out of the race. “I remember the first time I edited that, I was like, OK, I really like this. But after the 50th time of watching it, I [did not] get goosebumps anymore. I’d think, ‘Is it not good?'” he said. “That happens for every single segment… and you’ve just got to remind yourself of your initial feeling – that’s what hopefully the audience is going to feel when they watch it.” Making the film “was my personal Four Trails,” said Lee, who spent most of his childhood and early adolescence in Hong Kong. “You have the same lows that the runners do, but then maybe you edit one segment together, and then all of a sudden, it’s amazing.” The self-funded passion project was the culmination of a decade of working as a freelance videographer abroad. An avid skier in his youth – “fairly decent but nowhere near [professional],” he quipped – Lee began filming himself on the slopes after realising going pro wasn’t an option. He first tried with a GoPro camera before eventually upgrading to a Canon 7D, a gift from his father. Following brief stints at CNN and Ogilvy fresh out of university, Lee worked for a Colorado-based production company focusing on ski films, shooting in Japan, Iceland, Russia, India, and across the US and Europe. Five years into the job, he got bored, and while resting back home in Hong Kong, he realised: “I wanted to take the stuff that I did overseas and bring it back to Hong Kong.” In 2017, Lee directed another documentary, Breaking 60, named after the much-coveted 60-hour time limit to finish the ultramarathon. The earlier film was shorter and rougher around the edges. Though Lee didn’t know it at the time, the 45-minute vignette would pave the way for his debut feature. “It goes back to Breaking 60 and supporting friends who have done the four trails,” he said. That was how he learned to deploy his dozen-strong team at key checkpoints, based on the runners’ GPS-tracked locations, some stationary, some mobile. He learned that Shek O was a key turning point, infamous for being where runners start dropping out of the race, and the Twins, along the Wilson trail, was considered one of the hardest hikes in the city. “Climbing up to the Buddha, that section is just horrible, so let’s make sure we get a camera here,” he recalled. Before the actual February 2021 race, Lee filmed the participants on their training runs, including Tsang who did the MacLehose and Wilson trails in a single session. More than capturing some footage, it also allowed him to get to know each of the runners and to scout for key filming spots along the trails. “You’re kind of building this database of areas that you would like to film for purely aesthetic reasons, then other locations where you know that you can interact with [the runners] so they can talk to you, give their feelings, so you can build out their stories.” But despite the meticulous planning that went into capturing every turn of each runner’s race, Four Trails was nothing short of a surprise. All eyes were on Tsang and Wettstein, the duo with an ambition to “break 50,” but no one expected Leung to finish the four trails in 49 hours and 21 minutes. “It was just like the film, just a complete shock that something like this is happening,” Lee said. Leung, then 37 years old, doesn’t even make his first appearance until the final third of the film, though not quite as a result of a conscious creative decision by the team. Because of the staggered start times, which had Leung kick off second to last, no one realised that he was actually close to leading the pack. And because he had joined late, filling a slot after internationals pulled out in the lead-up to the event, there was no interview footage of him on his training runs. At one point in the film, it is almost as if you realise before he does: Leung is on his way to break 50. Then the tape rewinds, bringing the audience back to the starting line, showing Leung, seemingly unremarkable, at the beginning of his 49-hour swan song. “No one knew about Jacky [Leung] until the Lantau Trail. The film portrays it exactly how we were feeling,” Lee said. “So I came up with the rewind, don’t really show Jacky in the first half because no one was really paying attention to him, and edit the film how it played out.” In a way, the process of filming Four Trails mirrored the unpredictability of the ultramarathon. No amount of planning could prepare the runners for what would come on the trail, or the film crew for Leung’s finish. Call it a lapse in judgement, a logistical constraint, or a lack of preparation, but Lee was just happy it turned out well. “I’m incredibly grateful that that happened,” he said. “In the trail running community, we always knew that it would be popular, but I always wanted to make it a film [that] people outside the community could enjoy. So that was a big goal when I was editing it and putting it together and filming it.” Throughout his interview, Leung makes offhanded mentions of the 2021 race being his “last,” without mentioning explicitly his plan to leave the city in a matter of months. Fast forward to the release of Four Trails in December, he was in his third year in Edinburgh. Lee, meanwhile, is in conversations with a distributor to bring the documentary overseas. It would be small, intimate screenings, with the simple aim of bringing the film to Hong Kong communities overseas. “But we really want to get it out there,” the director said. “People… have watched it in Hong Kong and asked us when’s the film going to go on platforms, not for them to watch it again but because they want to show people overseas that this is what Hong Kong has.” Leung would also mention how uplifting and motivational Four Trails turned out. It was a fitting counterpoint to the emotional catharsis of a recent wave of Hong Kong cinema. As the Hong Kong Film Critics Society put it, “local structures of feeling,” the natural scenery, and each runner’s personal narrative all made Four Trails a “timely boost of morale to a low-spirited Hong Kong.” The film even inspired a group of primary school students to hike the final stretch of the Lantau trail and make a pilgrimage to the green mailbox in Mui Wo, the finish line of the ultramarathon race. While hoping he would also get something out of that boost, the director said he was in no rush to take on another film project. “Four Trails took three years and it’s probably going to be even more out of my life, which I’m grateful for and I’m happy to do it, but it’s such a big commitment that I don’t want to jump into another project without having that same motivation,” Lee said. Making the documentary “was my own four trails,” he said again, adding, “and maybe there’s a lot of Hongkongers who’ve got their own four trails, whatever it may be.” Support HKFP  |  Policies & Ethics  |  Error/typo?  |  Contact Us  |  Newsletter  | Transparency & Annual Report | Apps Help safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team Original reporting on HKFP is backed by our monthly contributors.

But the birthday boy was absent from every event — he’s a virtual character in the romantic mobile game “Love and Deepspace” that has won over millions of young women in China and beyond. Launched last year, the game blends monster-hunting action with sometimes-raunchy cutscenes in a futuristic world where “love knows no bounds”, according to Shanghai-based developer Papergames. And players are hooked on its realistic 3D character modelling, immersive narratives and the chance to build relationships with five distinct virtual boyfriends. See also: ‘I’m not interested in 3D men’: In China, young women cast female cosplayers as dream dates Since its release in January 2024, the game has earned more than $500 million worldwide on the Google Play store and Apple’s App Store. About 40 percent of its revenue comes from overseas, market research firm Sensor Tower told AFP. For many, these virtual companions offer more than entertainment — they provide emotional fulfilment. Liu Xue, a 25-year-old office worker, likens her connection with Rafayel to a real-life romantic relationship. “To myself, or to my inner circle of close friends, I would say that we are lovers,” she told AFP at a birthday event in Beijing. “I don’t think I need company in real life.” He accompanies Liu daily, comforts her when she’s down — and even keeps her up-to-date on her menstrual cycle. “It’s like emotional sustenance,” she said. This attachment, however, comes with a price tag. While “Love and Deepspace” is free to download, players often spend heavily on in-game purchases to unlock additional storylines and interactions with their favourite characters. The game does not offer women partners, though there are similar games that do — but few with the same reach and popularity. Third-party surveys suggest that about five to 10 percent of those playing “Love and Deepspace” are male. Wang Yaya, a 23-year-old university student, has spent over 70,000 yuan (US$10,000) on the game and related merchandise. “I’m happy to pay for the emotional value,” she told AFP. Fans pool their money to organise events — such as those to celebrate Rafayel’s birthday — where they pose for photos with cardboard cutouts of the heartthrob and exchange homemade merchandise. A seven-year veteran of games like “Love and Deepspace”, Wang attributes the willingness of her and her peers to spend to a lack of emotional support from their parents as children. “Many of my friends are the same,” she explained. And for some players, the virtual romances are much more enticing than real-life dating. Since discovering games like “Love and Deepspace”, Liu said she has lost interest in dating real men. “Playing otome games is an especially nice experience and even better than real life,” she said, referring to the wider genre of romantic games, originally developed in Japan. Student Liu Yuxuan, 22, sees her bond with Rafayel as a central part of her life. “Because everyone can have their secrets, some of which you cannot tell others. When you open the game, you can talk to him,” she said. “I can reveal myself to him without reservation, and he will show me his love without reservation,” she said. Rafayel’s love is firm and faithful — something she says is rare in real life. Another player, who goes by Zaylia, summed up the game’s appeal for her peers: “It fulfils our fantasy of being in a relationship.” “Isn’t the greatest use of a relationship itself to provide emotional value?” Beijing, China Produced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic standards.

Trump strongly denied media reports that the world’s richest man, who is now leading the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), would receive a classified Pentagon briefing on its war strategy. Tesla and Space X boss Musk has major business interests in China but also has huge US defense contracts, while his status as an unelected advisor to Trump has raised concerns about his influence. “I don’t want to show it to anybody. You’re talking about a potential war with China,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “Certainly you wouldn’t show it to a businessman who is helping us so much… Elon has businesses in China and he would be susceptible perhaps to that.” Trump, who was unveiling a contract for Boeing to build the next-generation F-47 fighter jet, described Musk as a “patriot” and hailed his efforts to slash back the US federal government, including the Defense Department. Musk was at the Pentagon on Friday, but Trump attacked reports, first published in the New York Times, about the visit. “They really are the enemy of the people,” Trump said of the Times, which reported Musk was to receive a briefing in a secure room dubbed “The Tank” on maritime tactics and targeting plans. The paper said the briefing was called off after it was publicized. The United States increasingly sees China as its biggest rival and tensions have soared since Trump’s inauguration as the world’s two largest economies hit each other with tariffs. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth hailed the “amazing visit” by Musk to the Pentagon. “I look forward to continuing our work together,” Hegseth said on X. Musk joined the chorus of criticism of the Times, labeling it “pure propaganda” on his social media platform X. “I’ve been to the Pentagon many times over many years. Not my first time in the building,” he wrote. Musk has long-standing business ties to China, however. His automaker Tesla produces some of its electric vehicles at a huge so-called gigafactory in Shanghai and is trying to compete with fast-growing Chinese manufacturers. See also: Elon Musk leaves Beijing after Tesla wins key data security clearance from China The entrepreneur has become a cult figure in China and has fostered ties with its leadership. He has also suggested the self-ruled island of Taiwan should become part of China. In the United States, Trump has repeatedly insisted that Musk has no conflicts of interest, even as Musk leads a harsh overhaul of US government agencies that in some cases his companies have dealings with. Musk’s SpaceX has US government defense contracts worth billions of dollars, including for launching rockets and for the use of the Starlink satellite service. Trump has recently further blurred the line by promoting Tesla cars after attacks by vandals over Musk’s links to the White House. Trump suggested Friday that such vandals could be deported to prisons in El Salvador.

High-rises across Hong Kong are often seen encased in bamboo poles, strapped together with nylon fasteners. Skilled scaffolders – nicknamed “spiders” – lash the poles together, creating platforms. But such sights may become less common, with the government looking to phase out the centuries-old technique and replace the material with metal frames. Lightweight bamboo has been favoured for its speed of construction and availability, and has a greater tensile strength than steel. On Monday, however, the Development Bureau said it planned to “drive a wider adoption of metal scaffolds in public building works progressively” to improve safety, citing bamboo’s combustibility and tendency to deteriorate over time. There have been 23 deaths since 2018 involving bamboo scaffolds, according to AFP, citing official figures – mostly involving falls from height, fires or collapses. Comparable data for metal scaffolds was not immediately available. The industry has also faced a shortage of labour and materials in recent years. In January, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Bamboo Scaffolding Workers Union said they opposed the retirement of bamboo. According to RTHK, they said accidents were usually a result of poor site safety management, not the scaffolding. The union’s Ho Ping-tak said that 80 per cent of sites still use bamboo and some 4,000 specialist workers could be affected if it were banned.

Since their emergence from the depths of Hong Kong’s industrial spaces in 2006, the four-piece band has maintained a memorable presence by performing in live houses and throwing guerrilla gigs. It has never been a household name, but to the city’s indie community, the 19-year-old band is a long-lived legend. With the release of a new album last month, An Id Signal wants to reach more people in Hong Kong, especially in the lingering aftermath of the 2019 protests and the Covid-19 pandemic – a double whammy that has profoundly changed the underground music scene over the past half-decade. Their long-awaited album, The Path Where Grief and Joy Intersect – released 13 years after their last – is a poignant reflection of Hong Kong’s collective experience while holding fast to the band’s aesthetic style. “We have been making music with a rather personal style,” said Leung Wing-lai, the band’s frontman and lyricist. “But now our focus has changed, and we need to connect to more people.” Despite intentional ambiguity in the lyrics, symbols that reference the pro-democracy protests and unrest in 2019 – and the fallout – can be heard in the eight-track album. Some new songs also appear to be conversational, touching on issues such as farewells and reunions, as opposed to the band’s earlier hits that were more about one’s inner self. “I think it’s what has happened in our time that makes us more outward-looking. Even in the underground scene, you know that it has been changed,” Leung told HKFP in Cantonese. During the pandemic, the city’s underground music venues had to grapple with stringent social-distancing measures. Legendary live house This Town Needs – which survived rent hikes and government crackdowns – shut down in 2020. But new faces emerged – both on and off the stage – whenever policies allowed for live music to happen. “The pandemic had been a critical change to the indie scene. You saw a lot of bands scattered around the city, performing deep underground,” Leung said. “Also, you met a lot of new people, who earnestly wanted to listen to music.” However, the band also feels that free expression in the city has been curtailed in recent years. “Especially after 2019, my personal feeling is that fewer and fewer things can be said in this place,” said drummer Kitt Lau. This has created a sense of urgency for underground artists like themselves. “For us, perhaps, it’s about going back to our roots, which is to speak through music,” Lau said. The making of An Id Signal’s third full-length album spanned the entire pandemic. The songs were first conceived by guitarist Chan Ho-nam. Leung wrote the lyrics in Cantonese and then sang them in a vocal teetering between screams and murmurs. They said most songs on the album also featured ideas from the band’s ex-members and earlier writings. Some songs evolved in jam sessions or in live performances over the years. “To me, the songs have always been there, but they have not yet been completed,” guitarist Chan said. “When the right moment comes, we will know,” Lau, the drummer, added. However, there is at least one song, “a flash of longing,” that has a clear origin. Leung wrote it on July 1, 2020, when thousands of Hongkongers rallied against a national security law imposed by Beijing, following the protests and unrest the previous year. Over 10,000 people were arrested in relation to the 2019 protests. Following the 2020 imposition of the national security law, scores of the city’s prominent pro-democracy activists and politicians were prosecuted. In another song, which bears the same title as the album, the lyric goes: “Summer nights run straight into winter” – an apparent reference to a widely shared slogan painted on a wall by a protester in 2019. “Frankly, I was thinking of the people on the street in 2019,” Leung said of writing the song. The months-long protests and unrest faded as Covid-19 hit the city in early 2020. The July 1 rally that year was one of the last large-scale displays of dissent seen in Hong Kong. Leung said the political events five years ago have influenced his writing, as he now looks beyond his personal feelings for inspiration. “As time passes and things happen, our experiences have turned into deeper feelings for this place, and for the people around us,” he said. “If it was 12, 13 years ago, I would not have known how to write these songs… So this is the right timing. Not earlier, not later.” When the band performed some of the new songs during the pandemic, it was a far cry from what the band was used to in the past. In the 2010s, An Id Signal would perform in live music venues buried in Hong Kong’s industrial buildings. They also threw spontaneous guerrilla gigs in public areas, inviting people through word of mouth and text messages. Still, a crowd of diehard fans would show up. But it was virtually impossible to play shows in such settings during the pandemic due to social distancing measures. The only possible venues for indie music were mid-sized halls that were large enough to accommodate people without breaking anti-pandemic rules. Shows were also only allowed sparingly between outbreaks. It was to their surprise that the first show An Id Signal played during the pandemic, in 2022, had drawn old and new audiences alike. “There were new faces and old friends… in a brand new venue that we would have never performed in in the past,” Lau said. “It felt familiar but strange.” Realising that the underground scene may have changed forever, the band embraced bigger stages and seized any opportunities to perform. “Practically speaking, the physical space [for underground music] has shrunk, so we have to go whenever opportunities arise,” bassist Ying Ka-lok said. But they said they were not turning away from their roots. “We have never left [the underground],” said Leung. “We are now facing a larger audience in the hope that our music will have greater resonance. This is important to us.” “It is the resonance that matters, and it has nothing to do with where we play our music,” Chan added. Last December, An Id Signal headlined the indie stage of Clockenflap – Hong Kong’s largest music festival – for the first time. Clockenflap was held in Central Harbourfront, with the indie stage in Tamar Park. They said it was not without a sense of sarcasm for the band to play on a stage right under the shadow of the government headquarters – a building nicknamed by the authorities “door always open.” “We were the little people underneath it,” Leung quipped. The album’s debut performance on April 3 will see An Id Signal return to a more familiar setting, in San Po Kong’s Portal, right next to the band’s first album launch party in 2006. They wish to see their childhood peers – three of them were born in the 1980s – and to meet new friends. “It’s been a while, we hope to see you that night,” the band wrote on Instagram. See also: ‘Tomorrow never knows’: Hong Kong indie collective seeks community, history for the city’s alternative music scene Two decades on, Leung said it is invaluable that the band is still passionate and creative in making music. What’s more, he said, is that An Id Signal has been part of the underground music ecology that continues to evolve. Yet, with all the changes in recent years, An Id Signal could also become a living testament to the history of Hong Kong’s underground music. “There are a lot of new fans who do not know what it was like before [the pandemic and the 2019 protests],” Lau said. “You need a band that has been around long enough… to be able to bring out the past.” English translation of An Id Signal’s lyrics is courtesy of Hong Kong poet Tim Tim Cheng.

Instead, it is part of a defiant art show challenging Hong Kong’s stuffy power structures, held in an office tower at the heart of a finance district famous for its long hours and cut-throat competition. The group exhibition — named “RE:URGENT” in mockery of corporate-speak — is meant to “subvert the office space that we are working in every day”, said curator Renee Lui, managing director of Young Soy Gallery. The exhibition mirrors a workspace, with four artists given a standard office cubicle to present their work in, and one displaying in the boss’ office. “This is sort of a really rigid space that people (wouldn’t normally) see as being able to contain creative ideas,” Lui told AFP. The main office is occupied by artist Dominic Johnson-Hill, whose idiosyncratic desktop was inspired by his 28 years doing business in Beijing. “I went to a lot of bosses’ offices,” he said. “I really wanted to sort of copy a lot of that paraphernalia.” His displayed pieces include a surreal digital wall clock, which tells time in an eerie, robotic voice. Next to its numbers is a picture of people looking down at their phones whilst queuing to enter a coffin store. Johnson-Hill came across such traditional shops in a Hong Kong neighbourhood and was inspired to create the piece, which he said poked fun at aimless work culture. “I thought how wonderful it would be to see people dressed in office attire queuing… (it’s) a ridiculous idea that was quite playful,” he said. In another cubicle, artist Riya Chandiramani sits role-playing as an “unpaid intern” who dreams of starting a feminist revolution. In a painting, she imagines herself as the Hindu goddess Kali, forced into a treacherous game of snakes and ladders set in the workplace. “The numbers also represent ages, and so there is also that aspect of women not being allowed to age,” Chandiramani said. The show is taking place during Hong Kong’s “Art Month”, headlined by art fairs which draw wealthy buyers from around the world. But gallery co-founder Shivang Jhunjhnuwala said he decided to ditch the fairs after two years because of high exhibition costs and “a lack of confidence in the art market”. The show is pushing against the mainstream in its thematic matter too. In one corner, almost unnoticed, is a palm-sized paper cutout of Chinese President Xi Jinping, trapped within multiple frames, by pseudonymous artist Louie Jaubere. “The people are not in control of what the state dictates,” the artist said. “But it is not targeted at China; it generally represents government or state control.” See also: Hong Kong museum puts Picasso in cross-cultural dialogue Hong Kong’s freedom of expression and political rights have been whittled away since Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law in 2020 after large and sometimes violent protests the year before. At the show’s opening, retired architect Serena Chan said she appreciated the show’s sense of humour. “The other rebels are all gone,” she said. “Rebels in art are probably still allowed, so let’s have more of that.” Hong Kong, China Produced externally by an organization we trust to adhere to high journalistic standards.

Beijing claims democratic Taiwan as part of its territory and has threatened to use force to bring the self-ruled island under control. It regularly deploys fighter jets and warships around the island and has held several major military exercises since President Lai Ching-te took office in Taipei last year. Lai announced the pay rises while visiting a military camp in the capital on Friday and vowed to “continue to take care of the hard-working officers and soldiers from all aspects”. From April 1, volunteer enlistees will get an additional monthly allowance of up to NT$5,000 (US$151) on top of the current NT$10,000, while the allowance for members of combat forces will more than double to up to NT$12,000 a month. “Let us protect the country together and ensure our daily life of freedom and democracy,” Lai told military officials and Marines at the camp. Raising salaries and benefits was not only a short-term measure to solve “manpower decline” but also a long-term “talent investment to bring stable talent and improve efficiency”, the defence ministry said in a statement. The aim was to “stabilise defence capabilities… and encourage volunteer service members to stay for a long time, while attracting young people to join the military”, it said. The pay rises followed recent media reports that the number of soldiers who opted out of their contracts early had almost quadrupled in recent years. See also: Taiwan’s Lai Ching-te says defence of island’s sovereignty ‘will not change’ Last year, 1,565 voluntary military personnel left the service early and paid a financial penalty, compared with 401 in 2020. The number of serving volunteer military personnel stood at 152,885 in June 2024, the lowest since 2018, according to the defence ministry. Lai also urged opposition parties to show “the greatest support” to the military and rethink the impact of freezing and cutting the island’s defence budget. Taiwan’s government was planning to increase defence spending to a record NT$647 billion in 2025, or around 2.5 percent of GDP. However, some items were cut or frozen by the opposition-controlled parliament, including a 50 percent freeze on spending for a submarine programme and drone industry park.

Lau Ka-ping appeared at the High Court on Thursday to hear his verdict after a trial that lasted over 20 days. The seven-member jury returned a unanimous guilty verdict after deliberating for less than three hours. The 42-year-old was accused of wilfully assaulting his daughter between May and July 18, 2020, and murdering her on July 29, 2020, the date she passed away at Princess Margaret Hospital after being sent there for treatment. He earlier pleaded guilty to the wilful assault charge. Testifying for the prosecution during the trial, the girl’s mother, Helen Leung, said Lau was harsh towards their daughter, disciplining her if she failed to read or sing English songs, according to court news outlet The Witness. He had on more than one occasion taken their daughter by the shoulder and shaken her for around 10 seconds, Leung said. The court also heard that Lau had been convicted 10 times, including for a wounding offence, in which he had poured corrosive liquid on Leung during a fight two weeks after their daughter was born. Lau was handed a 20-month jail sentence for the offence. The defendant personally testified in the murder trial. He said that on July 18, 2020, he heard his daughter crying and was angered because he had just fallen asleep. He said he asked his daughter loudly, “Why are you crying?” and used his hands to shake his daughter’s shoulders. Lau said while he was in the bathroom, he heard a sound, and when he came out, he saw his daughter had fallen on the floor. He said he then called the paramedics, and his daughter was brought to a hospital. During the trial, the prosecution read out the testimonies and medical reports from two doctors who treated Lau’s daughter when she was hospitalised. The neurosurgeon and ophthalmologist said they found sounds of bleeding beneath the girl’s skull and in her retinas, similar to shaken baby syndrome, a serious brain injury that occurs when an infant or toddler is shaken forcefully. A coroner who was summoned by the prosecution said the girl’s cause of death was a head injury involving brain tissue that had necrotised. The coroner said this appeared to be related to violent shaking, and that the injury seemed to have happened two weeks before her death. The girl died on her third birthday, the court heard. See also: More than 1,200 criminal cases of domestic abuse handled by Hong Kong police in 2023, highest since 2019 Lau admitted during the trial that he had punished his daughter before, including by shaking her by the shoulders. He said he did so because he wanted the best for her, and was afraid his daughter would “follow in [his] footsteps” and “learn bad habits” like he did. The court also heard that Lau had earlier pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter, but this was not accepted by the prosecution. The case was adjourned to next Wednesday for mitigation, after which Judge Anna Lai would hand down Lau’s mandatory life sentence for murder.

Under a three-tier system approved by the Housing Authority on Friday, public housing tenants earning above the income limit will have to pay up to 4.5 times the basic rent, Cleresa Wong, chair of the authority’s Subsidised Housing Committee, told reporters. Those required to pay rent at the highest level will also be ordered to leave after four years. They will still be eligible to apply to purchase a subsidised flat, but will have to leave their rental apartments by 2029. The new rates, which will apply to the new income declaration cycle this October, are part of a broader push to crack down on the abuse of limited public housing resources in land-scarce Hong Kong, including by “well-off tenants.” Tenants will start paying the new rates next October. See also: Hong Kong to hand out cash rewards for exposing public housing abuses The policy will introduce revisions to the existing system, which currently dictates that tenants earning more than two times the income limit have to pay 1.5 times the nominal rent, while those earning between three and five times the limit will have their rents doubled from the basic level. Meanwhile, tenants earning five times the income limit are required to return their flats to the government. The Housing Authority has proposed imposing income limits of HK$25,100 for a family of three and HK$31,000 for a family of four for the coming year. Under the new arrangement, tenants earning between two and three times the income limit will have to pay 2.5 times the basic rent, and those earning between three and four times the limit will pay 3.5 times the basic level. Some 1,200 tenants making above four times the income limit will be required to pay 4.5 times the basic rent, more than double what they are paying now. Those tenants will also be required to leave their flats after four years, under the new policy. However, they will also retain the eligibility to apply for a subsidised flat for four years following their evictions with “green form” status, which allows current or former public housing tenants to purchase a subsidised flat, local media reported on Thursday. Local media quoted sources as saying that the move to reallocate public housing resources would help those in need while encouraging those better off to seek upward mobility. Public rental flats with cheap subsidised rents are home to about 800,000 Hong Kong households. The Housing Authority, Hong Kong’s main provider of public housing, said in January that it would offer rewards of up to HK$3,000 for exposing abuses of public housing. A new amendment has also introduced a HK$500,000 fine and one year in jail for public housing abuse. Since mid-2022, the government has taken back some 7,000 flats as it steps up efforts to check the value of tenants’ vehicles and whether they own property elsewhere, calling it a necessary initiative because of the limited public housing supply. Tenancy abuse cases also include subletting, engaging in illegal activities such as gambling or drug possession, commercial activities, and making false declarations relating to income, assets, marital status, or household particulars.

Lo was among 135 people arrested outside the Chinachem Golden Plaza in Tsim Sha Tsui on November 18, 2019, when they were on their way to the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). The red-brick campus in Hung Hom was besieged by the police as it turned into one of the most brutal battlefields between pro-democracy demonstrators and the force. The then-district councillor was said to have stayed in the area for at least 40 minutes, while protesters at the scene held umbrellas in their hands and chanted slogans. Lin ruled in November 2022 that it was “morally suspicious” for Lo to remain at the scene for personal benefit. The judge ruled that Lo tried to portray an image that he was “on the same side” as protesters in order to “raise his profile and accumulate political capital.” Nonetheless, there was no evidence to prove Lo’s intent and motive, and thus it could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt that Lo had taken part in the unlawful assembly, the trial judge concluded. During an appeal hearing last November, government counsels questioned whether Lin acquitted Lo because he did not give “sufficient consideration” to the case facts. They said Lo stood in the front row of the crowd and chose to stay behind despite knowing that the protesters were resisting the police. His presence provided support and encouragement to the demonstrators, the government lawyers said. They also argued that Lin did not refer to the correct legal precedents and erred when he took into account Lo’s “extraneous” intent. Lo’s lawyer defended the trial judge’s ruling and said that although the party chairman had “brought suspicion onto himself,” his attire and lack of interaction with the protesters showed that participation in the unlawful assembly was “not the only inference to be drawn from this case.” In a written judgment handed down on Friday, Justices Derek Pang, Maggie Poon, and Anthea Pang agreed with the government representatives that Lin did not “truly grasp” the details of the relevant precedents. It was “regrettable” that Lin overlooked the most recent and authoritative case at the time of the trial, the justices said. The trial judge also failed to “read through clearly” the other previous precedents. But the appeal panel ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove Lo had any intent that was required to bring charges against him. “The acquittal of Lo was not due to a misunderstanding of the law by the original trial judge,” the justices wrote in Chinese. They also sided with the conclusion of Lin that it was possible that Lo, as a politician, had tried to “raise his political capital by manipulating the perception of the crowd.” It was also a fact that Lo did not have any regular protest gear and did not confront the police directly, the court said. “The conclusion of the original trial judge, while not necessarily the conclusion of other fact-finders, is by no means irrational,” the judgment read. Protests erupted in June 2019 over a since-axed extradition bill. They escalated into sometimes violent displays of dissent against police behaviour, amid calls for democracy and anger over Beijing’s encroachment. Demonstrators demanded an independent probe into police conduct, amnesty for those arrested and a halt to the characterisation of protests as “riots.” The PolyU was surrounded on all sides by riot police for almost two weeks, as some protesters were holed up inside the red-brick campus, while others “surrendered” themselves to the authorities. Some took desperate measures to flee the university by climbing down ropes or escaping through underground sewers. The siege left more than 300 people hospitalised and over 1,300 arrested.

The study was released on Thursday to coincide with the UN’s International Day of Happiness. The city dropped from 86th last year to 88th, sitting between Albania and Armenia. China ranked 68th, Taiwan 27th and Singapore 34th. Macau was not surveyed. Finland, Denmark and Iceland occupied the top spots, whilst residents of Congo, Iran and Côte d’Ivoire were found to be the most unhappy. The World Happiness Report is a partnership between its editorial board and pollster Gallup, the Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre, and the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network. Based on a Gallup World Poll, the survey asked around 1,000 people in each country to evaluate their current life as a whole using the image of a ladder, with the best possible life ranked as a 10 and the worst possible as zero. It used weights to construct population-representative national averages, with the final rankings based on the average of three years of samples. Over 100,000 people in 140 countries and territories participated. The report also cross-referenced the results along the lines of six key variables: GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and freedom from corruption. See also: ‘Happy Hong Kong’ campaign to kick off with HK$30 movie tickets and food fair “Taken together, these six variables explain more than three-quarters of the variation in national life evaluation scores across countries and years, using data from 2005 onwards,” the report said.

Most applications under the Hong Kong Permanent Residence Pathway will be processed after 2027, according to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). It said the backlog was due to a “high volume of applications and limited admission spaces.” “As of October 31, 2024, 80% of permanent residence applications were processed within 12 months,” the IRCC website stated on Tuesday. “However, as Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada has received a higher volume of applications, a backlog is being created and the processing times for clients for the two pathways to permanent residence will increase with most of them expected to be processed after 2027.” As of last year, Canada had received over 26,500 applications and approved 10,500. Fewer than 200 were refused, according to IRCC statistics. Canada first introduced its “lifeboat” immigration scheme in February 2021, months after Beijing unilaterally passed national security legislation in Hong Kong. On its website, the IRCC described the security legislation as “undermining rights and freedoms” and said it may lead to “discriminatory or arbitrary interpretation and enforcement.” The immigration policy recognises “the contributions made by Hong Kong residents to Canada’s economy and social-cultural landscape through human capital, while also promoting democratic values,” the IRCC added. The scheme provides two additional ways for Hongkongers to gain permanent residence: Stream A, for those who have graduated from a post-secondary institution in Canada in the three years prior to their application, and Stream B, which requires the applicants to have had a year of work experience in Canada. The pathway scheme has no cap on applications but expires on August 31, 2026. In August 2023, Canada removed a post-secondary education requirement for Hongkongers applying for permanent residency through Stream B. A separate programme for Hong Kong graduates to apply for work permits ended last month. Beijing inserted national security legislation directly into Hong Kong’s mini-constitution in June 2020 following a year of pro-democracy protests and unrest. It criminalised subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces and terrorist acts – broadly defined to include disruption to transport and other infrastructure. The move gave police sweeping new powers and led to hundreds of arrests amid new legal precedents, while dozens of civil society groups disappeared. The authorities say it restored stability and peace to the city, rejecting criticism from trade partners, the UN and NGOs.

CK Hutchison offloaded its global ports business outside China — including operations in the vital Central American canal — this month to a group led by giant asset manager BlackRock for US$19 billion in cash. The parties expect to sign a “definitive agreement” by April 2 concerning the Panama Ports Company, which has operated two of the five ports at the canal since 1997 via a government concession. The deal came after weeks of pressure from US President Donald Trump, who refused to rule out a military invasion of Panama to “take back” the crucial waterway from alleged Chinese control. Thursday’s results announcement made no mention of the BlackRock deal. “On the whole, the Group’s underlying operating results were relatively stable” last year despite a one-time loss related to its Vietnam telecommunications business, chairman Victor Li, son of billionaire founder Li Ka-shing, said in a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Li said the operating environment for CK Hutchison businesses is “expected to be both volatile and unpredictable” this year, and that the group will “constrain capital spending and new investment and focus on stringent cash flow management”. The conglomerate said its “ports and related services” division saw an 11 percent jump in revenue to $5.8 billion. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation soared 19 percent year-on-year to US$2.1 billion, the firm said. “There may be headwinds with supply chain disruptions anticipated in the early part of the year due to shipping lines transitioning into their new alliances, as well as ongoing geopolitical risk impacting global trade,” Li said as part of the ports division’s 2025 outlook. Shares in CK Hutchison jumped more than 20 percent in Hong Kong after the ports deal was first announced on March 4. However, Beijing made its displeasure known last week through two government offices overseeing Hong Kong affairs that republished newspaper articles criticising the deal as “spineless” and “betraying and selling out all Chinese people”. Hong Kong leader John Lee also said on Tuesday that concerns about the sale “deserve serious attention”, adding that the city will “handle it in accordance with the law and regulations”. CK Hutchison cancelled its post-earnings news conference on Thursday and has not responded to AFP enquiries. Bloomberg News, citing unidentified sources, has reported that senior Chinese leaders have ordered government agencies, including the State Administration for Market Regulation, to scrutinise the deal. The conglomerate is registered in the Cayman Islands and the assets being sold are all outside China. Following years of diversification, operations in mainland China and Hong Kong made up just 12 percent of CK Hutchison revenue last year, according to Thursday’s results. Net income last year stood at US$2.20 billion after the group recognised a one-time loss of US$476 million related to its Vietnam telecommunication business “as the operating conditions continue to be under significant pressure”. CK Hutchison announced a full-year dividend of HK$2.20 per share on Thursday. The conglomerate had claimed to have “the world’s leading port network”, spanning 53 ports in 24 countries. However, in revenue terms, CK Hutchison’s ports division pales in comparison to its worldwide business interests in finance, retail, infrastructure and telecoms. Sister company CK Asset — the property developer arm in Li’s empire — said in a separate filing on Thursday that profit attributable to shareholders fell 20 percent last year. In Hong Kong, CK Hutchison is known for its founder, Li Ka-shing, the city’s wealthiest man nicknamed “Superman” for his business savvy. The 96-year-old enjoyed close ties with three generations of Chinese leaders but that bonhomie faded after Xi Jinping took power. Chinese state media has criticised Li over the past decade for his apparent decision to divest from some Chinese markets and for supposedly showing sympathy to Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters in 2019.

The current taxi industry lacked variety in service options and failed to meet the diverse needs of the market in terms of comfort and passenger capacity, lawmaker Simon Lee said in a 44-page research report on the regulation of ride-hailing platforms in the city, launched Thursday. The legislator said the demand for hire cars in Hong Kong had increased over the years due to “population and environmental changes,” but the market supply was insufficient, especially during rush hours. Coupled with the public’s disaffection with taxi services, the “only solution” was to issue more hire car permits and licenses for ride-hailing platforms, Lee said. “Drivers should undergo assessments similar to taxi licensing exams and complete background checks to prevent individuals with serious criminal records from entering the industry, ensuring passenger safety,” the report also read. Lee added that hire cars should also install dashcams, GPS systems, and cameras to ensure the safety of passengers and monitor the driver’s behaviour. The government announced in December that it planned to require all cabbies to install in-car surveillance cameras, GPS, dashcams, and electronic payment systems over the next two years in a bid to raise the service quality and image of the taxi sector. Hong Kong is seeking to regulate online ride-hailing platforms such as Uber by rolling out a licencing system. A proposal outlining the regulatory details is expected later this year. The embattled cab industry has railed against ride-hailing services, saying the largely unregulated platform posed unfair competition to taxi drivers. Last month, a taxi union threatened to stage a city-wide strike if the authorities failed to commit to a crackdown. But the plan was cancelled after Chief Executive John Lee warned that “drastic action” would not gain public support. Hong Kong currently caps the total number of permits for private hire car services at 1,500. As of December 31, 2021, a total of 1,115 licenses had been issued. The government said in May 2022 that the limit was imposed to “avoid affecting the operation of public transport services and aggravating road congestion.” Police told HKFP last month that the “enforcement figure” on the illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward by motor vehicles rose to 47 in 2024, from 33 in 2023. The force did not explain whether the figure represented the number of vehicles or drivers intercepted. It was also unclear whether any individual was arrested or prosecuted.
