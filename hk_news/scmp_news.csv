After Massive Sovereign won last year’s Derby, having begun his career under Aidan O’Brien in Ireland, Cap Ferrat pulled off a superb upset at Sha Tin on Sunday following 13 starts for Chris Waller in Australia. “It’s absolutely massive for us. It’s a big deal,” Mick Flanagan, Coolmore’s head of international sales, told the Post. “To be able to go to Sha Tin [on Sunday] having sold last year’s Derby winner and to see the owners celebrating, it’s just unbelievable. “We sold 10 horses to Hong Kong last year, which is a lot, and we’d like to do the same again this year, if not more. We’re open for business.” 👏 @CoolmoreAus @coolmorestud 👏

Coolmore predominantly is a stallion farm and the main driver of the business is stallion revenue. “There’s a big farming business behind it, a lot of land and a lot of families employed. We’re still a commercial operation, so we have to sell anything that isn’t going to make it as a stallion.” HISTORY AT SHA TIN! 👏👏@CWilliamsJockey wins the 148th @BMW Hong Kong Derby aboard Cap Ferrat for trainer Francis Lui over a fast-closing My Wish... #4YOSeries | #LoveRacing | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/OHHfz0JKlE Flanagan confirmed interest in Coolmore three-year-olds who could target the 2026 Hong Kong Derby as four-year-olds would ramp up around June. “I think the picture is clearer post Royal Ascot. We start to decipher what will make the stallion barn and what we maybe need to move onto different jurisdictions,” he said. “Hong Kong is a great market for both the northern and southern hemisphere, but in the northern hemisphere we have Saudi [Arabia], Bahrain, Dubai and the [United] States as well, so when our horses come up for sale it’s pretty hot competition. “We’re lucky as salesmen that we have a good product to sell – they’re the best bred, they’re the best looking and they’re very sound.” A year after Massive Sovereign took a massive 25-point hit for his Derby success, Cap Ferrat has been slugged a sizeable 19 points for his triumph in the Classic Series finale. While Massive Sovereign was lifted to a rating of 107 following his Derby win, Cap Ferrat now sits on a mark of 102 – the same as Romantic Warrior after his triumph in the race and one point less than Voyage Bubble. Runner-up My Wish moved to a rating of 101 after receiving a four-point hike for his effort. Cap Ferrat’s victory was witnessed by a record Derby Day crowd of 61,681 at Sha Tin, with an unprecedented 8,567 of those on course travelling from the mainland to witness Hong Kong’s most prestigious race. Those numbers came just days after the Jockey Club formalised a partnership with China Travel Service Hong Kong (CTS), something chief executive Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges labelled “very significant”. A continuation of the club’s efforts to promote tourism in the Greater Bay Area, the memorandum of understanding it signed with CTS will “jointly promote horse racing tourism by including Happy Valley, Sha Tin and Conghua racecourses into CTS travel itineraries”."

Sent off a warm $2.9 favourite for Sunday’s feature, Rubylot travelled one off the rail just forward of midfield before hitting the line solidly enough for fifth under Brenton Avdulla, a length and three-quarters behind the victorious Cap Ferrat. “It was an OK run,” said Hayes. “He had Noisy Boy lay on him the whole way. He bumped into him several times and he just didn’t get into his normal, relaxed rhythm. “Avdulla surprised me by saying that he thought if he didn’t get that he would have gone very close.” HISTORY AT SHA TIN! 👏👏@CWilliamsJockey wins the 148th @BMW Hong Kong Derby aboard Cap Ferrat for trainer Francis Lui over a fast-closing My Wish... #4YOSeries | #LoveRacing | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/OHHfz0JKlE Rubylot holds entries for the Champions Mile and the Group One QE II Cup (2,000m) on April 27’s Champions Day, with Hayes mulling his options for his Classic Cup (1,800m) victor. Nine-time Group One winner Mr Brightside, who is expected to fly to Hong Kong on April 14, and leading local miler Voyage Bubble will await Rubylot should Hayes opt to run him at 1,600m. “I think we’ll head towards Champions Day. I’ll just see how he is in the next week. I’ll study what the races are going to come up like – whether I go the mile or the 2,000m is up in the air,” said Hayes, who is itching to see Mr Brightside finally make it to Hong Kong after a couple of false starts. “Mr Brightside is booked and it’ll be great to have him up here. It looks a nice race for him.” Hayes looks to have a mortgage on the third Champions Day feature, the Group One Chairman’s Sprint Prize (1,200m), with gun sprinter Ka Ying Rising. Perfect tune-up for Ka Ying Rising! 😏

While Purton will miss Wednesday night’s all-dirt fixture at Sha Tin, Hayes will saddle up seven runners and he likes the chances of Solid Shalaa, who races for the first time since April last year in the Class Four Kestrel Handicap (1,200m). “I think Solid Shalaa should go pretty close first up. He looks ready to win,” said Hayes. “He’s been off the scene a long time but he seems to have come back very well. “He hurt his leg coming back from a tendon tear, but he’s trialled very well.”"

After being lumped with the outside gate of 14, Newnham and Ferraris hatched a plan to take second favourite My Wish – who has done most of his racing on or near the speed – back to last. In a race run at a crawl from the 1,600m to the 800m before they rattled home, Ferraris unleashed My Wish in the home straight but the Classic Mile winner fell just short of winner Cap Ferrat despite steaming home with a final 400m of 21.39 seconds. “Very brave. He’s been the best four-year-old through the series,” said Newnham after My Wish added a Derby second to his runner-up finish in the Classic Cup (1,800m) earlier this month.

We came up with a plan of where to ride him and how to ride him. All that went to script except we got beaten a short head. “We needed to do something from gate 14. It was no good going out there just hoping to get a spot. I thought our best chance was just to get him to relax, conserve energy and use his sprint. “He did all those things and Luke did all the right things, we just didn’t quite win. “The winner – gate two, third on the fence, didn’t come round a horse. That’s the way it fell today but in the future we’ve got a very good horse.” My Wish holds an entry for the Group One Champions Mile at the end of next month, but Newnham isn’t yet sure where his stable star will head next. “He’s a very good horse, there’s no doubt about that. In all his starts, he’s never run badly,” said the Australian handler. “He’s missed a place once and that was his first start at 1,000m. I think there’s still improvement to come in him next year, so there’s a very good future for him. “He didn’t quite get the job done today but I’m sure his turn will come.” While a third Derby victory narrowly eluded him, Joao Moreira had a fruitful afternoon at Sha Tin all the same, landing a double with victories aboard Packing Hermod and Master Trillion. Moreira may have thought he was poised to add to his Derby victories aboard Rapper Dragon (2017) and Sky Darci (2021) when Packing Angel travelled strongly into the race from midfield, but the Francis Lui Kin-wai-trained galloper couldn’t quite go on with it and had to settle for a neck third. “He ran terrific. He travelled a little bit strong – if he relaxed a little bit more the result could have been different, but that was a huge run,” said Moreira. It was a different story for stablemate Packing Hermod, who stepped back in trip for the Class Two Rapper Dragon Handicap (1,400m) after running in the first two legs of the Classic Series. Packing Hermod equals the 1400m Sha Tin track record with a slick 1m 19.92s! Joao Moreira does the riding for Francis Lui at Sha Tin... 🚀@cavaleiro83 | #4YOSeries | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/BOQkvkKC4d Sent off a $2.05 favourite, Packing Hermod closed strongly from a midfield position to defeat Young Champion by three-quarters of a length and stay perfect in two runs under Moreira. On a day featuring quick times across the card, Packing Hermod stopped the clock in 1:19.92 to equal Encouraging’s 1,400m Sha Tin track record. Moreira was one of three big-name jockeys to jet into Hong Kong and bag a brace, with Craig Williams successful aboard Cap Ferrat in the Derby and Endeared, while Ryan Moore saluted aboard Super Express and Invincible Shield. The victory of debutant Super Express in the Class Four Luger Handicap (1,400m) was the first of a double for John Size, who also delivered with Endeared. Trainer Caspar Fownes and French jockey Antoine Hamelin teamed up for their first winner at their 35th attempt as Sky Deep broke his maiden at start six in the Class Four Sky Darci Handicap (1,400m). After consecutive seconds, including last start under Hamelin when he lost his way in the straight and hit the running rail, Sky Deep fended off Harold Win late to grab an overdue success. Three wins from his last nine rides! 🙌

It’s hard in Hong Kong, but he’s done nothing wrong on this horse,” Fownes said of Hamelin, who has ridden three winners from his last nine rides to move to five victories for the season. “The horse is quite immature and has his own mind a little bit. We’re trying to teach him the right way. “It’s good for Antoine. It’s his first winner for me and I think this horse has a chance to win again. “I think next season this horse will be a different horse.

On his 11th attempt, the star Australian jockey achieved that feat in a thrilling finish, lifting $26.7 chance Cap Ferrat to a remarkable maiden victory at Sha Tin on Sunday. “It’s great riding all around the world. Hong Kong is a place where I was very fortunate to get a contract and it made me the rider and the person I am today,” Williams said. “It’s lovely that I can come here with really nice horses [and] good friends that I have known for so many years in the crowd.

[Trainer] Francis Lui [Kin-wai] was a very big supporter of mine going way back 20 years ago, it’s very special.” Williams maintained the faith in Cap Ferrat and Lui despite the son of Snitzel falling short of expectations in the lead up to the Derby. The prolific Group One-winning jockey answered the call-up from Lui to ride Cap Ferrat in the Classic Cup (1,800m), but a wide draw in barrier 10 forced him to work hard in the early stages and took a toll late when he ran ninth behind Rubylot. “Francis rang me, he was at the Sydney yearling sales and I was on the Gold Coast and he said ‘would you like to come ride Cap Ferrat?’,” Williams said. “I rode him when he was in Australia and I liked the horse. He had good 10-furlong form, he had two runs in Hong Kong – one was really good and one not so good – and I said ‘I’d love to come over and ride him for you’. “I rode him a few weeks ago and said ‘if you get him right Francis, we know he’s got the right form and the capability’, but it was up to Francis and his stable. “When he walked into the yard, the way he performed and he won, that’s why Francis is such a great trainer. Full credit’s got to go to Francis Lui, his team and obviously the horse. It gives me a great thrill.” Williams had Cap Ferrat perfectly placed from gate two, trailing pacesetter Lo Rider before taking a run on the inside rail to hit the front at the 150m. He scrambled in by a short head from My Wish, capping a double for Williams after he booted home John Size’s Endeared in the Class Three Ambitious Dragon Handicap (1,400m). This season marked Williams’ return to Hong Kong to ride for the first time since 2019. The now 47-year-old rode in the city full-time in 2003-04 and 2004-05, booting home 32 and 35 wins respectively. His biggest Hong Kong victory was on Dunaden in the Group One Hong Kong Vase (2,400m) in 2011."

Sent out a $26.7 chance after unlucky runs in the Classic Mile and Classic Cup (1,800m), Cap Ferrat lived up to his pre-import form by holding on late to narrowly beat My Wish in a pulsating finish. After a cosy run in the box seat under Craig Williams, Cap Ferrat capitalised on an inside run to snatch the lead at the 150m and prevail by a short head from the fast-finishing My Wish. “I still feel very excited,” said Lui after adding the triumph to his first Derby success with champion galloper Golden Sixty in 2020.

The son of Snitzel arrived in Hong Kong as one of Australia’s highest-profile maidens, having been placed in four stakes races including the Group One Spring Champion Stakes (2,000m) and Group One Rosehill Guineas (2,000m). His move to Lui started on a positive note when he ran an eye-catching second to Mickley over 1,600m in December. However, his Classic Mile tilt was thwarted by a wide run without cover throughout when 12th behind My Wish. He then could only manage ninth behind Rubylot in the Classic Cup after working hard early from gate 10. “The last two runs he had [wide runs] and bad luck,” Lui said. “I checked his [Australian] record and Craig rode this horse, so he knew the horse. Today he also had a good draw [barrier two], he was very lucky and Craig knows how to ride this horse. He did a good job.” Lui’s Packing Angel ran on strongly for a close third, while the $2.9 favourite Rubylot could only manage fifth after finishing solidly without threatening. Lui’s second Derby win continued an incredible run of success for a trainer who battled in the bottom half of the championship for the first 20 years of his career. The 66-year-old has been on the rise since Golden Sixty and he won his maiden title in remarkable fashion last year, claiming four of the last five races of the season to beat Pierre Ng Pang-chi by a solitary victory. Cap Ferrat crowned a treble for Lui at Sha Tin, with the veteran also striking with Packing Hermod in the Class Two Rapper Dragon Handicap (1,400m) and Invincible Shield in the Class Three Werther Handicap (1,200m). Dropped back in trip after contesting the Classic Mile and Classic Cup, Packing Hermod will be thrust into feature races in the future after his fifth win from nine starts will see him rated close to 100. “It depends because he’s had some hard racing this season and he’s still young,” Lui said after Packing Hermod equalled the track record when he beat Young Champion by three-quarters of a length. “I think he still has room to improve, this horse.” Another Australian import, Invincible Shield, continued his impressive start to his Hong Kong career with a second straight victory. Despite rising 11 pounds on his second-up win, the son of I Am Invincible ran on powerfully to beat Triumphant More by a length and a quarter under Ryan Moore."

While Zac Purton is in the final stages of his return from injury and Hugh Bowman rides outsider Lo Rider, Moreira joins forces with one of the more-fancied chances in the Francis Lui Kin-wai-trained Packing Angel. A close fourth behind Rubylot in the Classic Cup (1,800m) after three straight wins at 1,400m, Packing Angel – a son of Melbourne Cup winner Shocking – looks well equipped to run the 2,000m of the Derby and Moreira should be able to find a prominent position with cover from gate six. “I hope in his last run he learned a little bit more and Joao also knows him [now],” said Lui of Packing Angel, who was ridden by Moreira for the first time in the Classic Cup.

He only had six runs before the Classic Cup and he just went straight from 1,400m to 1,800m, which is a little bit much for a young horse.” While Moreira enjoyed Derby success in 2017 with Rapper Dragon and 2021 with Sky Darci, Lui will chase a second win in five years after snaring the 2020 edition of the race with the great Golden Sixty. “It’s the owner’s dream for their four-year-old horses. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime chance and it’s a very special race. Hopefully, I can win it again this year,” Lui said. While Packing Angel is Lui’s leading chance in a race where the David Hayes-trained Rubylot is expected to lead the market, the veteran handler will also be represented by Cap Ferrat and Steps Ahead. Cap Ferrat will be ridden by Craig Williams and Lyle Hewitson pilots Steps Ahead for the 66-year-old. “[Cap Ferrat has] drawn barrier two, which is a good draw. The connections expected it, they’re happy. I think he has a chance,” said Lui of his son of Snitzel, who finished ninth from gate 10 in the Classic Cup. “He had a bad draw and he had to use him a little bit more in front last time. It’s much easier to relax him from gate two. Hopefully, we can find a good position. “[Steps Ahead is] an honest horse and he’s in good form. He always tries hard and you never know.” Moreira, who jets into Hong Kong for the third time this season, will be busy on the Derby undercard, jumping aboard The Heir, Packing Hermod, Island Breezes, Parterre, Everyone’s Star, Master Trillion and Pakistan Legacy. After piloting Packing Hermod to victory on international day in December, he fittingly partners Lui’s four-year-old in Sunday’s Class Two Rapper Dragon Handicap (1,400m)."

Fresh off victory in the Classic Cup (1,800m), the syndicate’s finest-ever find, Rubylot, enters the Derby as favourite for trainer David Hayes and jockey Brenton Avdulla. “We’ve been racing horses now for 40 years and this is by far the best we’ve ever had. I’ve been in the syndicate for 30 years myself and we’ve some good horses over the years, but this one is a bit special,” said Philip Nunn, the syndicate’s treasurer and manager. “We’ve had some good horses but a lot of it is luck. We’re not big spenders but David Hayes has been very good for us. He sources our horses for us and he’s reliable. Rubylot mows them down in the Hong Kong Classic Cup at Sha Tin! My Wish is brave in defeat as @brentonavdulla and David Hayes combine for victory... 🏆#4YOSeries | #LoveRacing | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/5YiJeHY1Ub “I think that’s the important thing – you have to have someone you can trust to get the right horses for you. We’re really thankful to David for choosing Rubylot for us.” Currently featuring 12 members, the syndicate has had a string of horses over the years, most with “lot” in their names. “Anyone can join but we’re generally Football Club members and Jockey Club members,” said Nunn. “I think I’m right in saying we were the very first syndicate to be registered by the Jockey Club. “We just have lots of fun. It’s a good social group. We never expected to have a horse quite so good as Rubylot. “In the old days you used to draw out a horse. You didn’t buy your own horse, you entered into a ballot and then you drew out a number and you got that horse. “The very first horse we ever had was called My Lot and he won several races. He was a really good horse, so we thought ‘lot’ was a good name for all our horses. “We always try to link the ‘lot’ with the name of the sire or the dam. That’s been our tradition over the years.” With six wins from 18 starts, including three victories this season, the group’s dashing son of Rubick enters the Derby as the only galloper with a triple-figure rating on a mark of 100. A victory from Rubylot would mark a second Derby success for Hayes, who prevailed in 2003 with Elegant Fashion, and a first for Avdulla. “He begins, switches off and he’s got a change-up speed, so he’s got three brilliant things going for him,” Avdulla said of Rubylot. “It will be interesting to see how he handles the 2,000m. I think he will. “He’s a lovely moving horse and the way he finished in the Classic Cup should hold him in good stead for the 2,000m.” As Avdulla carefully positions Rubylot out of gate four from the tricky Sha Tin 2,000m start, those in the Hong Kong Football Club Horse Racing Syndicate will be watching intently from the box of Jockey Club steward Nicholas Hunsworth. “He’s one of the syndicate’s main players so we’ll be in his box, fortunately,” said Nunn, who did his bit for the cause by revealing barrier four at Thursday’s draw – a gate Hayes described as perfect."

Hodge, a small-time trainer in the New South Wales city of Newcastle for almost four decades, and his two close friends took a chance on Set The Tone when the broodmare prospect’s owner put her up for sale. With only one win to her name at the remote racecourse of Tuncurry, Set The Tone came with a lowly price tag of A$3000 (HK$14,634) while in foal to Eurozone. “I trained her and the bloke that owned her got her in foal and was cutting down his number of horses,” Hodge recalled. Classy as! 👏

                        My Wish staves off challengers to capture the first #4YOSeries leg - the HK$13 million Hong Kong Classic Mile - with @LukeFerraris for Mark Newnham... #LoveRacing | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/Zl6reIm7X3 “A couple of my friends and I decided to buy her and then about two months later, she slipped the foal. “We had a free return to Eurozone, but it had moved on from Newgate Farm up in the Hunter Valley, so they said they’ll honour the free return with another stallion. We got her served by Flying Artie and My Wish was the result.” Initially named Lika Ryder, the small son of Flying Artie stepped out for his first trial at Hodge’s home track in 2023 and quickly created a huge buzz, bolting in by more than four lengths. “He jumped out and did it easy and all the bloodstock agents were ringing wanting to buy him for Hong Kong,” Hodge said. “We were just going to break him in and race him ourselves. The prize money’s so good here in New South Wales, but when he won his trial so well, everyone was keen to buy him and the money was good, so we thought we’d sell him.” Now named My Wish and trained by Mark Newnham, the gelding has rocketed into BMW Hong Kong Derby (2,000m) contention and has Hodge and the Marshalls dreaming of a major breeding success on Sunday. My Wish has been a revelation for Newnham in his second season training in Hong Kong, notching four wins – including a fighting Classic Mile triumph in January – and a last-start second to Derby favourite Rubylot in the Classic Cup (1,800m). “We’re only small-time breeders, we’ve only got one or two mares,” Hodge said. “To breed one running in a Derby in Hong Kong is a pretty big thing. Mark’s done an unbelievable job with him and Luke [Ferraris] rides him so well. Hopefully it all falls into place for them. “I knew Mark when he was a jockey. He had rides for me, as a matter of fact, back in the day. He’s a great trainer and a great person.” Hodge will be at Sha Tin for the city’s most prestigious race on Sunday, but it won’t be his first trip to Hong Kong. “I went over in December for the two big meetings and I was there 29 years ago,” Hodge said. “Kris Lees and I took [Potential Star] over for Kris’ father, Max. It was in the [QE II Cup]. It went no good, but I was there for a month and had a good time. Rubylot mows them down in the Hong Kong Classic Cup at Sha Tin! My Wish is brave in defeat as @brentonavdulla and David Hayes combine for victory... 🏆#4YOSeries | #LoveRacing | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/5YiJeHY1Ub “It will be good to catch up with Mark and hopefully cheer My Wish home.” If My Wish overcomes the widest draw in barrier 14 to claim Derby glory, it will boost the value of his full-brother that Hodge and the Marshalls have on their hands. “He was just weaned last week. He’s a really nice horse,” Hodge said. “We didn’t put the mare back in foal for a couple of years after My Wish. When he showed the ability and was sold to Hong Kong, we went and picked her up and had her served by Flying Artie again. “If My Wish happens to win the Derby, this foal should be worth a bit and might make it through the yearling sales. We’ve got the mare back in foal to Hawaii Five Oh.”"

Sidelined since February 9, after fracturing his left big toe in a race fall, Purton is on track to partner the superstar sprinter in the Group Two Sprint Cup (1,200m) at Sha Tin on March 30. Purton, who returned to riding trackwork on Thursday morning, said while he had not fully recovered, he was “a long way down the track”. “I feel pretty good. I’m at the track riding work and riding trials because I feel like we can go again,” he added. “I’m gearing up for a return next week unless I pick up a ride in the Derby.” Perfect tune-up for Ka Ying Rising! 😏

His mental attitude towards it, he seems to be handling it better all the time. He enjoyed himself. I’m looking forward to the races ahead.” While Purton is all but certain to miss this Sunday’s BMW Hong Kong Derby (2,000m) meeting, he expects to have a full book next weekend, including Galaxy Patch in the Group Two Chairman’s Trophy (1,600m). One jockey who is riding in this weekend’s Derby is Hugh Bowman, but not before he jets to Australia for Saturday’s Golden Slipper Day at Rosehill Gardens in Sydney. Bowman partners the Kris Lees-trained Rivellino in the Group One Golden Slipper (1,200m), while he also jumps aboard Celestial Legend for Hong Kong owner Boniface Ho Ka-kui in the Group One George Ryder Stakes (1,500m) and Mazu in the Group One The Galaxy (1,100m)."

While there are six jockeys riding in Sunday’s Derby that already feature on the race’s honour roll, four of the top five chances in overseas fixed-odds markets will be ridden by jockeys chasing a maiden success in the coveted contest. Part of the reason for this is the absence of the injured Zac Purton, but it speaks to the rise of Brenton Avdulla (Rubylot) and Luke Ferraris (My Wish) that they would have been aboard their mounts – the first and second favourites – whether or not the seven-time champion jockey was available. Whether the same can be said for Ben Thompson (Bundle Award) and Andrea Atzeni (Johannes Brahms) is debatable, but what isn’t is the fact that pair are red-hot chances to experience Derby euphoria for the first time this weekend. Thompson is one of two jockeys riding in the Derby for the first time – the other, the recently arrived James Orman, will tackle Sha Tin’s tricky 2,000m start under race conditions for the first time. At the other end of the scale, Joao Moreira (Packing Angel) and Hugh Bowman (Lo Rider) chase their third victories in the city’s most prestigious race. If either is successful, they will draw level with Gerald Mosse and Douglas Whyte for wins but will still be one short of the most successful Derby rider in the professional era – four-time victor Tony Cruz. From a training perspective, Cruz (Californiatotality and Stunning Peach) and Caspar Fownes (Lo Rider) chase their third wins, while John Size (Bundle Award, Mickley and Beauty Alliance) hunts Derby win number four. Legendary Australian handler John Moore sits out in front with six successes. While wide gates can be far from ideal over the Sha Tin 2,000m with its short run to the first turn, the Derby has been one 10-furlong contest where double-figure draws have not been the end of the world. Since the Derby became a 2,000m race in the year 2000, three gallopers have won the race from the outside gate of 14, including Voyage Bubble in 2023, and Classic Mile winner My Wish will bid to become the fourth this weekend. 🏆BMW Hong Kong Derby 2023

Lo Rider (gate one) and Beauty Alliance (five) are the gallopers needing to create history to win – no horse has won the Derby from either of those alleys since 2000. Gate nine has also produced three winners since 2000 and it’s a barrier that gives Thompson a good feeling. “It’s funny, on the way over I said to my wife Steph that I just want a number that feels lucky and my brother’s born on the 9th, so hopefully that brings us some luck,” said Bundle Award’s jockey. Once the domain of the Private Purchase (previously raced horse), the previously unraced galloper has very much come to the fore in the Derby in recent years. While 15 of this century’s first 20 Derby winners began their careers elsewhere, the four winners from 2020 to 2023 – Golden Sixty, Sky Darci, Romantic Warrior and Voyage Bubble – were all unraced when they came to Hong Kong. Phenomenal win! 🤯

After Massive Sovereign won last year’s Derby, having begun his career under Aidan O’Brien in Ireland, Cap Ferrat pulled off a superb upset at Sha Tin on Sunday following 13 starts for Chris Waller in Australia. “It’s absolutely massive for us. It’s a big deal,” Mick Flanagan, Coolmore’s head of international sales, told the Post. “To be able to go to Sha Tin [on Sunday] having sold last year’s Derby winner and to see the owners celebrating, it’s just unbelievable. “We sold 10 horses to Hong Kong last year, which is a lot, and we’d like to do the same again this year, if not more.

Coolmore predominantly is a stallion farm and the main driver of the business is stallion revenue. “There’s a big farming business behind it, a lot of land and a lot of families employed. We’re still a commercial operation, so we have to sell anything that isn’t going to make it as a stallion.” HISTORY AT SHA TIN! 👏👏@CWilliamsJockey wins the 148th @BMW Hong Kong Derby aboard Cap Ferrat for trainer Francis Lui over a fast-closing My Wish... #4YOSeries | #LoveRacing | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/OHHfz0JKlE Flanagan confirmed interest in Coolmore three-year-olds who could target the 2026 Hong Kong Derby as four-year-olds would ramp up around June. “I think the picture is clearer post Royal Ascot. We start to decipher what will make the stallion barn and what we maybe need to move onto different jurisdictions,” he said. “Hong Kong is a great market for both the northern and southern hemisphere, but in the northern hemisphere we have Saudi [Arabia], Bahrain, Dubai and the [United] States as well, so when our horses come up for sale it’s pretty hot competition. “We’re lucky as salesmen that we have a good product to sell – they’re the best bred, they’re the best looking and they’re very sound.” A year after Massive Sovereign took a massive 25-point hit for his Derby success, Cap Ferrat has been slugged a sizeable 19 points for his triumph in the Classic Series finale. While Massive Sovereign was lifted to a rating of 107 following his Derby win, Cap Ferrat now sits on a mark of 102 – the same as Romantic Warrior after his triumph in the race and one point less than Voyage Bubble. Runner-up My Wish moved to a rating of 101 after receiving a four-point hike for his effort. Cap Ferrat’s victory was witnessed by a record Derby Day crowd of 61,681 at Sha Tin, with an unprecedented 8,567 of those on course travelling from the mainland to witness Hong Kong’s most prestigious race. Those numbers came just days after the Jockey Club formalised a partnership with China Travel Service Hong Kong (CTS), something chief executive Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges labelled “very significant”. A continuation of the club’s efforts to promote tourism in the Greater Bay Area, the memorandum of understanding it signed with CTS will “jointly promote horse racing tourism by including Happy Valley, Sha Tin and Conghua racecourses into CTS travel itineraries”."

While Purton will miss Wednesday night’s all-dirt fixture at Sha Tin, Hayes will saddle up seven runners and he likes the chances of Solid Shalaa, who races for the first time since April last year in the Class Four Kestrel Handicap (1,200m). “I think Solid Shalaa should go pretty close first up. He looks ready to win,” said Hayes. “He’s been off the scene a long time but he seems to have come back very well. “He hurt his leg coming back from a tendon tear, but he’s trialled very well.”"

After being lumped with the outside gate of 14, Newnham and Ferraris hatched a plan to take second favourite My Wish – who has done most of his racing on or near the speed – back to last. In a race run at a crawl from the 1,600m to the 800m before they rattled home, Ferraris unleashed My Wish in the home straight but the Classic Mile winner fell just short of winner Cap Ferrat despite steaming home with a final 400m of 21.39 seconds. “Very brave. He’s been the best four-year-old through the series,” said Newnham after My Wish added a Derby second to his runner-up finish in the Classic Cup (1,800m) earlier this month. HISTORY AT SHA TIN! 👏👏@CWilliamsJockey wins the 148th @BMW Hong Kong Derby aboard Cap Ferrat for trainer Francis Lui over a fast-closing My Wish... #4YOSeries | #LoveRacing | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/OHHfz0JKlE “On Thursday, we probably knew our fate but to run so close, it’s disappointing. We came up with a plan of where to ride him and how to ride him. All that went to script except we got beaten a short head. “We needed to do something from gate 14. It was no good going out there just hoping to get a spot. I thought our best chance was just to get him to relax, conserve energy and use his sprint. “He did all those things and Luke did all the right things, we just didn’t quite win. “The winner – gate two, third on the fence, didn’t come round a horse. That’s the way it fell today but in the future we’ve got a very good horse.” My Wish holds an entry for the Group One Champions Mile at the end of next month, but Newnham isn’t yet sure where his stable star will head next. “He’s a very good horse, there’s no doubt about that. In all his starts, he’s never run badly,” said the Australian handler. “He’s missed a place once and that was his first start at 1,000m. I think there’s still improvement to come in him next year, so there’s a very good future for him. “He didn’t quite get the job done today but I’m sure his turn will come.” While a third Derby victory narrowly eluded him, Joao Moreira had a fruitful afternoon at Sha Tin all the same, landing a double with victories aboard Packing Hermod and Master Trillion. Moreira may have thought he was poised to add to his Derby victories aboard Rapper Dragon (2017) and Sky Darci (2021) when Packing Angel travelled strongly into the race from midfield, but the Francis Lui Kin-wai-trained galloper couldn’t quite go on with it and had to settle for a neck third. “He ran terrific. He travelled a little bit strong – if he relaxed a little bit more the result could have been different, but that was a huge run,” said Moreira. It was a different story for stablemate Packing Hermod, who stepped back in trip for the Class Two Rapper Dragon Handicap (1,400m) after running in the first two legs of the Classic Series. Packing Hermod equals the 1400m Sha Tin track record with a slick 1m 19.92s! Joao Moreira does the riding for Francis Lui at Sha Tin... 🚀@cavaleiro83 | #4YOSeries | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/BOQkvkKC4d Sent off a $2.05 favourite, Packing Hermod closed strongly from a midfield position to defeat Young Champion by three-quarters of a length and stay perfect in two runs under Moreira. On a day featuring quick times across the card, Packing Hermod stopped the clock in 1:19.92 to equal Encouraging’s 1,400m Sha Tin track record. Moreira was one of three big-name jockeys to jet into Hong Kong and bag a brace, with Craig Williams successful aboard Cap Ferrat in the Derby and Endeared, while Ryan Moore saluted aboard Super Express and Invincible Shield. The victory of debutant Super Express in the Class Four Luger Handicap (1,400m) was the first of a double for John Size, who also delivered with Endeared. Trainer Caspar Fownes and French jockey Antoine Hamelin teamed up for their first winner at their 35th attempt as Sky Deep broke his maiden at start six in the Class Four Sky Darci Handicap (1,400m). After consecutive seconds, including last start under Hamelin when he lost his way in the straight and hit the running rail, Sky Deep fended off Harold Win late to grab an overdue success. Three wins from his last nine rides! 🙌

It’s hard in Hong Kong, but he’s done nothing wrong on this horse,” Fownes said of Hamelin, who has ridden three winners from his last nine rides to move to five victories for the season. “The horse is quite immature and has his own mind a little bit. We’re trying to teach him the right way. “It’s good for Antoine. It’s his first winner for me and I think this horse has a chance to win again. “I think next season this horse will be a different horse.

On his 11th attempt, the star Australian jockey achieved that feat in a thrilling finish, lifting $26.7 chance Cap Ferrat to a remarkable maiden victory at Sha Tin on Sunday. “It’s great riding all around the world. Hong Kong is a place where I was very fortunate to get a contract and it made me the rider and the person I am today,” Williams said. “It’s lovely that I can come here with really nice horses [and] good friends that I have known for so many years in the crowd. HISTORY AT SHA TIN! 👏👏@CWilliamsJockey wins the 148th @BMW Hong Kong Derby aboard Cap Ferrat for trainer Francis Lui over a fast-closing My Wish... #4YOSeries | #LoveRacing | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/OHHfz0JKlE “The winning feeling doesn’t get any sweeter, to win one of the greatest races here in Hong Kong. [Trainer] Francis Lui [Kin-wai] was a very big supporter of mine going way back 20 years ago, it’s very special.” Williams maintained the faith in Cap Ferrat and Lui despite the son of Snitzel falling short of expectations in the lead up to the Derby. The prolific Group One-winning jockey answered the call-up from Lui to ride Cap Ferrat in the Classic Cup (1,800m), but a wide draw in barrier 10 forced him to work hard in the early stages and took a toll late when he ran ninth behind Rubylot. “Francis rang me, he was at the Sydney yearling sales and I was on the Gold Coast and he said ‘would you like to come ride Cap Ferrat?’,” Williams said. “I rode him when he was in Australia and I liked the horse. He had good 10-furlong form, he had two runs in Hong Kong – one was really good and one not so good – and I said ‘I’d love to come over and ride him for you’. “I rode him a few weeks ago and said ‘if you get him right Francis, we know he’s got the right form and the capability’, but it was up to Francis and his stable. “When he walked into the yard, the way he performed and he won, that’s why Francis is such a great trainer. Full credit’s got to go to Francis Lui, his team and obviously the horse. It gives me a great thrill.” Williams had Cap Ferrat perfectly placed from gate two, trailing pacesetter Lo Rider before taking a run on the inside rail to hit the front at the 150m. He scrambled in by a short head from My Wish, capping a double for Williams after he booted home John Size’s Endeared in the Class Three Ambitious Dragon Handicap (1,400m). This season marked Williams’ return to Hong Kong to ride for the first time since 2019. The now 47-year-old rode in the city full-time in 2003-04 and 2004-05, booting home 32 and 35 wins respectively. His biggest Hong Kong victory was on Dunaden in the Group One Hong Kong Vase (2,400m) in 2011."

Sent out a $26.7 chance after unlucky runs in the Classic Mile and Classic Cup (1,800m), Cap Ferrat lived up to his pre-import form by holding on late to narrowly beat My Wish in a pulsating finish. After a cosy run in the box seat under Craig Williams, Cap Ferrat capitalised on an inside run to snatch the lead at the 150m and prevail by a short head from the fast-finishing My Wish. “I still feel very excited,” said Lui after adding the triumph to his first Derby success with champion galloper Golden Sixty in 2020. HISTORY AT SHA TIN! 👏👏@CWilliamsJockey wins the 148th @BMW Hong Kong Derby aboard Cap Ferrat for trainer Francis Lui over a fast-closing My Wish... #4YOSeries | #LoveRacing | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/OHHfz0JKlE “I watched [the replay] three times and then I got confident he won the race.” Cap Ferrat was the first Hong Kong maiden to win the Derby in 35 years – Reliable Source landed his first victory in the city in the prestigious race in 1990 – while it’s unclear if a maiden has ever won the feature. The son of Snitzel arrived in Hong Kong as one of Australia’s highest-profile maidens, having been placed in four stakes races including the Group One Spring Champion Stakes (2,000m) and Group One Rosehill Guineas (2,000m). His move to Lui started on a positive note when he ran an eye-catching second to Mickley over 1,600m in December. However, his Classic Mile tilt was thwarted by a wide run without cover throughout when 12th behind My Wish. He then could only manage ninth behind Rubylot in the Classic Cup after working hard early from gate 10. “The last two runs he had [wide runs] and bad luck,” Lui said. “I checked his [Australian] record and Craig rode this horse, so he knew the horse. Today he also had a good draw [barrier two], he was very lucky and Craig knows how to ride this horse. He did a good job.” Lui’s Packing Angel ran on strongly for a close third, while the $2.9 favourite Rubylot could only manage fifth after finishing solidly without threatening. Lui’s second Derby win continued an incredible run of success for a trainer who battled in the bottom half of the championship for the first 20 years of his career. The 66-year-old has been on the rise since Golden Sixty and he won his maiden title in remarkable fashion last year, claiming four of the last five races of the season to beat Pierre Ng Pang-chi by a solitary victory. Cap Ferrat crowned a treble for Lui at Sha Tin, with the veteran also striking with Packing Hermod in the Class Two Rapper Dragon Handicap (1,400m) and Invincible Shield in the Class Three Werther Handicap (1,200m). Dropped back in trip after contesting the Classic Mile and Classic Cup, Packing Hermod will be thrust into feature races in the future after his fifth win from nine starts will see him rated close to 100. “It depends because he’s had some hard racing this season and he’s still young,” Lui said after Packing Hermod equalled the track record when he beat Young Champion by three-quarters of a length. “I think he still has room to improve, this horse.” Another Australian import, Invincible Shield, continued his impressive start to his Hong Kong career with a second straight victory. Despite rising 11 pounds on his second-up win, the son of I Am Invincible ran on powerfully to beat Triumphant More by a length and a quarter under Ryan Moore."

While Zac Purton is in the final stages of his return from injury and Hugh Bowman rides outsider Lo Rider, Moreira joins forces with one of the more-fancied chances in the Francis Lui Kin-wai-trained Packing Angel. A close fourth behind Rubylot in the Classic Cup (1,800m) after three straight wins at 1,400m, Packing Angel – a son of Melbourne Cup winner Shocking – looks well equipped to run the 2,000m of the Derby and Moreira should be able to find a prominent position with cover from gate six. “I hope in his last run he learned a little bit more and Joao also knows him [now],” said Lui of Packing Angel, who was ridden by Moreira for the first time in the Classic Cup.

He only had six runs before the Classic Cup and he just went straight from 1,400m to 1,800m, which is a little bit much for a young horse.” While Moreira enjoyed Derby success in 2017 with Rapper Dragon and 2021 with Sky Darci, Lui will chase a second win in five years after snaring the 2020 edition of the race with the great Golden Sixty. “It’s the owner’s dream for their four-year-old horses. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime chance and it’s a very special race. Hopefully, I can win it again this year,” Lui said. While Packing Angel is Lui’s leading chance in a race where the David Hayes-trained Rubylot is expected to lead the market, the veteran handler will also be represented by Cap Ferrat and Steps Ahead. Cap Ferrat will be ridden by Craig Williams and Lyle Hewitson pilots Steps Ahead for the 66-year-old. “[Cap Ferrat has] drawn barrier two, which is a good draw. The connections expected it, they’re happy. I think he has a chance,” said Lui of his son of Snitzel, who finished ninth from gate 10 in the Classic Cup. “He had a bad draw and he had to use him a little bit more in front last time. It’s much easier to relax him from gate two. Hopefully, we can find a good position. “[Steps Ahead is] an honest horse and he’s in good form. He always tries hard and you never know.” Moreira, who jets into Hong Kong for the third time this season, will be busy on the Derby undercard, jumping aboard The Heir, Packing Hermod, Island Breezes, Parterre, Everyone’s Star, Master Trillion and Pakistan Legacy. After piloting Packing Hermod to victory on international day in December, he fittingly partners Lui’s four-year-old in Sunday’s Class Two Rapper Dragon Handicap (1,400m)."

Fresh off victory in the Classic Cup (1,800m), the syndicate’s finest-ever find, Rubylot, enters the Derby as favourite for trainer David Hayes and jockey Brenton Avdulla. “We’ve been racing horses now for 40 years and this is by far the best we’ve ever had. I’ve been in the syndicate for 30 years myself and we’ve some good horses over the years, but this one is a bit special,” said Philip Nunn, the syndicate’s treasurer and manager. “We’ve had some good horses but a lot of it is luck. We’re not big spenders but David Hayes has been very good for us. He sources our horses for us and he’s reliable. Rubylot mows them down in the Hong Kong Classic Cup at Sha Tin! My Wish is brave in defeat as @brentonavdulla and David Hayes combine for victory... 🏆#4YOSeries | #LoveRacing | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/5YiJeHY1Ub “I think that’s the important thing – you have to have someone you can trust to get the right horses for you. We’re really thankful to David for choosing Rubylot for us.” Currently featuring 12 members, the syndicate has had a string of horses over the years, most with “lot” in their names. “Anyone can join but we’re generally Football Club members and Jockey Club members,” said Nunn. “I think I’m right in saying we were the very first syndicate to be registered by the Jockey Club. “We just have lots of fun. It’s a good social group. We never expected to have a horse quite so good as Rubylot. “In the old days you used to draw out a horse. You didn’t buy your own horse, you entered into a ballot and then you drew out a number and you got that horse. “The very first horse we ever had was called My Lot and he won several races. He was a really good horse, so we thought ‘lot’ was a good name for all our horses. “We always try to link the ‘lot’ with the name of the sire or the dam. That’s been our tradition over the years.” With six wins from 18 starts, including three victories this season, the group’s dashing son of Rubick enters the Derby as the only galloper with a triple-figure rating on a mark of 100. A victory from Rubylot would mark a second Derby success for Hayes, who prevailed in 2003 with Elegant Fashion, and a first for Avdulla. “He begins, switches off and he’s got a change-up speed, so he’s got three brilliant things going for him,” Avdulla said of Rubylot. “It will be interesting to see how he handles the 2,000m. I think he will. “He’s a lovely moving horse and the way he finished in the Classic Cup should hold him in good stead for the 2,000m.” As Avdulla carefully positions Rubylot out of gate four from the tricky Sha Tin 2,000m start, those in the Hong Kong Football Club Horse Racing Syndicate will be watching intently from the box of Jockey Club steward Nicholas Hunsworth. “He’s one of the syndicate’s main players so we’ll be in his box, fortunately,” said Nunn, who did his bit for the cause by revealing barrier four at Thursday’s draw – a gate Hayes described as perfect."

Hodge, a small-time trainer in the New South Wales city of Newcastle for almost four decades, and his two close friends took a chance on Set The Tone when the broodmare prospect’s owner put her up for sale. With only one win to her name at the remote racecourse of Tuncurry, Set The Tone came with a lowly price tag of A$3000 (HK$14,634) while in foal to Eurozone. “I trained her and the bloke that owned her got her in foal and was cutting down his number of horses,” Hodge recalled. Classy as! 👏

We got her served by Flying Artie and My Wish was the result.” Initially named Lika Ryder, the small son of Flying Artie stepped out for his first trial at Hodge’s home track in 2023 and quickly created a huge buzz, bolting in by more than four lengths. “He jumped out and did it easy and all the bloodstock agents were ringing wanting to buy him for Hong Kong,” Hodge said. “We were just going to break him in and race him ourselves. The prize money’s so good here in New South Wales, but when he won his trial so well, everyone was keen to buy him and the money was good, so we thought we’d sell him.” Now named My Wish and trained by Mark Newnham, the gelding has rocketed into BMW Hong Kong Derby (2,000m) contention and has Hodge and the Marshalls dreaming of a major breeding success on Sunday. My Wish has been a revelation for Newnham in his second season training in Hong Kong, notching four wins – including a fighting Classic Mile triumph in January – and a last-start second to Derby favourite Rubylot in the Classic Cup (1,800m). “We’re only small-time breeders, we’ve only got one or two mares,” Hodge said. “To breed one running in a Derby in Hong Kong is a pretty big thing. Mark’s done an unbelievable job with him and Luke [Ferraris] rides him so well. Hopefully it all falls into place for them. “I knew Mark when he was a jockey. He had rides for me, as a matter of fact, back in the day. He’s a great trainer and a great person.” Hodge will be at Sha Tin for the city’s most prestigious race on Sunday, but it won’t be his first trip to Hong Kong. “I went over in December for the two big meetings and I was there 29 years ago,” Hodge said. “Kris Lees and I took [Potential Star] over for Kris’ father, Max. It was in the [QE II Cup]. It went no good, but I was there for a month and had a good time. Rubylot mows them down in the Hong Kong Classic Cup at Sha Tin!

He’s a really nice horse,” Hodge said. “We didn’t put the mare back in foal for a couple of years after My Wish. When he showed the ability and was sold to Hong Kong, we went and picked her up and had her served by Flying Artie again. “If My Wish happens to win the Derby, this foal should be worth a bit and might make it through the yearling sales. We’ve got the mare back in foal to Hawaii Five Oh.”"

Sidelined since February 9, after fracturing his left big toe in a race fall, Purton is on track to partner the superstar sprinter in the Group Two Sprint Cup (1,200m) at Sha Tin on March 30. Purton, who returned to riding trackwork on Thursday morning, said while he had not fully recovered, he was “a long way down the track”. “I feel pretty good. I’m at the track riding work and riding trials because I feel like we can go again,” he added. “I’m gearing up for a return next week unless I pick up a ride in the Derby.” Perfect tune-up for Ka Ying Rising! 😏

                        The world's best sprinter is first across the line this morning at Sha Tin in his trial ahead of the likes of Sword Point, Helios Express and co. 🔥@zpurton | #LoveRacing | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/rqEvtLDNgS Ka Ying Rising travelled sweetly in the 1,200m dirt trial, sitting outside leader Sword Point before coasting past him late. “[Ka Ying Rising] just did what we expect from him this morning – he just keeps improving all the time,” Purton said of the three-time Group One winner. “He seems to do it easier all the time. His mental attitude towards it, he seems to be handling it better all the time. He enjoyed himself. I’m looking forward to the races ahead.” While Purton is all but certain to miss this Sunday’s BMW Hong Kong Derby (2,000m) meeting, he expects to have a full book next weekend, including Galaxy Patch in the Group Two Chairman’s Trophy (1,600m). One jockey who is riding in this weekend’s Derby is Hugh Bowman, but not before he jets to Australia for Saturday’s Golden Slipper Day at Rosehill Gardens in Sydney. Bowman partners the Kris Lees-trained Rivellino in the Group One Golden Slipper (1,200m), while he also jumps aboard Celestial Legend for Hong Kong owner Boniface Ho Ka-kui in the Group One George Ryder Stakes (1,500m) and Mazu in the Group One The Galaxy (1,100m)."

While there are six jockeys riding in Sunday’s Derby that already feature on the race’s honour roll, four of the top five chances in overseas fixed-odds markets will be ridden by jockeys chasing a maiden success in the coveted contest. Part of the reason for this is the absence of the injured Zac Purton, but it speaks to the rise of Brenton Avdulla (Rubylot) and Luke Ferraris (My Wish) that they would have been aboard their mounts – the first and second favourites – whether or not the seven-time champion jockey was available. Whether the same can be said for Ben Thompson (Bundle Award) and Andrea Atzeni (Johannes Brahms) is debatable, but what isn’t is the fact that pair are red-hot chances to experience Derby euphoria for the first time this weekend. Thompson is one of two jockeys riding in the Derby for the first time – the other, the recently arrived James Orman, will tackle Sha Tin’s tricky 2,000m start under race conditions for the first time. At the other end of the scale, Joao Moreira (Packing Angel) and Hugh Bowman (Lo Rider) chase their third victories in the city’s most prestigious race. If either is successful, they will draw level with Gerald Mosse and Douglas Whyte for wins but will still be one short of the most successful Derby rider in the professional era – four-time victor Tony Cruz. From a training perspective, Cruz (Californiatotality and Stunning Peach) and Caspar Fownes (Lo Rider) chase their third wins, while John Size (Bundle Award, Mickley and Beauty Alliance) hunts Derby win number four. Legendary Australian handler John Moore sits out in front with six successes. While wide gates can be far from ideal over the Sha Tin 2,000m with its short run to the first turn, the Derby has been one 10-furlong contest where double-figure draws have not been the end of the world. Since the Derby became a 2,000m race in the year 2000, three gallopers have won the race from the outside gate of 14, including Voyage Bubble in 2023, and Classic Mile winner My Wish will bid to become the fourth this weekend. 🏆BMW Hong Kong Derby 2023

Lo Rider (gate one) and Beauty Alliance (five) are the gallopers needing to create history to win – no horse has won the Derby from either of those alleys since 2000. Gate nine has also produced three winners since 2000 and it’s a barrier that gives Thompson a good feeling. “It’s funny, on the way over I said to my wife Steph that I just want a number that feels lucky and my brother’s born on the 9th, so hopefully that brings us some luck,” said Bundle Award’s jockey. Once the domain of the Private Purchase (previously raced horse), the previously unraced galloper has very much come to the fore in the Derby in recent years. While 15 of this century’s first 20 Derby winners began their careers elsewhere, the four winners from 2020 to 2023 – Golden Sixty, Sky Darci, Romantic Warrior and Voyage Bubble – were all unraced when they came to Hong Kong. Phenomenal win! 🤯

                        While we're reflecting on 2024, just how GOOD were Massive Sovereign and @zpurton in March's @BMW Hong Kong Derby at Sha Tin... 🏆#LoveRacing | #HKracing pic.twitter.com/e34fUbj0Zx Massive Sovereign ended that run last year, winning the Derby after beginning his career under the tutelage of Aidan O’Brien in Ireland. This year it is an even seven-seven split between horses who raced before coming to Hong Kong and those who didn’t, although the top two in the market – Rubylot and My Wish – are Private Purchase Griffins (previously unraced horses)."
